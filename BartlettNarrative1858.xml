            had lost the larger portion of their animals by famine. The following letter from Dr.
            Webb shows the character of his journey. €i Sax Diego, Cauforxia, February 14, 1852.
            "Sir : I have the honor to announce that I arrived here with the little party nnder my

            hardships, endure some privations — to be exposed to the hostile attacks and
            depredations of Indians, and subjected to the loss of most of our ani- mals and much of
            our clothing, and., and were necessa- rily placed on short allowance — compelled to walk
            a large portion of the distance, and be our own escort and night guard. " The mail
            closes so very soon, that it is impossible for me to render, in detail, a report of the
            trip at this time. I can only state, in brief, that the party con- sisted of twelve
            individuals and twenty-seven riding and pack-mules.' " The animals, which were mostly
            feeble at the outset, and consequently not suited for such a journey, soon gave
            convincing proofs that they could not hold out, and daily, after leaving the Pimo
            villages, be- came reduced in number — sinking under the combined influence of excessive
            heat, deficiency of grazing, and destitution of water. Of the twenty-seven, but three
            were in a suitable condition to be brought in ; five more I left at Williams's rancho,
            about fifty miles dis- tant, to recruit ; and the remainder sank under their loads at
            various places on the desert, and were necessa- rily abandoned to their fate ; which was
            either to fall into the hands of roving Indians, who, like so many hungry vultures, were
            continually hovering around, anxiously awaiting an opportunity to avail themselves of
            any accident or misfortune that might occur, whereby they could gain possession of any
            of our pro- perty ; or should they elude the Indians, their fate most NAPA VALLEY. 3
            inevitabi} was, in tlieir enfeebled state, to become an easy prey to the hungry wolves,
            which in great num- bers' were constantly prowling about, making night hideous with
            their bowlings ; and not unfrequently so impatient were they to seize upon the poor
            animals, that they could be seen skulking close to our camp in broad daylight. '• The
            loss of pack-mules of course occasioned a sacrifice of much other property, as we had no
            relief mules with us. Most of our cooking utensils were dropped from time to time, at
            various places on the route. We had also to cacJie all of our camp stools and other
            furniture, some of our bedding, much cloth- ing, books, papers, etc. Eventually, we were
            compelled to abandon our tents: so that rain or shine, wet or dry, we had to stop at the
            end of our day's journey in the open air, without any means of protection by day from
            the scorching heat of the sun ; and at night we stretched out upon the ground,
            unsheltered from the inclemency of the weather, and the cold searching blasts and chilly
            atmosphere, though at mid-day the dry, brain-burning heat, was almost too much to bear.
            Soon after sunset, an icy feeling, nearly as intolerable, would pervade us ; the
            variations between night and day often amounting to sixty and seventy degrees of temp
            Twelve days of the journey I walked, h o relinquished my animal for pack-mule purposes
            before we reached the junction of the Gila and Colorado Rivers. Subsequently, others
            followed the example; until at length but two retained possession of ani- mals. 4 SAN
            DIEGO TO "We had no escort; and therefore, after walking all day, we were obliged to
            take our turns at standing guard at niglit. Our provisions became so diminished in
            quantity as to compel me to put the whole party on short allowance. We lived principally
            on meat, mush, and mutton, without any vegetables. But one sheep (long, lank, raw-boned
            animals) was allowed to twelve men for four days, and even then our last meat was
            consumed a week before our arrival ; and we were forced to deprive ourselves of a
            portion of our mush to furnish food to our animals, owing to the entire absence, for
            several days on our route- of all grass, shrubs, and trees. " Much is said by travellers
            respecting the desert of Sahara ; but, in barrenness of verdure, destitution of water,
            tremendous storms of sand, etc., etc., it is doubtful if any tract of land can surpass
            the Jornada which we crossed. Indeed much of this country, that by those residing at a
            distance is imagined to be a perfect paradise, is a sterile waste, utterly worthless for
            any purpose than to constitute a barrier or natural line of demarcation between two
            neighboring nations. " Notwithstanding our many perils, privations, and snffering,
            mostly attributable, when traced to the true source, to our imperfect outfit at the
            Copper Mines, from the negligence, wilfulness, or some other unjusti- fiable cause on
            the part of those whose duty it was- to attend to the business; notwithstanding the many
            additional obstacles thrown in the way ; notwithstand- ing the continued succession of
            disappointments which we encountered in numerous shapes, and of varied hue, where the
            doing or neglecting to do, depended NAPA VALLEY. 5 upon the will of man ; thanks to the
            protecting care of a divine and overruling Providence, we escaped un- harmed from the
            many dangers with which we were surrounded, and the' difficulties in which we were
            involved, and have brought in our little party in the enjoyment, as already observed, of
            good health and * « pints. "I remain, sir, very respectfully, yours, « (Signed) THOMAS
            H. WEBB, Secretary to Boundary Commission. " Hex. J. R. Baetlett, " Commissioner
            etc.'''* The animals brought in by the several parties were greatly reduced by their
            long and painful journey, owing chiefly to their poor and scanty food along the Gila,
            and from that river to the coast. They were now placed in a grassy valley near the
            mission, some five or six miles distant, where the feed was pretty good ; but they were
            so completely broken down, that many weeks would be necessary to recruit them. The sur-
            veying parties during this time were engaged in re- ducing their observations and in
            plotting their ma23S. Although the entire boundary along the river Gila was not
            completed, it was a source of peculiar satisfac- tion to me that we had accomplished so
            much. It is more than the most sanfuine in the Commission expected to perform in so
            short a space of time, sur- rounded, as the operating parties were, with so many serious
            impediments. To cross a wilderness, such as it may in truth be called, from the Rio
            Grande to the ** 6 SAN DIEGO TO Pacific Ocean, a distance of more than eight hundred
            miles, would at any time be a labor of difficulty. But when this whole line is throurh a
            desolate region, with jX « vv.w.c..v. v.w a scanty supply of grass for the animals ;
            with large tracts destitute of water, and no means of procuring provisions; and
            furthermore, when nearly the entire distance is invested by hostile Indians, the work is
            one for the near completion of which we could not be too thankful. The whole came
            through in good health, and with the loss of but one man, Thomas Harper, an attendant on
            instruments in Lieutenant Whipple's party, who was unfortunately drowned whilst bathing
            in the Colorado. The amount of public property lost or abandoned on the journey was not
            large, and could easily be replaced in this country. During my short stay at San Diego,
            I was busily occupied in paying off and reducing the Commission. Several of the
            assistants desired to leave here, and the larger portion of the mechanics and laborers.
            Tn fact, I found it difficult to keep such as were necessary to take care of the animals
            and other property, as well as the cooks and servants needed to attend the several
            messes. Wages were exceedingly high, and I was compelled to advance the pay of all that
            remained to the California rates, which were from fifty to eighty dollars a month for
            servants, cooks, teamsters, and herdsmen. After reducing the parties, and placing those
            who remained in comfortable quarters (for the weather was cold and wet), I mae my
            arrangements to go to San Francisco, in order to procure a new out- fit of tents and
            camp equipage ; to have the instruments repaired and put in order ; to lay in provisions
            for our NAPA VALLEY. ' 7 return ; and to negotiate my drafts on tlie government to meet
            these several expenditures, as well as to pay the officers and men attached to the
            Commission. No event that is worthy of mention occurred here, except a visit from a band
            of Diegeno Indians. A chief and several of his tribe were sent to me at my request by a
            Californian gentleman. They were a mis- erable, ill-looking set, with dark brown
            complexions and emaciated bodies; and though the weather was cold, they were but
            slightly clad. Articles of old and cast-off clothing, such as a tattered shirt and
            panta- loons, were all that the best could boast of One, I think the chief, had a piece
            of a horse blanket around his cadaverous-looking body. I managed to get from them a
            vocabulary of their language ; though I must confess that, with the exception of the
            Apache, I never found one so difficult to express, in consequence of the gutturals and
            nasals with which it abounded. I finally got the words so correct, that the Indians
            could recog- nise them, and give me the Spanish equivalents. I tried to write down some
            short sentences, but was obliged to give up the attempt as unsuccessful. I could not
            combine the words so as to be understood, in a single instance. These Indians occupy the
            coast for some fifty miles above, and about the same distance below, San Diego, and
            extend about a hundred miles into the interior. They are the same who were known to the
            .first settlers as the Comeya tribe. I also found an Indian here from the Upper Sacra-
            mento River. He had been taken prisoner by the American troops about three years before,
            and was now living with some of the officers. He was quick and 8 SAX DIEGO TO F
            intelligent, and answered promptly my questions rela- tive to his tribe and country. I
            could not, however, " ascertain the precise locality of his people, which he called the
            ICIiana tribe — the Ho. deep guttural. I got from him. a complete vocabulary of his
            language. On the 24th of February, I embarked with sevejal officers of the Commission in
            the steamer Sea Bird, for San Francisco. The boat stopped on the way at the several
            ports of San Pedro, Santa Barbara, and Mon- terey ; but as the weather was boisterous
            and attended with rain, I did not land. On the evening of the 2Tth we reached San
            Francisco. To give an account of this wonderful city which has sprung into existence in
            the last four years, and whose rapid growth and extraordinary prosperity have astonished
            the world, is not my intention. No city on the face of the globe has ever attained the
            position that San Francisco has in the same period ; and it is yet progressing. It is
            now almost the first in population on the western coast of the American continent ; and
            but a few years will elapse before it will surpass all the rest. In point of commerce,
            the great ports of Europe and on the Atlantic coast of the United States alone, can vie
            with it. As the outlet of the principal and almost only rivers of California, it will
            continue to bear the same relation to the interior as New Orleans and New York do to the
            United States east of the Piocky Mountains. The harbor of San Francisco is one of the
            most spacious in the world, easy of access, of a conve- nient depth for anchorage, and
            protected from storms. The city itself now presents a strange medley of build- ings,
            from the rudest hovel and canvas tent to the ele- NAPA VALLEY. . 9 gant mansion and the
            most substantial wareTiouses. The former, however, are rapidly giving way to the latter
            ; and now that bricks of a superior quality are made here, and excellent building stone
            is found near at hand, no one will' think of putting up wooden build- ings within the
            city. In the streets of San Francisco all is bustle and confusion. Crowds are constantly
            passing and repassing. The wharves are thickly lined with magnifi- cent ships from every
            quarter of the globe, pouring in their thousands of immigrants, and discharging their
            valuable cargoes. The ocean steamers, each bearing from five hundred to one thousand
            passengers, are weekly arriving ; while the river boats, which take their daily
            departure for the interior every morning and evening, present the same moving crowds
            going and coming as the Hudson River boats at New York. All go full ; and one is as much
            puzzled to find a spare seat or stool on which to rest his weary limbs, as on board the
            excur- sion boats from our Atlantic cities. The stages and other means of conveyance are
            equally crowded. The throng moves to and fro, from the city to the mines and the
            interior, and thence back again to the city. Go to the business streets, and the
            auctioneer's hammer is heard at every turn, knocking off to the anxious bidder every
            article of commerce. Stocks, gold mines, ships, whole cargoes of merchandise, are bought
            and sold with the same freedom as in the Royal Exchange of London, the Bourse of Paris,
            or in Wall-street, New York. There are customers for every thing, and an abundance of
            gold to meet any purchase however large. There is no project too great for the
            Californian of the present day. He is ready for any undertaking, whether • 10 SAN DIEGO
            TO it be to make a railroad to the Atlantic, to swallow up Mexico, or invade the empire
            of Japan. New York is now the first city on the American continent, and San Francisco is
            destined ere long to be second. San Francisco is said to have obtained its name in the
            following manner: "When Father Juniper Serra " received his orders from the
            Yisitant-general respecting the names which he was to give to the new missions in
            California, he observed that the name of the founder of their order was not among them,
            and called the at- tention of his superior to the fact, exclaiming, "Is not our Father
            San Francisco to have a mission ? " to which the Visitant-general replied, " If San
            Francisco desires a mission, let him show jou a port, and he shall Iiave it." In the
            year 1769 an expedition was dis- patched from San Diego, for the purpose of settling
            Monterey. The expedition missed the port, but dis- .covered a much larger and finer bay
            further to the .jiorth, which had been till then unknown. The com- mander of the
            expedition and his religious associates .decided that this discovery must be the work of
            St. JFrancis, and accordingly they gave his name to the place, setting up a cross, and

            wants of the zealous priests who colonized California in the year 1770 and the Americans

            Palou. VidadeFray JuniperoSerra, p. 102 sovereiOT 12 SAN DIEGO TO For three weeks after
            I arrived in San Francisco it rained incessantly, confining me most of the time to the
            honse. The result was a great rise in the rivers, so that the mining regions were laid
            under water, and became impassable. The Sacramento was so swollen as to inundate the
            city of the same name. This state of things prevented me from visiting the interior, and
            particularly the gold region. Having a couple of weeks still to spare before our camp
            equipage would be ready, I determined to avail myself of this brief space in visiting
            some of the many interesting objects in which California abounds. To examine the gold
            mines in so short a time with any satisfaction, seemed impracticable. I therefore
            concluded to visit some localities whick were less known, and which would be Ity than
            the gold region, with which I already felt pretty well acquainted through the daily
            accounts of them in the newspapers. I had heard an interesting description of some
            geysers and a volcanic region at the head of Napa Valley, which I determined to visit as
            soon as the travelling would permit. Accordingly I left San Francisco on the 17th of
            March, accompanied by Dr. Webb and Mr. Thurber, for Benicia, where we arrived in two
            hours. Our steamer was crowded with passengers, chiefly bound for the mines, among whom
            were a number of Chinese. These men were dressed in their native costume, and each
            carried with him a huge pair of, boots, showing plainly to what region he was destined.
            Benicia was for a while the rival of San Francisco ; though I cannot see why such
            aspirations should have been indulged in for a moment. It is situated on the NAPA
            VALLEY. . 13 o Straits of Carquinez, alDOut thirty miles from San Fran- cisco, on a
            gentle slope, which becomes almost a plain as it approaches the water's edge. It
            contained at the time of my visit about 1500 inhabitants, including the soldiers now
            stationed here. Its buildings are mostly of wood, and among these are several hotels.
            The best of them is the "American," a neat and well-kept house, where we stopped. . It
            was then the Head-quarters of the Pacific division of the U. S. Army. The la deposit of
            Quarter-master's and Commissary's stor,es had been recently removed hither, and efforts
            were making to have the Navy yard here also. The Pacific Mail Steam Ship Company had its
            depot here, and next to the Navy yard was the most valuable accession it could possibly
            enjoy. The steamers all lie here until a few days before sailing, when they move down to
            San Francisco. This company furnished much business to the place with its large coal
            depot, ship yard, and various workshops, where several hundred men were constantly
            employed. The military post is about a mile from the town, and consists of a few wooden
            build- mgs. I called on General Hitchcock, commanding the Pacific division of the U. S.
            Army, for the purpose of obtaining an escort for the Commission from San Diego to the
            Pimo villages on the Gila. This seemed neces- sary, as the command of Colonel Craig
            amounting to twenty-five men, which accompanied the surveying parties down the Gila, had
            all deserted but five, on their arrival at San Diego ; and of these, three were
            non-commissione.d officers. General Hitchcock, with the promptness and liberality which
            have ever distin- 14 SAN DIEGO TO uished liim, at once acceded to my request, and gave
            me an order on the commanding officers at San Diego and Fort Yuma to furnisli me with
            such a force as they deemed necessary. It was from Benicia that we were to take the road
            to Napa Yalley. On making known to General Hitch- cock my desire to visit the Geysers,
            he kindly furnished me with horses and a pack-mule for the purpose. To Major Allen, the
            Quarter-master, I am also indebted for his promptness in facilitating the wishes of
            myself and party in our proposed trip, and for sending me a trusty man. March Idth. Our
            horses, mule, and attendant were promptly at the door by 7 o'clock ; and after break-
            fast we took our departure. Proceeding along the shores of the bay, we passed the great
            projected city of Vallejo, the once intended capital of the State. It now stands naked
            and alone, its large houses tenant- less. As the capital of California it might have
            become a place of importance ; but without such factitious aid there is nothing to build
            it. Here we entercfl Napa Valley. The hills on both sides as well as the valley were
            covered with a luxu- riant growth of wild oats, and immense herds of cattle were roaming
            about feasting on them. Wild flowers of varied hues were thickly scattered around, and
            every thing showed that the heavy and continued rains had given new life to vegetation.
            Our course was now a northerly one, directly up the valley. Napa Creek, which we saw at
            a distance, makes up it, and affords sufficient water for small vessels, several of
            which we saw gliding up. The valley soon became perfectly NAPA VALLEY. 15 level, without
            a hill or depression. In many places ploughmen were at work turning up the soil, which
            was of the richest description. Barley appeared to be the principal grain sowed, this
            being in more general use for horses than oats, and found to give a better yield. Iii
            one place I noticed a hill, the whole of which had been sowed with barley, presenting a
            field of more than a hundred acres. The soil here was loose ; and as the water had run
            off, the ground was in a fit state for cultivation. The valley below was still very wet,
            and would not be in a fit state to plough for weeks yet. On this account, the
            declivities possess an advan- tage for early planting, over the level plains. At 2
            o'clock reached the village of Napa, where we dined- Distance travelled, twenty miles.
            The road was excellent, except in two places, where the valley was still wet, and where
            our horses sank deep in the mud. Napa Creek is navigable to this point, even for vessels
            of a large burden, should it be neces- sary to bring them here, which will hardly be the
            case. Near the town is the hulk of a ship. It was bought by a gentleman in San Francisco
            for a trifle and brought here, where it is used as a storeship, as well as for the
            residence of the owner and his family. She cost much less than it would have done to
            erect a small dwelling, and the owner has besides the advantage of a large warehouse.
            She lay close by the river's bank ; and with a doorway cut in her side, the entrance was
            made quite easy. A steamboat now runs to San Fran- cisco, which will tend to populate
            rapidly this beautiful valley, and render the town of Napa the centre of one of the
            richest agricultural districts in the State. After 16 SAN DIEGO TO \ dinner we rode five
            miles, to tlie house of Joseph "VV. Osborne, Esq., a merchant of San Francisco, who had
            invited me to make him a visit. Mr. 0. had pre- w ceded us a couple of days, and met us
            at his gate, giving us a warm reception. Mr; Osborne's place was the most beautiful and
            picturesque I had seen in the valley. In fact, it was the only house wherein there was
            any attempt at taste and comfort ; for the country was too new to expect much in this
            way yet. But even his was a small and unpretending cottage after the New England
            fashion. The valley here is about four miles in width. Where it opens on St. Pablo Bay
            it is about six miles, but it gradually contracts towards the north. At the entrance it
            is an open plain, destitute of trees, and covered with luxuriant grass; but here it
            assumes a new aspect, such a one, too, as I had not before seen in the coun- try. It is
            now studded with gigantic oaks, some of them evergreen, though not so close together as
            to render it necessary to cut any away to prepare the land for cultivation. These
            magnificent oaks are found sometimes in long lines, and again in clusters of twenty or
            thirty, forming beautiful groves ; then again a space of ten or twenty acres will occur
            without a single tree. If this romantic valley were transferred to the older countries
            of Europe, it would be taken for the domain of a prince or a nobleman. It answers to the
            idea one has of the old and highly cultivated parks of England, where taste and money
            have been lavished with an unsparing hand, through many generations. As one emerges from
            or enters each grove, he involuntarily expects some venerable castle or mansion to
            appear; ft i ? NAPA VALLEY. 17 or to find himself among some secluded villages. But in
            the entire length of the valley there are no houses to be found within a less distance
            than five miles of each other, and these too of the most humble and unpretending
            character. What is singular, and to me unaccountable in these groves of large trees is,
            that there are no young ones, none but the venerable and full-grown oaks, which,
            doubtless, for centuries have held exclusive sway over this wide-spread and beauti- ful
            domain. Nor is there any undergrowth of other trees and shrubs. I can only account for
            this defi- ciency by attributing it to fires since the occupation of the country by the
            Spaniards ; or, by supposing that the immense herds of cattle, which for a century past
            have occupied the valley, have browsed upon the shrubs and young trees, until they
            destroyed them, and afterwards kept down the shoots as they sprang up. The valley is
            hemmed in on both sides by ranges of loAv mountains, running north and south, which are
            generally covered ' to their very summits with forest trees. Here and there bold rocks
            jut out, presenting the most fantastic outlines ; while between the valley and the
            mountains runs a lower range of rounded hills, dotted with small bushy oaks and pines,
            which present a fine contrast with the more sombre hues of the mountain foliage.
            Occasionally the gigantic j)aIo Colorado (red wood) raises its tall head far above every
            other object, making even the huge oaks appear diminutive. In the midst of the valley
            winds a small stream, called Napa Creek, its course marked by the graceful VOL. II. 2 \
            18 SAN DIEGO TO willows that grow along its margin. This creek is chiefly supplied by
            springs near the head of the valley ; but during the rainy season several mountain
            torrents empty their waters into it — indeed, some of them I was told contribute a
            portion during the whole year. The larger portion of Napa Valley was still in the state
            in which nature had left it, but had all been taken up by recent settlers, and was fast
            being brought into cultivation. A road had just been laid out through its centre, and
            every farmer was occupied in marking out his land and dividing it into lots inclosed
            substantial rail fences. Ploughs were cutting up the virgin sward in all directions ;
            and in one place I saw a ditching machine in operation. It answered the double purpose
            of making a ditch four or five feet wide, with an embankment of sufficient height to
            answer for a fence or wall. This machine was worked by two or three oxen and a windlass.
            It is a rapid Tnethod of accomplishing two most important objects ; ;and the mound is
            said to keep the cattle out as well as .a high fence. Mr. Osborne's men were all New
            England farmers, several of them from Ithode Island ; and it is astonish- ing to see how
            much more work one of these men will perform than a Mexican or Californiau. He pays them
            .seventy-five dollars a month, and finds them, which pays him better than employing
            ordinary hands at half the price. Mr. 0. has owned this property but one year; and a
            furrow was never turned on it or a ■seed sown, until he came into possession. He has now
            more than a hundred acres under cultivation, a con- .siderable portion of which is
            protected by a post and NAPA VALLEY. 19 rail fence of red wood. Many fruit trees, grape
            vines, flowering shrubs, etc., are in a fiourisliing condition around his house. In no
            part of the Atlantic States or Mississippi Valley could such improvements be shown in
            the same time, except on prairie land. March 20th. This morning we called on Mr. Yaunt,
            a Missourian, and one of the oldest settlers in the valley. Mr. Y. came here some twelve
            or fifteen years ago, and obtained a large grant of land from the Government ; he,
            however, has cultivated very little of it, but has used it, like the other great land-
            holders of the country, for a cattle range. The other original grantees of land in Napa
            Valley were Mr. Fowler, Dr. Bale, an Englishman, and Don Salvador Vallejo. The usual
            measure of land in this country, as well as in Mexico, is the square league, containing
            about five thousand acres. SeSor Vallejo, who was the largest proprietor here, owned six
            square leagues, or thirty thousand acres. It is well for the country that these large
            estates are now being divided and brought into market. They will, doubtless, ere long be
            eagerly sought after, on account of their extraordi- nary fertility and beautiful
            situation, by gentlemen who wish to get away from the bustle of a great city, and enjoy
            the retirement of a country life. I was desirous to have Mr. Yaunt accompany ns * In an

            Indians, and actually bound to the stake. He had been a hunter and a trapper, and Indian
            fighter at large, in the heart of the continent, until 20 SAN DIEGO TO to the Geysers,
            and he readily promised to go ; but as he did not appear at the time appointed, we
            waited for him till twelve o'clock, and then determined to proceed without him. Mr.
            Osborne now joined our party, and we resumed our journey. The valley continued as
            before, level, and without t his combative propensities were gratified — and lie finally
            found himself one day at the " jumplng-off place" and made his first attempt at ocean
            navigation on the bosom of the broad Pacific- In the unpretending skiff of an otter
            hunter, often unaccompanied save by his trusty rifle, he f coasted the shores and
            islands of California in search of the pelt of his valuable prey. While employed one day
            (in the year 1836) in his regular pursuit, he chanced to steer his skiff into the
            navigable creek or ■f fr estuary of Napa, rightly judging it a place of resort for his
            furry friends. The valley was then inhabited by none but Indians; and he made his way up
            to a beautiful spot, a few miles from his boat, which had been selected for a rancheria
            by a tribe called the " Caymas." Here he sat ; down to rest; when suddenly there flashed
            upon his mind, like a gleam ; of light, a long-forgotten prophecy of an old fortune
            teller in his native 1 State. He declares that the sibyl had predicted the spot of his
            future ? residence in terms exactly answering to the description of this valley, in-
            cluding all the accessories of grove, plain, mountain, river, and even " me- ; dicine
            water," as the Indians call the springs. The old man pondered over this prophecy,
            counted his gains, which had been considerable, and f philosophized over the
            vicissitudes of human life, not forgetting, how- ever, to examine the valley more
            carefully. On his next visit to Monterey, he became a citizen of California, and
            obtained a grant of land, embracing the charmed spot indicated by the Western witch. He
            then came and settled it, purchasing cattle with his gains in the " lower country." But
            the happy valley then swarmed with Indians, jealous of white men, and constantly
            fighting among themselves ; so that this elysium was turned into a pandemonium by then*
            screams and war- whoops. He quitted his skiff, formed an alliance offensive and defen-
            sive, with the rancheria of Caymas, erected a log house, after the man- ner of his
            ancestors in the days of Daniel Boone, and with his faithful rifle — the only fire-arm
            in the valley — not only stood and repelled the I f I NAPA VALLEY. 21 a hill or an

            conspicuous, raising its tall stem far above the others. * \ attacks of the rival
            rancherias, but attacking in turn, exterminated the unruly, sustained the wavering, and,
            single-handed, bullied the whole valley into submission. Many a weary, and anxious, and
            watchful night did he spend ere this result was achieved ; but once accomplished, his
            sovereignty remained undisputed; the conquered became his servants; and the allies of
            Caymus remain to this day his laborers and his farm hands." — Tour in California p. 95.
            This tree is remarkable for the great height which it attains. I have been told by
            credible persons that specimens are now growing which are three hundred feet in height ;
            and I have seen pei*sons who have mea- sured fallen trunks two hundred and sixty-six
            feet in length. It is one of the most important vegetable productions of California ;
            and besides the rarious uses to which it is applied Avhen sawed into boards, it is
            exten- sively employed for fencing purposes, the grain being so straight that it splits
            with the greatest ease ; indeed, before the introduction of saw- mills, it was usual to
            split logs of the red wood into planks. It is also said to be very durable. Colonel
            Fremont saw posts which had been in the ground three fourths of a century, without
            traces of decay. The houses built by the Russians at Bodega many years since, are of
            this timber, with posts sunk in the ground, into which the horizontal pieces are
            mortised. The planks upon the sides are about three inches thick, and had been but
            little smoothed off after being split. No signs of decay could be detected even in the
            posts. At this place, Captain Smith erected a steam, grist, and saw-mill, in 1845, being
            the first structure of the kind in the country. He states that they could not saw logs
            much over four feet in diameter, and never cut any less than eighteen inches ; and yet
            the average number of cuts or logs, each of sixteen feet in length from a single tree,
            was between eight and ten.* • Report of P. T. Tjson to the Secretary of War, on the

            seventh of an acre, which was esti- mated to contain about an average of the forests of
            that region, and found within it three trees about one hundred feet high and eighteen
            inches thick, and twelve others varying between four and eight feet in diameter, and
            from 180 to 230 feet high " It is difficult to form an idea of the product of timber
            upon an acre containing the proportion within tbe fractional part above noted, without
            an arithmetical calcula- tion, when it will be found to produce about one million feet
            of boards, one inch thick, besides five hundred cords of wood from the tops and limbs-

            saw many acres which would yield considerably more in proportion than the measured
            space. Judge Thornton speaks of pines which " measured, at a height of be- tween six and
            a dozen feet above the ground, forty feet in circumference, their bark nearly a foot

            fell under his observation : "The big trees (for there are 131 of them over ten feet in

            here. This lady has a large estate, which contains more improvements than any about
            thirty miles north of Sonora, in Calaveras county. The iftam- moth tree which has been
            felled, wa Lored down with long augers, and took four men twenty-two days to get it
            down. The stump stands about six feet above tlie level of the ground, and its to) has
            been made level and smooth, which required sixteen days wort. I measured it from the
            inside of the bark across to the inside of the bark, and it measured twen- ty-five feet,
            and is perfectly sound clear to the heart. The bark, to the height of 52 feet, has been
            taken from the trunk in sections, and sent to the fair at New- York. If th top half of
            the tree were taken off, so as to make a level surfece, a stage coach with four horses
            might be driven on it, from the butt towards the tip, a distance of 166 feet, it being
            at this length ten feet in diameter. At the length of 280 feet, it is four feet in
            diameter. At this point it was broken off in foiling, and the tip was broken into
            fragments so fine I could not measure them ; but its height had been taken before it was
            felled, and set down at 300 feet It is called arhor vitce; but it is not fully decided
            to what variety it belongs. It is a little curious that no other trees of the same kind
            can be found less than seven feet in diameter, and this tree is estimated by a
            scientific gentleman from San Francisco to be 3,100 years old. "There are many others
            still standing, of the same kind, which are monsters ; some even larger than this, but
            not sound. One, called Un- cle Tom's Cabin, has a more commodious room in it than many
            miners' cabins. There are some large ones blown down, and one I must not fail to
            describe. It was evidently decayed before it fell, and in its fall broke off sixty feet
            from the roots. This part is hollow; and I cannot give you a better idea of its size,
            than by telling you that I rode my horse through it from end to end. At the end where it
            is broken off, the shell is very thin, and as I sat on the horse, I could not reach my
            hand to the inner surface, over my head ; but half-way through, the bhell was as much as
            three feet thick over my head, and more than that under the horse's feet, and here it
            was necessary to lean forward. But this is not the larirest. There is another one blown
            down, which raeas- ures 110 feet in circumference and 410 feet in length; Tliis, too, is
            hollow ; and if the hollow were enlarged a little, it would mate a very good ropo-
            walk." 24 SAN DIEGO TO other farm in the valley. In her orchard I noticed pear and peach
            trees, and grape vines in abundance ; while around the house were rose bushes and other
            flowering shrubs. The lady was at work in her gar- den, in which she seemed to take a
            deep interest ; while frolicking around her were six beautiful chil- dren, whose light
            hair and fair complexion indicated their Anglo-Saxon parentage. Passed other farms, some
            of which, particularly Mr. Keller's, bore the marks of an old settlement, from the
            extent of its fences, its barns, saw-mill, and other improvements. Here was a large
            orchard of peach trees in full bloom ; which trees, I was told, were brought round Cape
            Horn from the Atlantic States. Every thing here was in a flourishing condition ;
            although in the form and arrangement of the buildings a sad deficiency of taste was
            visible. A ride of three miles further brous'ht us to Mr 1 o Kilburn's, a Missourian,
            with a Californian wife. We stopped here for the night, and were disappointed in not
            finding Mr. K. at home. He is another old resi- dent, having been some seven years in
            the valley. As this gentleman was familiar with the district we were about to visit, we
            had relied on his accompanying ns ; or, failing to do so, we had hoped to obtain such
            infor- mation from him as would enable us to find the objects of which we were in
            search. Mrs. Kilburn received us kindly, although we were all strangers to her;
            nevertheless she seemed a little flustered when we told her we had come to pass the
            night there. She is quite young, good-looking, and has an interesting family of little
            ones around her, who, like the children before NAPA VALLEY. 25 ■ mentioned, exhibit
            their Anglo-Saxon descent. A fine supper was soon prepared for us ; after partaking of
            which, we were directed to our beds in the chamber above, all clean and comfortable. *
            The valley for the last few miles had diminished much in width, being not moi than a
            mile at Mr. Kil- burn's farm. The soil, too, had changed from a black loam to claj and
            gravel. Nevertheless, vegetation seemed quite as luxuriant, and the valley presented a
            greater variety of trees. The oak, which, as I have stated, monopolizes the valley
            below, here gives way to the lofty pine, spruce, red-wood, cedar, etc. I had heard at San
            Francisco of the large yield of vegetables on this farm, and made inquiry as to its
            truth. I found the statement to be correct ; .and that from two acres of onions planted
            near the house, Mr. Kilburn had realized last year, in the market of San Francisco,
            eight thousand dollars in cash. He also raised an immense number of cabbages and other
            vege- tables. In explanation of this, I ought to mention that onions are considered the
            most valuable of all vege- tables among the gold miners, on account of their anti-
            scorbutic properties. They grow here to an enormous size, and give an immense yield. My
            own experience convinces me of the great value of onions where there is a predisposition
            to scurvy, and there is no vegetable which one craves more than this. Many have I bought
            at twelve and a half cents a piece, and eaten with more relish than I ever did an
            orange. In our ride to-day, we crossed the valley to examine some thermal springs, which
            are somewhat celebrated here. They are in a plain near the base of a small hill i 26 SAN
            DIEGO TO NAPA VALLEY 1 of conglomerate rock ; but owing to the wet and boggy condition
            of the valley, we were unable to approach within thirty feet of them. Columns of steam .
            were rising from them on all sides. These springs had been visited by Professor Shepard
            the year'before, and some The Pro- account of them given *by him to the public*
            temperature is said to be constantly changing, fessor S. heard that there was a place
            near the foot of Mount Helena, where the hot waters formerly flowed, but which had now
            ceased. This report induced* him to visit the spot. " Externally," he says, " there was
            no uncommon appearance to indicate the locality. Neither a surplus or a scarcity of
            vegetation, and no appearance of scoria, tufa or travertine, as might have been
            expected." In one place, however, he found it slightly warm on the surface ; and on
            excavating to the depth of two feet, it became so hot that he could not bear his hand in
            the mud and clay. He inserted the bulb of his thermometer, and the mercury at once rose
            to one hundred and twenty degrees. The tem- perature of the springs we visited, varied
            from 105 to 169 degrees. See Silliman's Journal, Nov. 1851, p. 154 THE GEYSERS Of TLUTOX

            journey after breakfast; and at Mr. Fowler's, three or four miles distant, met a man who
            manifested much curiosity in our researches, when he found us inquiring about mines and
            the vol- canic region. He showed Dr. Webb a specimen of ore, which, he said, was from
            that vicinity. The doc- tor at once pronounced it zinc, and expressed a doubt about its
            being found in the state in which it was exhibited to him. But the man insisted that,
            his account of its origin was correct, and furthermore offered to conduct us to the spot
            ; whereupon we set off together under his guidance. Crossing the valley to the opposite
            side, he led us up a deep ravine,, where he leaped from his horse and pointed out the
            rock from V 28 THE GEYSERS OF PLUTON RIVER, which he said the specimen was taken. An
            examina- tion showed it to be nothing but serpentine. He led the doctor to several
            ledges at some distance, but their character was the same. He had evidently been im-
            posed upon, for he acknowledged afterwards that he did not find the specimen himself.

            of the valley loomed up Mount Helena or Moyacino of the Russians. This is the highest
            moun- tain fora great distance around, none within seventy or eighty miles having as
            great an altitude. On its summit is an inscription in Russian- characters on a plate of
            copper, giving the latitude and longitude of the place. We met several persons who had
            seen the tablet. The Russians had a settlement called Fort Rosse on Bodega Bay, opposite
            this mountain ; and the tablet was doubtless placed there to show the line of boundary
            which Russia claimed. The view here exhibited the finest alpine scenery I had yet seen
            in California, and showed that we were advancing northward as well as reaching a higher
            elevation. Reached Mr. JCnight's, twelve miles from Kilburn's, at noon. Here the valley
            grew quite narrow, or rather terminated, it being intersected by a range of hills. At
            this place, another valley opened some two or three miles in width, and extended about
            ten miles farther to the north. i I, t T i ■ i While this man was hunting up his

            AND RETURN TO SAN FRANCISCO. 29 Mr. Knight is a young man from Vermont, who came across
            the continent about seven years before our visit, with the first emigrants to Oregon. As
            the country did not suit him, he pushed his. way south- ward, until he struck this
            valley. He owns a large tract of land here ; but in consequence of his distance from
            market, he has, very wisely, turned his attention from cultivating the soil, to that of
            raising stock. His isolated position, and the hills of grass and wild oats which
            surround him on everv side, render it a most advantageous one for this purpose. Although
            sur- rounded by wild beasts and warlike Indians, and with no neighbor within twelve
            miles of him, he had not forgotten all the enjoyments that belong to civilized
            communities, as was evinced by a piano-forte and a case well filled with books. An
            Indian village stood a few hundred yards from the house ; and at my request Mr. Knight
            went out and brought me three of the most intelligent among them, from whom I obtained a
            full vocabulary of their F language. Like many other tribes of the country, nd of this
            region in particular, they appeared to have no name for themselves as a people. By the
            white peo- e, these and all other Indians between the Sacra- mento and the coast," and
            thence through the central parts of the State, are called "Diggers," or ''Digger
            Indians," from the fact that they live chiefly on roots, which they collect by digging.
            I therefore set them down as Indians of Napa Valley. We had met with several small
            bands, and passed a few villages on our way up ; but from none could I learn that they
            had any name for their tribe. This fact will account for 30 THE GEYSERS OF PLUTON RIVER,
            the great diversity in the names of the California Indians as given by travellers. In
            examining the various books on this country and articles in scientific journals, I -fiad
            tribes mentioned by names which are not elsewhere to be found; and in my own inquiries I
            have found tribes who called themselves by names which I never heard of before. This has
            induced me to believe that the small tribes or bands, which abound here more than in any
            other part of North America, when asked to what tribe they belong, give the name of
            their chief, which is misunderstood by the inquirer to be that of the tribe itself.
            Their houses are circular, and from twelve to thirty feet in diameter, the interior
            usually excavated about three feet below the surface of the ground. Within this circle
            posts are planted, forked at the top, upon which rest poles reaching from one to the
            other. The spaces between the posts are filled in with sticks or tules, against which
            the earth is 'firmly banked up outside. The roofs are dome-shaped, and, in the smaller
            houses, supported by a single post in the cen- tre, on the forked top of which rest two
            main rafters, with their outer ends planted in the ground. From these are stretched
            stout poles, about a foot apart and thatched with sticks and tules, or rushes closely
            inter- woven, and covered with a solidly pressed layer of earth about a foot thick,
            making a roof completely water proof in the heaviest rains. In some villi tlie houses
            have but one aperture, which is on the top of the roof, and serves for both door and
            chimney. This is entered by a sort of rude ladder, or by notches cut in the centre-post.

            California Indians differ from all others. I allude to their beards, which are generally
            permitted to grow. It is true they are not as thick and bushy as in the white race, but
            'short, thin, and stiff. I have never seen them extend beyond the upper lip and the
            chin. The hair of all the Cali- fornia Indians I have seen is cut short. x\fter
            partaking of an excellent dinner, we took leave of our host. " For several miles our
            journey ex- tended over a plain hemmed in on all sides, on which large herds of cattle
            were grazing ; then came ranges of low hills, all covered with wild oats or clover. The
            cattle truly luxuriated here. A ride of twelve miles, alternately over low hills and
            valleys, and windin through clusters of trees and shrubbery, brought us to the
            establishment of MacDonald, the last settler in this part of the country, towards
            Oregon. We received a cordial welcome from Mr. MacDonald and his wife, a young woman of
            twenty, who must have some cou- rage to settle down in this lonely spot. On making known
            my intention to visit the volcanic region, Mr. MacDonald consented to be our guide,
            although busily engaged in putting in his crops. Having an hour or two to spare before
            dark, I took a sketch of the valley and adjoining mountains, all of which presented a
            most picturesque appearance. The valley is here very limited, being confined to o AND
            RETURN TO SAN FRANCISCO. ■ 35 . patches of from twenty to fifty acres, but all connected
            by a small and never-failing stream of excellent water. The object of our friend in
            settling here was to secure to himself a large tract of land without encroachment. Thus
            he has a section of good tillable land of one hun- dred and sixty to two hundred acres,
            and on the low hills around it about four thousand acres excellent for grazing purposes.
            Having secured all the valley, no one would take up land on the hills. His section
            would, therefore, give him the use of the large tract adjacent, which was all he
            required. March 22(i. Took an early breakfast, and started at seven o'clock. MacDonald
            led the way, and we followed him in Indian file. We had now no more F beautiful valleys
            or grassy plains to traverse. Nothing but a succession of lofty and rugged mountains lay
            before us, through the intricacies of which we had to wind our way. There was no road,
            nor even a trail, save those made by wild animals, of which there was an abundance in
            these parts. Our guide often directed our attention to the huge tracks of the grizzly
            and brown bear, and again to those of the elk, which con- stantly crossed and recrossed
            our path. He had been several times to the place we were going, and knew the country
            well ; yet so wild and rugged was it, so dense the forest, and with such a succession of
            ascents and descents, that he sometimes seemed at a loss which way to go. The general
            direction was well known ; but among such a number of deep gorges and ravines,
            mountains, hills, and valleys, it was no easy task to select the right one ; and a
            mistake in the mazes of such a place would leads us into inextricable diflSculties. 36
            THE GEYSERS OF PLUTOX RIYER, • At noon, having been five hours in the saddle, we stopped
            to rest ourselves, as well as our animals, on one of the elevated spurs, from which we
            had a grand view of a vast stretch of country towards the coast. Some ten or fifteen
            miles distant lay E-ussIan River, winding its way along a beautiful valley, bounded by a
            succession of hills ; and beyond this rose the coast range of mountains. While the
            animals were grazing, I took a sketch of this enchanting spot. Pursuing our journey

            throw horse and rider some hundred feet below, and now leading our frightened animals up
            some precipitous ascent where it was unsafe to ride them, we at length reached the
            summit of the mountain beyond. From this elevated point the view was grand beyond
            description. On the east, far in the distance, the horizon was bouiided by the
            snow-capped summits of the Sierra Nevada, form- ing a well marked line with the deep
            blue of the ho- rizon. Nearer, and on every side, lay mountains of every variety of form
            ; some rugged and bare,' others covered with a deep Alpine foliage, while others again
            of less height, from their yellow hue, seemed clothed with the rich verdure of wild
            oats. Four or five miles distant, in an opening surrounded by rugged mountains, lay
            Clear Lake. After following the summit we were now on, for a couple of miles, we began
            to descend again into the deep gorge, through which runs Pluton Kiver, on whose banks
            are the volcanic phenomena and geysers of AND RETURN TO SAN FRANCISCO. 37 which we were
            in search. The descent was here so steep that we were obliged to dismount from., our
            ani- mals and lead them down. Our progress was now necessarily rapid, and we soon
            reached the base of the mountain. Here we suddenly came upon four men, who had come out
            a few days before us from MacDo- nald's to amuse themselves in hunting the grizzly bear.
            We reached this place at four o'clock, a distance of but sixteen miles, after a most
            fatiguing journey ; although the beauty and variety of the scenery well repaid us for
            the effort. As there was still a descent of five hundred feet to the stream, and a mile
            to the geysers, we determined to leave their examination till morning, and devote the
            remainder of the day to rest and the preparation of our dinner. As the hunters had
            nothing but bear's' meat in store, three of them took their rifles and went out to
            procure a deer for dinner. In less than an hour all returned, each bringing with him the
            hind quarters of a fine deer, having been equally successful in their short hunt. While
            they were absent, our servant had made a fire, and got a kettle of boiling water ready
            for making coffee. In ten minutes after their return, the venison and bear's meat were
            roasting before the fire, and emitting the most appetizing odors. The method of
            preparing a fine game dinner with- out a single cooking utensil deserves to be
            mentioned. First, a number of sticks are cut about two feet in length, the size of one's
            finger, divested of their bark, and sharpened at one end. These correspond to the spits
            in civilized roast-ovens. The meat is now cut up into pieces about three quarters of an
            inch in thickness * ' 38 THE GEYSERS OP PLUTON RIVER, and half the size of one's hand,
            with a hole in the cen- tre. Through these the sharpened stick is thrust, and its lower
            end planted in the ground before the fire. As our fare consisted of venison and bear's
            meat, suc- cessive layers of each were put upon the sticks, the fat of the latter, as it
            dripped down, basting and furnish- ing an excellent gravy to the former. In fifteen
            minutes, with occasional turning, the dinner was pro- nounced ready to be served up.
            Being unprovided with the luxury of a table, we seated ourselves on the grass, beneath
            the wide-spread- ing boughs of a tree, and a few yards from the fire, in order to be
            near the kitchen, and to have our meats and cofiee warm. Before each person was stuck in
            the ground a stick of the roasted meat. A bag of hard bread (pilot bread), some sugar,
            salt, and pepper, were placed near, and each man was provided with a tin cup filled with
            coffee. Thus furnished, and with sharp appetites, we fell to, and never was a feast more
            heartily appreciated. Our coffee and bread were excellent; and those who were not
            satisfied with one stick of meat, found another ready at the fire when the first was
            gone. By the time we had finished our dinner, it was dark. We then sat for an hour or
            two listening to the feats and adventures related to us by the hunters before referred
            to, all of which were exciting: and full of interest ; after which, one by one, we
            rolled ourselves in our blankets, and dropped asleep, dreaming of grizzly bears, elk,
            venison, and the wild scenery we had been enjoying during the day. March 23c?. Was up by
            sunrise, after an excellent AND RETURN TO SAN FRANCISCO. 39 nighf s rest ; and took a
            bath in the waters of a little 9 stream that tumbled down within twenty feet of our
            cainp-fire, by which time our breakfast was ready. This was a counterpart of yesterday's
            dinner, viz., bear's meat, venison, hard-bread, and coffee. Having dispatched it, we set
            off for the geysers : Dr. "Webb, with his hummer and leather has for minerals, and with
            boxes and bottles for small zoological specimens ; Mr. Thurber, with his portfolio for
            plants ; and I, with my sketch-book. We were all provided with pistols or rifles
            besides. It would have been easier and attended with less risk, to make the descent on
            foot ; but we were obliged to go on horseback, on account of having to ford the stream.
            The river or creek was from thirty to 'forty feet wide where we crossed it, about half
            up the horse's middle, and very rapid. On either side, the banks were rocky and steep,
            rendering it some- what difficult, though with steady animals not a dan- gerous,
            passage. About a quarter of a mile' from the opposite bank we dismounted, unsaddled our
            animals, and staked them out to feast themselves on the rich clover which there
            abounded, and then completed our journey on foot. A few hundred yards brought us to the
            first of the geysers, or " volcanoes," as they were called by our guide. I should not
            forget to remark, that we saw in several ravines, as we passed along, traces of former
            volcanic action. The rocks were bare, and in a decomposed state, showing the eSects of
            heat or fire, although no heat was then perceptible. At the first place we stopped,
            there was a show of about half an acre of decomposed granite, and othef rocks, from
            cavities in which issued fumes of sulphur 40 THE GEYSERS OF PLUTON RIVER, t t and small
            quantities of steam. At these places were beds of. crystallized sulphur; and in others,
            sulphur was exposed on turning up with a stick the exterior crust. There was every
            appearance around us that the rocks had been subjected to an intense heat, 'which was
            now gradually abating. After collecting specimens of the sulphur and adjacent rocks, we
            continued further i up. Another quarter of a mile, over steep hills and across deep
            ravines, brought us to the principal "geysers." Here was truly a grand prospect, and
            diihcult to de- scribe by one unacquainted with such scenes ; for to speak with
            scientific precision of such a remarkable spot as this, the writer should be
            familiarwith volcanic regions and know something of similar phenomena. The action here
            was confined within a narrow ravine, in the moun- tain side, running nearly at right
            angles with Pluton River, which we had crossed. The banks were from . one hundred and
            twenty-five to one hundred and fifty feet in height, breaking in from the mountain,
            which rose up from ten to fifteen hundred feet above, and were wholly composed of
            decomposed rocks. In the chasm beneath us, columns of steam were spouting out on every
            side ; while deep at the bottom, ran a small rivulet. Vegetation of luxuriant growth
            crowded close upon the crumbling rocks, consisting of various kinds of shrubbery, pines,
            oaks, firs, etc. We clambered down to the spot where the scoria or burnt rock first
            appeared, and seated ourselves under the shade of a pine tree. From this point 1 took a
            sketch looking down the gorge. On each side of where we sat, some twenty or thirty feet
            below, a i U- AND RETURN TO SAN FRANCISCO. 41 small stream came tumbling down, concealed
            from view by dense foliage, and miited at the base of a jutting mass of rocks, as seen
            in the sketch. I thrust a staif, which I carried with me, some three or four feet into
            the crumbled granite beneath ; which led us to think it not quite safe to remain where
            we were. From this place, we got down with some difficulty to the bottom of the gorge,
            where the main stream ran. The water was here cold and pure, exhibiting no unpleasant
            taste. A few yards further brought us into the midst of the puffing geysers, or
            steam-jets ; for I knew not by what other name to call them. Fumes of sulphur here met
            our nostrils at every step, while the rustling steam, as it spouted from a hundred
            cavities, completely envel- oped us. The latter did not issue in one continuous column,
            but at short intervals, as from the 'pipe of a high pressure engine. It was with some
            difficulty that we could breathe here among the fumes of sulphur and the steam; and we
            crouched low in the bed of the rocky stream to avoid them. In cavities along both banks,
            and near the running brook, was boiling water, which rose and fell, accompanied by a
            loud gurgling noise, resembling that of a sriaantic steam condenser. C '-""'' " "- C3b
            In one of these cavities, stones as large as an egg were in a state of commotion,
            presenting a curious resemblance to a pot of boiling potatoes. I held my hand fifteen
            inches above this boiling pot, at. which distance the water scalded it. From this cavity
            to the 1 •unning stream, was just the width of my hand ; though the surface of the
            boiling water in the cavity, was about a foot above the running water. The whole of this
            violent commotion was accompanied by a tremendous 42 THE GEYSERS OF PLUTON RIVER, noise
            "beneath tlie earth's surface, quite equal to and resembling that made by several ocean
            steamers, letting off their steam through their large pipes, loud, deep, and harsh.
            There was no cessation to this awful roar, but one continued noise, as though a vast
            workshop beneath was in full operation. The banks of the sroro'e were now too steep to
            attempt to ascend, nor would it have been safe to do so among so many jets of
            steam,boiling caldrons, and fumes of sulphur ; so we made our way down the gorge in the
            very bed of the stream, jumping from rock to rock, first on one side and then on the
            other, and occasionally,where the stream took a leap, letting ourselves down in the best
            way we could. Thus we worked our way along for about an hour, filled' with admiration
            and wonder at the mysterious workings of nature around us. Tne water, as we advanced,
            grew warmer, in consequence of accessions from the boiling cavities along its mar- gin,
            until the stream became quite hot. We had here an opportunity to select a bath of any
            temperature, from one of icy coldness to that of one hundred and fifty degrees ; and we
            did not fail to improve it in some of the deeper basins of the stream, which seemed pre-
            pared by nature for such a purpose. Having thus refreshed ourselves, we clambered up the
            opposite bank ; and as we had now passed througli that portion of the gorge which had
            been affected by the heat, we lay down awhile under the shade of a tree on the bank of
            Pluton Kiver. Looking up here, saAV before us, at the distance of a few hundred yards,
            another of these volcanic wonders. This was directly on the north-east bank of the
            stream, and was AXD RETURN TO SAN FRANCISCO. 43 by a patch, of decomposed rock of a
            wliitish cast, cover- ing' about an acre. Here also jets of steam issued forth, but not
            in so many places, nor with as much force as within the gorge just described. Dr. Webb
            and Mr. Thurber examined it. and afterwards visited several others, further up the river
            ; but none of them were found to equal the first in grandeur. I remained be- hind with
            Mr. Osborne, to take a sketch from the bank where we stood, showing these last named
            geysers, and the deep mountain gorge through which Pluton River runs. The scenery here
            was truly grand. Im- mense pines grew on the mountain sides and tops, while oaks and
            smaller trees filled the narrow valleys and ravines, which the rains had made. Just
            below us ran the river, dashing over rocks in its steep descent, and often concealed by
            the thick foliage which over- hung it. Mr. Osborne and myself then returned and crossed
            the foot of the gorge where the great geysers are, with the intention of getting a view
            of the chasm looking up towards the point from which I had taken my first sketch. To
            reach this point was easier said than done, and proved the most difficult and only
            dangerous adventure of the day. However, by lying flat on our breasts and working a
            resting-place or notch with our feet in the crumbling rocks, and occasionally layin hold
            of a projecting root, we succeeded in reaching the desired point. Here, on a projecting
            cliff, grew a few shrubs of the manacita beneath which I crept on my hands and knees ;
            and having reached the point, sat down and took a sketch, while my companion re- freshed
            himself beneath the shade. O" 44 THE GEYSERS OF PLnON RIVER, From this point fi view of

            45 portion of his remarks, which will convey a fuller and J- clearer idea than my feeble
            description. My time while there was short, and mostly spent in making sketches, and in
            collecting a few specimens of sulphur and of the contiguous rocks ; nor had I the means
            of testing or examinino: the waters. * ' You may here find sulphur water/' says
            Professor Shepherd,*- '' precisely similar to the celebrated Wliite Sulphur of Green
            Brier County, Virginia, except its icy m coldness. Also red, bhie, and even black
            sulphur water, both cold and hot. Also pure limpid hot water, without any sulphur or
            chlorine salts ; calcareous hot waters, magnesian, chalybeate, etc., in almost endless
            variety. Every natural facility is afforded for either vapor, shower, or plunging baths.
            Where the heated sulphuretted hydrogen gas is evolved, water appears to be suddenly
            formed, beautiful crystals of sulphur r deposited (not sublimated as by fire), and more
            or less sulphuric acid generated. In some places the acid 4 was found so strong as to
            turn black kid gloves almost immediately to a deep red. * * * From nume- rous
            experiments made here and in the mountains of Virginia, I am confident that all sulphur
            springs possess , a high temperature, after descending below the cold surface water.
            Notwithstanding the rocks are so hot as to burn your feet through the soles of your

            appearance of lava. You find yourself standing not in a solfatara, nor one of the salses

            According to the statement of MacDonald, our AND RETUEX TO SAN FRANCISCO. 47 guide, who
            tad made several visits to the geysers, their activity has greatly diminished, or we saw
            them under less favorable auspices than usual. He said that when last here the water
            spouted up from five to ten feet in height ; that the jets of steam were much larger and
            more steady ; and furthermore, that a day often ex- hibited a material diifference. That
            the action has les- sened, and nearly ceased, is certain as respects the first one we
            visited ; for it now appears like an expiring fire. When Professor Shepherd visited this
            place, a year before us, he says that within the space of half a mile square he "
            discovered from one to two hundred open- mgs, through which the steam issued with
            violence, sending up columns of steam to the height of one hun- dred and fifty to two
            hundred feet," * * * and again, " throwing out jets or volumes of hot scalding water
            some twenty or thirty feet, endangering the lives of those who stood near. In some
            places the steam and water came in contact, so as to produce a constant jet ■ d''eau, or
            spouting fountain, with a dense cloud above the spray, affording vivid prismatic hues in
            the sun- shine." With such jets of water and steam as these, the grandeur of this
            extraordinary spot would be greatly enhanced. Our dinner was soon ready, and we seated
            our- selves on the grass again, with appetites sharpened by a long fast and a laborious
            tramp of nearly ten hours. ■ Sticks of the same delicious bear's meat, and veni- son
            were placed before us, with a second course, on smaller sticks, of some fine grouse
            which MacDonald had shot. This was a bird I had not before seen. It was larger than the
            ordinary prairie fowl, and proved 48 THE GEYSERS OF PLUTON EIVER, m delicious eating. A
            batL. followed our repast, after whicli we rolled ourselves up in our blankets and lay
            down for tlie niglit. The novelties of the day occupied our attention for an hour, when
            we quietly dropped off, ■m and slept as soundly under the protection of the spreading
            oak as beneath a tent or in the most luxurious chamber. These were the first nights I
            spent in the open air, on the bare ground, since I was taken sick near Ures ; and I felt
            a little uneasiness at being so exposed. But I neither took cold nor suffered any other
            incon- venience from it, although in the month of March. One soon becomes habituated to
            this mode of life, and is less liable to colds and illness than when sleeping under a
            roof with the addition of comfortable fires. I learned from the hunters who Avere with
            us the first night that this region abounds in game, particu- larly bears, elk, and
            deer. They had been here but three days before our arrival, and in that time they had
            seen no less than thirty-two bears, most of them of the grizzly species ; the others of
            the brown and black varieties. Of these they had killed and obtained two ; three they
            had wounded and lost. Of deer they had also killed many. The bear's sense of smelling is
            so good, that they soon found out our proximity, and gave us a wide berth. Deer were
            seen all around us. P MarcJi 2itJi. Our excellent guide and hunter, MacDonald, called us
            to breakfast at daylight ; soon after taking which we mounted our animals and befan the
            ascent of the mountain, whose summit we speedily attained. On looking at the valley
            beyond, we found it completely buried in a fog, the tops of the moun- tains alone being
            visible. These appeared like islands AND EETURN TO SAN FRANCISCO. 49 and long necks of
            land in the midst of a vast body of water. While we were on tlie crest of the hi2:h
            "range, a dense fog so completely enveloped us that we could see nothing but the point
            on which we stood. We made our way back much more rapidly than we came, it being earlier
            in the day and much cooler ; so that by twelve o'clock we were at MacDonald's place,
            where we dined and allowed our animals to feed and rest. At half-past two we bade
            farewell to our kind and hospitable hosts, Mr. and Mrs. MacDonald, and resum- ed our
            journey. Stopped for fifteen minutes at Mr. Knight's, when we again pushed on, and
            reached Mr. Kilburn's at sunset. This gentleman was now at home, and gave us a warm
            reception. We learned many particulars from him corroborating the statements we had
            heard of the extraordinary fertility of the soil. in Napa Yalley,'as well as the great
            yield of vegeta- bles on his own land, of which I have before spoken. March 25t7i. Took
            an early start, first makin inquiries of Mr. Kilburn about the locality of some hills of
            " black flint" which we had heard of We had occasionally picked up along the road small
            pieces of obsidian, and were extremely desirous to find whence they came. After many
            inquiries we were directed to the farm of Mr. Kelly, who has a small mill on Napa Creek,
            a short distance from the road. We found Mr. Kelly at home ; and on making known our
            wishes to examine the place referred to, he took a spade and accompanied us to the spot,
            about half a mile distant, on the eastern side of the valley. We found it to be a spur
            of the mountain ridge, about eighty feet in VOL. II. 4 GARDEN. THE GEYSERS OF PLUTOX
            RIVER, heiglit, projecting quite out into tlie plain. The whole seemed full of obsidian,
            covered with a lajer of earth, on which is a thick growth of trees and shrubbery, save
            on the summit, where there is less soil. Here in many places the surface was covered,
            from six to twelve inches in depth, with broken pieces and small boulders of this
            volcanic substance, resembling a newly made macadamized road. Taking the spade, I
            scraped away the fragments and loose pieces to reach the mass below. This we found
            existing: in a conglomerate state. fe The mass m which the obsidian is imbedded is quite
            soft and friable towards the surface ; so that it was difficult to detach it with the
            obsidian adhering to it, except in very small pieces. The largest of the specimens
            obtained was about the size and shape of an ostrich's egg from which they diminished to
            that of a pea. Many pre- sented sharp angles, where they had come in contact and been
            broken. The substance in which the obsi- dian is imbedded resembles a coarse mortar of
            lime, sand, and gravel. I took a sketch of Napa Yalley from these hills, showing Mount
            Diabolo in the dis- tance, which is plainly seen from San Francisco and Sacramento.
            Obsidian is used by the Indians for their arrow- heads in all parts of North America
            west of the Rocky Mountains. It is found too among many tribes to the east of this
            range. The ancient Mexicans made of it the knives which they used in their sacrifices.
            We found small fragments of it along the Gila, wher- ever there had been any Indian
            villages; and also among the ruins of the Casas Grandes, in Chihuahua, t * i i ■ -*f

            the Gila and Salinas Rivers. The Apaches had arrows pointed with the same material. Yet
            I know o£ no other locality where obsidian is found in place in anj of the regions
            visited by the Boundary Commission except this. All the specimens we saw were black,
            occasionally with a smoky or brownish tint.* We now continued our journey, and reached
            Mr. Osborne's at two o'clock. After dinner we rambled over the adjacent hills to obtain
            a better view of this delightful valley, which "lost none of its beauties from whatever
            point it was observed. On the opposite side of the mountains which bound Napa Valley on
            the west, is Sonoma Valley. This is similarly situated, running north and south between
            ranges of low mountains. It likewise pos- great fertility, but has not the picturesque
            beauty of Napa. The same may be said of the valleys of Petaluma, Novato, and San Rafael,
            March 2Qth. Took an early breakfast and. bade adieu to our kind and gentlemanly host,
            who intended to follow us in a few hours. We did not wait for him, as he wished to stop
            on the way, and I was desirous to pay my respects to General Hitchcock and the other
            officers at Benicia before returning to San Francisco. ■ Obsidian is said by Pliny (Nat.
            Hist, xxxvi, 26) to have been first found in Ethiopia by a person named Obsidius, from
            whom it de- rives its name. It occurs also in various parts of Europe, Asia, and
            America, and in the vicinity of most volcanoes. Pliny says that gems, and sometimes
            whole statues, were made of it. He also speaks of four elephants of obsidian, which were
            dedicated by Augustus in the temple of Concord. 52 THE GEYSERS OF PLUTON RIVER, ETC. As
            it was quite reach Benicia cool, we were enabled to ride fast and by two o'clock. Took
            dinner, and afterwards walked out to the military p(?st, when I made my calls upon the
            officers there. Mr. Osborne joined r US at five o'clock, and at seven we took the

            close np my business there before returning to San Diego. To make the most of my time
            while in Cali- fornia, I determined to undertake the journey to Mon- terey by land,
            first sending forward our outfit and supplies. No event of interest happened while here
            except a trip which, in company with a small party, we at- tempted to make in the
            steamer Active, Capt. Alden, attached to the U. S. Coast Survey, to the Faralones. These
            are some small rocky islands, which lie twenty- five or thirty miles off the entrance to
            the Bay of San ■ancisco. The party, however, were so late in assembling, that after
            getting outside the entrance or Golden Gate, it was found we could not reach the Fi I 54
            THE QUICKSILVER MINES islands before nightfall ; in consequence of which the voyage was
            abandoned. April 2d. Left San Francisco at 8 o'clock in the stage for San Jose, forty
            miles distant. We were accompanied by Doctor A. Randall, a gentleman of science long
            resident in the country, and familiar with interest. Our course was south through of the
            San Jose valley, which in many respects the beautiful valley of Naj scarcely an ui It

            settlers upon d but little land under When we take deration the extraordinary fertility
            of the soil in California, it will be seen that such an immense into as this San Jose
            valley is capable of produci deal towards supplying the State with food. Its OF NEW
            ALMADEN, 55 • I value is justly appreciated by the people ; as is shown by the readiness
            with which the stock for a railroad to connect San Jose with San Francisco was taken up.
            The road is excellent for the entire distance, and the stage rolled rapidly over it.
            Three miles from San Jose we passed the mission of Santa Clara, a collection of old
            buildings with a church. Here the land seemed to have been long under cultivation,
            judging from the long rows of venerable and gigantic overgrown oaks which border the
            road. There were also some fine large orchards and vineyards here, which belong to the
            mission. But the stage did not stop ; and we had no time to examine it At half-past
            four, we reached San Jose.* *I cannot refrain from quoting a passage -from Vancouver,
            one of tlie most reliable of the early voyagers to California, giving an account of his
            journey from Monterey to Santa Clara, The reader aviII be struck with the resemblance
            between this district as described by liim and the eautiful valley I visited north of
            San Francisco. " We considered our route to be parallel to the sea-coast ; between which
            and our path, the ridge of mountains extended to tbe south-east- W'ard; and as we
            advanced, their sides and summits exhibited a high degree of 'luxuriant fertility,
            interspersed with copses of various forms and magnitude, and verdant open spaces
            enriched with stately fruit- trees of different descriptions. About noon Ave arrived at
            a very pleasant and enchantinnr lawn, situated amidst a wove of trees at the foot of a
            small hill, by which flowed a very fine stream of excellent water. "We had not proceeded
            far from this delightful spot, when we entered a country I little expected to find in
            these regions. For about twenty miles, it could only be compared to a park which had
            originally been planted with the true old English oak ; the underwood that had pro-
            bably attained its early growth, had the appearance of having been clear- ed away, and
            had left the stately lords of the forest in complete posses- •ion of the soil, which was
            covered with hixuriant herbage, and beauti- 56 . THE QUICKSILVER MI'E3 Santa Clara was
            but recently occupied by a priest ; it bas now shared the fate of all the other missions
            of the State, which have either been abandoned or have F fallen into the hands of
            speculators. April 3c?. After breakfast, walked about the town, but found nothing of
            interest. The pueblo of San Jose, is aii old 'place ; its admirable situation, at the
            head of the rich and beautiful valley I have described, attract- ed the attention of the
            Americans soon after the subju- gation of the country, and it was selected as the
            capitol of the State. This gave to it an impetus, and brought it at once into notice.
            Many hotels and other build- ings soon sprang up, a large city was laid out, and, as is
            usual in such cases, much money was made and lost. But its growth wq,s as suddenly
            checked by the subse- quent selection of another place for the future capitol. It is
            situated about five miles from the southern extremi- ty of the Bay of San Francisco ;
            and being in the centre of one of the most fertile districts in the State, it will yet
            become its first agricultural town. On inquiring for Indians here, I learnt that there
            was a woman of the San Luis Ohtso tribe, living in the place. I lost no time in calling
            upon her, and found she was married to an American. She proved, as I had heard, to be
            quite an intelligent person, about 35 years of age, living in a comfortable house with
            her family around her. On my requesting to know the principal fully diversified with

            words of her language, slie readily complied; and in a few hours, I obtained a most
            satisfactory vocabulary. In the afternoon, we took the stage for New Alma- den, thirteen
            miles distant. Our route lay through a valley. of unequalled beauty, the entire distance
            being dotted with large oaks and sycamores, with an occasional clump of firs and
            red-woods, the latter towering high above all others. There are some clusters of these
            red- woods of enormous size between here and Monterey, of which we heard much, and
            regretted that we had no time to visit them. On reaching the town, I drove at once to
            the house of Mr. Young, the " superintendent of the quicksilver mines, to whom I had a
            letter of introduction from Captain Hallock, U. S. A. of San Fran- Cisco, one of the
            officers of the Company. April AtJi. New Almadeu consists exclusively of the buildings
            belonging to the company which owns the quicksilver mine. It embraces furnaces, store-
            houses, dwelling-houses for the officers and laborers, offices, mechanics' shops, etc.
            Many of them are of wood ; but a large and fine range of substantial brick buildings is
            now in the process of erection, to take the place of the wooden ones. The novelty of the
            business of extracting the quicksilver from the cinnabar, required a number of
            experiments, involving a very heavy ex- penditure ; for there was but one other mine in
            the vorld, that of Almaden in Spain, where the operation was carried on on a large
            scale, and it could not be- expected that' a rival company like this, whose opera- tions
            would effectually destroy the monopoly the latter had for ages enjoyed, would be
            permitted to derive any information from their long experience. Machine- 58 THE

            United States at enormous cost, mucli of wliicli has since "been rejected, either on
            account of the great expense of running it, or its inadequacy to per- form the service
            required. Six furnaces are now in operation reducing the ore, all of which seem to be
            alike, and of the most simple construction. On these furnaces the ore is heaped. A
            steady, though not very strong fire, is then applied. As the ore becomes heat- ed, the
            quicksilver is sublimed ; and then being con- densed, it falls by its own weight, and is
            conducted by pipes which lead along the bottom of the furnace to small pots or
            reservoirs imbedded in the earth, each containing from one to two gallons of the ore.
            The furnaces are kept going night and day, while large drops or minute streams of the
            pure metal are constantly trickling down into the receptacles. From these it is carried
            to the store-house, and deposited in large cast- iron tanks or vats. These are of
            various shapes and sizes, and are fixed in solid beds of stone and mortar. The largest,
            a square vat between four and five feet across, contained twenty tons of pure
            quicksilver. By way of illustrating the great specific gravity of thi metal, a board was
            placed on it, upon which I sat, thus floating upon a bed of quicksilver ; yet my weight
            did not sink the board to the depth of a quarter of an inch. On thrusting my bare arm
            into this vat, a most singu- lar and chilling sensation was produced. I then tooii a
            stick of light and porous wood, which I immersed for about a minute ; and when I
            withdrew it, the metal had penetrated through every portion of it, so that m weight it
            was little less than the quicksilver itself |TI»! V Va § f o 1-1 CO w ■« . h I I I ft !

            by putting it into wrought iron flasks or canisters ' holding 75 pounds each. It is
            dipped up with ladles, and poured into the flasks through an ordi- M nary tin funnel.
            The opening or neck of the flask (which in form is something like a junk bottle) is then
            stopped with a close-fitting screw, put in with a vice, so as to make it tight as
            possible. These flasks, which weigh twenty -five pounds each, are all made in England,
            where I suppose they can be furnished much cheaper than in the United States. From the
            ware- house the flasks are transported by ox-carts to tide- water, about twenty miles
            distant, whence they are shipped to San Francisco. The present (1852) price of the metal
            there is sixty cents a pound, a very great reduction from that which the quicksilver
            from Spain has commanded, though of equal quality. A shipment of a thousand flasks was
            lately made to Canton, by way of an experiment. In China it is chiefly used in the
            manufacture of vermilion and other articles of com- merce.'' * As this is the only
            quicksilver mine yet known in the United States, and is only second in the world to that
            of Almaden, in Spain, a few words on the latter, andof othef quicksilver mines, do not
            seem inap- propriate. Quicksilver, or mercury, has been known from the earliest ages,
            but is found nowhere in large quantities, except in Spain and California- Almaden has
            long been famed for its mines of tliis metal, which, accord- ing to Bowles, are the
            richest in their produce, the most instructive as to the mode of working them, the most
            curious for their natural history, and the most ancient in the world. We find them
            mentioned in Theo- phrastus, three hundred years before Christ, and Vitruvius also
            speaks of them. Pliny places Cisapona, or as it is sometimes written Sisapona, fa 60 TEE
            QUICKSILVER MINES I did not learn what quantity was produced at the time of my visit
            here, but have since seen it stated to be about one thousand flasks per month, or nearly
            a million pounds a year. According to Dumas, the an- in Bcetica, and says that this mine
            was kept sealed with the greatest care, and was only opened to take the quantity of
            cinnabar necessary for the consumption of Rome. (Nat. Hist, xxxiii. 7.) The Romans con-
            sidered this mineral poisSlious ; but notwithstanding this, their matrons painted their
            faces with i,t, and their pointers employed it as a pigment. The Romans certainly worked
            this mifte, but no traces remain of their lalors. The Moors, perhaps owing to sorne
            'prejudice, did not work it.- " The country about Almaden abounds in iron mines ; and
            what is more surjmsing, in the same mine we find iron, mercury, and sulphur, mixed so as
            to form one mass. The neighboring hills are found of the same stone, and on all of them
            the same species of plants grow; from which we. may infer that the mercury does not
            possess any poisonous qualities, as is generally supposed, injurious to vegetation. '
            The brothers Mark and Christopher Fugger, of Germany, undertook to work this mine, and
            contracted to give the government four thousand five hundred quintals (of 100 lbs. each)
            of mercury, annually; but not being able to fulfil their promise, they abandoned it in
            1635, together with the silver mine of Gualcanal, which they also had. While con- nected
            with these mines, however, their riches became proverbial an Spain, and tbeir
            descendants live at present in Germany, with the rank of princes. A branch of this
            family aflerwards took the mine, and worked it till 1645. In the following year, the
            government undertook the man- agement of it. Don Juan Bustamente established the
            furnaces, and also troughs for cooling the mineral. These furnacesare twelve, and ate
            called by the names of the twelve apostles. Each is capable of contain- ing ten tons
            weight of stone. The furnace is kept burning for three days, and the same period is

            the mine, which is situated near the top of a mountain immediately adjoining the works.
            The ascent begins directly in the rear of the store-houses, by a well con- ■ also been
            found in China and Japan : and thougli the amount of the produce is unknown, it is
            believed to be considerable. Le Play, a French geologist, who visited Almaden in 1833,
            describes the mines as being richer than at any former period, furnishing anually nearly
            2,244,000 pounds of mercury. About seven hundred workmen are emjIoyed under ground, and
            two hundred in the operations con- nected with extraction of the metal from the ore at
            the surface. According to Dumas, the following mines yield annually, the annex- ed
            number of quintals of mercury (a quintal is 108 lbs, avoirdupois, nearly) : ■1 Almaden

            understood that Messrs. Rothschild, of London, have the control of the Almaden mines. -
            During the year 1853, the total exports of quicksilver from San Fran- cisco, amounted to
            18,800 flasks, valued at 083,189. All this, together With the large amount used in
            California, was the produet of the New Almaden mine. The following shows to what points
            the quicksilver was exported : " Hongkong, 5,642 flasks, valued at 180,272 ; Shanghae,

            It is a mile in length, and is now only used by mules ; but it is intended to use carts
            and wagons on it. It winds the whole way along the side of the mountain, rising
            twenty-five feet in every hundred until you reach the mouth of the mine, at an elevation
            of a little less than one thousand feet above the com- mencement of the ascent. About
            one hundred and fifty feet direct below the opening, they were digging a tunnel for the
            purpose of intersecting the main shaft. This tunnel, which is cut entirely through the
            solid rock, had already pierced the mountain seven or eight hundred feet, and will, when
            completed, be not much short of one thousand feet. It is about eight feet high, and
            between eight and ten feet wide. This will prove a vast saving in labor ; for the ore up
            to the time of our transported the backs of men in leath sacks from the bottom of the
            shafts to the entrance to the mine, a distance of from two hundred and fifty to three
            hundred feet. It is not the cinnabar alone that has to be thus carried from the bottom
            of the mine, but the refuse rock, which forms a greater bulk than the itself It be
            parated in the but has all to be brought to the surface. We waited for Mr. Bester, the
            engineer, to join before entering the mine ; and as he had not returr from San Jos6,
            where we left him, we determined forego the examination of its interior to-day, and c
            tent face. with what we could see on the I OF NEW ALMADEN. • 63 J The mountain rises one
            hundred and sixty feet above the entrance to the mine, terminating in a cone. On a level
            with the entrance, a quarter of a mile dis- tant, is th.e village, perched on the very
            summit of a rock, in which the miners live with their families. This mountain, as well
            as the others adjoining it, is covered with grass, and dotted with small oaks to its
            summit. There is nothins: to distinsfuish the mountain F in which the mine is worked
            from the others ; hence it is reasonable to suppose that they may also contain veins of
            cinnabar. The intervening valleys are well wooded, and have a thick undergrowth. April
            5th, Set out this morning for the mine, ac- companied.by Mr. Bester, on mules, as the
            journey up was fatiguing, and we wished to preserve our strength for the exploration of
            the various shafts. On reach- ing the entrance, we found all actively employed ; — the
            laborers emerging every minute from the mines, bent under the weight of their loads,
            which they deposited under a shed about eighty feet from the opening. Here the ore was
            separated, the refuse being thrown down the hill, and the rest laid aside to be sent to
            the furnaces. At the same time the mulada ox collection of some eighty or a hundred
            mules, was being loaded with the ore. This was put into sacks or panniers of raw hide,
            which hung across their backs like saddle-bags, each mule carrying on an average a carga
            or three hundred pounds. Men stood by with a balance, in which every mule load was
            weighed, so that the exact quantity of ore sent to the furnaces is known. The weighing
            is also necessary ; as the company pays so much a carga for bringing it 64 THE
            QUICKSILVER MINES from the bottom to the surface, and for transporting it from the mine
            to the furnaces. This plan is preferred by the proprietors to that of employing the
            laborers directly themselves. The work is wholly performed by native Mexicans or
            Californians, the overseers and contractors who employ them being their countrymen,
            though of a better class. These men understand the management of their countrymen better
            than Ameri- cans do ; and the Mexican laborers are better arrieros, and understand all
            that appertains to the mule better than Americans. The laborers wore no clothing, save a
            breech- cloth, 'and a handkerchief around their heads. The arrieros had on but little
            more ; a fancy colored calico shirt being the extent of their additional cos- tume. The
            laborers who bring up the ore to the sur- face make from forty to fifty trips a day. The
            mules make but two journeys from the mine to the furnaces, completing their day's labor
            by one o'clock. They are then turned out to feed in the valley or on the moun- tain
            side, where the grass is good. With so little labor, they are always in fine condition.
            About tvo hundred men are employed in the various operations carried on here. After
            being provided with torches, consisting of a candle fastened to the end of a stick, we
            commenced the descent of the mine, Mr. Bester, the engineer, taking the lead. We first
            advanced some sixty feet in a horizontal direction, after which the shaft takes a turn
            downwards, and soon after becomes perpen- dicular. In such places the descent is made on
            a single notched log, which is preferred by the miners to the OP NEW ALMADEN. 65 8 a
            common ladder ; and although very awkward at first, we soon got used to it. With one
            hand you take hold of the ladder, and with the other the torch. These lad- ders,
            although almost perpendicular, are seldom more than twelve or fifteen feet long, being
            separated by intervals, where the descent is more gradual, with steps cut in the rock.
            In this way we passed down throuerh various shafts or veins to the bottom of the . mine,
            two hundred feet below the entrance. Passa- ges following the .veins of ore extend in
            every direc- tiori, sometimes liorizontalj then per23endicularj and again at every
            inclination. Their whole extent now exceeds seven thousand feet. When a vein is struck,
            it is followed as far as it can be with safety, what- ever may be its course. The
            engineer, who keeps before him a map of the mine, is obliged to have an eye to the
            support of the superincumbent mass. Some of the veins are five feet in diameter, others
            half that r size. Some are also richer than others. f In each of the veins is a single
            miner ; for not more than one can work to advantaire in these narrow re- tle Picks,
            drills, and crowbars are the tools used. The miners are paid in different ways ; some at
            a stipu- lated price for each foot of the rock excavated, and others at a certain rate
            per carga (three hundred ' pounds) of ore carried to the surface. On reaching the
            greatest depth, where the ore is very rich, I took a pick and knocked off some fine
            specimens. We now J retraced our -steps, and reached the open air in safety. It is an
            evidence of the admirable system pursued r ere, and the watchful care exercised by the
            company ' over their employees, that no accident has yet happened J:- PJ _ VOL. II. — 5

            The workmen, nevertlieless, are not without their fears, and have taken their own method
            to secure themselves from harm, by placing in a niche just with- in the entrance to the
            mine, an image of their saint, very prettily decorated with muslin and gaudy silks.
            Before this every man falls on his knees, and says his prayers, invoking the protection
            of the saint during the day. I have never seen a more happy and contented set of
            laborers than these. Knowing the effects of mercury on the system, the question will
            naturally arise in the mind of the reader as to whether those employed in the mine or
            about the furnaces suffer from their close contact with the ore or the quicksilver. The
            miners, and those .who merely handle the cinnabar, are not injured thereby ; but those
            who work about the furnaces, and inhale the fumes of the metal, are seriously affected.
            Salivation is common ; and the attendants on the furnaces are compelled to desist from
            their labor every three or four weeks, when a fresh set of hands is put on. The horses
            and mules are also salivated; and from twenty to thirty of them die every year from the
            effects of the mercury. The ore, after it is deposited near the furnaces, is separated
            according to its quality. The larger masses are first broken up, and then all is piled
            up under sheds near the furnace doors. Seven or eight days are required to fill the
            furnaces, extract the quicksilver, and remove the residuum, the latter being the most
            dangerous part of the process. All is done as much in the open air as possible, the
            furnaces being merely protected by a roof. \ F ,%, \ \ OF NEW ALMADEN. Q7 \ iUflWS I
            took several sketches of the village of New AI- iit fife maden, as well as of the
            exterior of the mine, and the odtosetE picturesque scenery in the vicinity. The company

            Much of it is well timbered. A fine G jgjTv stream of water runs directly through the
            village; and ,.,(] v-'- on its very margin is a natural soda spring, which may U\0 y®
            make this spot doubly attractive. (JcobIc"'- This mine was long known to the Indians,
            who resorted hither for the vermillion which they could col- lect from the cinnabar.
            They had dug some thirty or forty feet into the mountain ; but it does not appear ever
            to have been worked by the Spaniards. In recent times, its commercial value was first
            discovered by Senor Castillero, who became its legal owner. Don Jose Castro, who
            subsequently became proprietor of it, sold out his interest to Barron et Forbes, an En
            lish house doing business in Mexico. Another partn is Mr, Walkinshaw, an English
            gentleman long resident in Mexico, and well skilled in mining. This gentle- man now
            resides about a mile from New Almaden, on one of the natural parks which I have before
            described, and which he is rendering still more beautiful by the introduction of
            fruit-trees, vines, flowering shrubs, etc. To this gentleman, to Mr. Young, the
            superintendent, and Mr. Bester, the engineer, I feel under many obli- gations for the
            civilities extended to me and the gen- tlemen who were with me, in our visit to New
            Alma- den and its mine. After a sumptuous dinner, we took the staare and returned to San
            Jos. G Ajjril Gtk 'in coming to San Jos, I had the double olject in view of visiting the
            quicksilver mine, and of THE QUICKSILVER MIXES . ( continuing on by land to Monterey ;
            but I here learned tliat it would be impossible to proceed further by land, as the heavy
            rains and freshets a few weeks before, had carried away the bridges, and rendered the
            streams im- passable, except by swimming the horses. Thi I did not feel disposed to do :
            so the only alternative was to return to San Francisco, and go to San Diego by water. We
            accordingly took the stage at 8 o'clock, with twen- ty-one passengers inside and out;
            and reached San Francisco at 4 o'clock in the afternoon. I remained in San Francisco six
            days, waiting for a steamer to San Diego ; and during this time I had the pleasure of
            meeting with Captain Sutter, is well knov»' who have heard read of th recent history of

            public by so that it will be super cc fluous at this time to relate them, excepting the
            follow- ing anecdote, which I have not seen in print. While in Oregon, whither he had
            come from the United States, Captain Sutter met with a party who gave such a glowing
            account of California and particu- larly of the valley of the Sacramento, that he
            determin- ed to visit it, believing it to be precisely the rich coun- try and salubrious
            climate of which he was in search. But to get there was not so easy, there being then

            terra incognita e\ to the people who then composed the settlement , j Yerba Buena ; nor
            could he gain any infer specting the river which led to it, or even a it entered the
            bay. His scheme of settling i where 6 rior among the wild Indians, was considered a dan
            • ous one, and efforts were made to dissuade him from it ; but he had made up his mind
            to go, and accordingly got a small boat and set off with a few men to find the
            Sacramento River. They coasted along the bay in vain for several days, and were about to
            abandon their search, when one night as they were moving slowly along by moonlight.
            Captain Sutter himself discovered jL an opening which proved to be the mouth of that
            river. He passed up it, and selected the spot where he built his fort, and of which he
            afterwards obtained a grant from the Mexican government." When we hear of the pioneers
            of the West, we imagine them to be such as our Daniel Boon, who led the life of a
            hunter, trapper, and Indian fighter, until his home was surrounded by settlers, when he
            again moved farther off, desiring always to be beyond the pale of civilization. Captain
            Sutter was not of this class ; althouofh he has had his share in fighting the battles of
            Europe, as well as encountering the Indian on the • • pranie. He has the manners of an

            America ; but speculators took advantage of his easy disposition, led him into wild
            speculations, induced him to lend his name to a large amount, and thus extorted from him
            or compelled him to give up all of his valu- able property, but the Hock farm, where he
            now re- sides. He still seems cheerful, and endeavors to make the most of his
            misfortunes. When I saw him, he told me he had not visited San Francisco for a year.* *

            personal appearance. He was one of the oflBcers of tlie Swiss Guard in tlie Revolution

            first, those of adobe, belongino- to the old town. These are large and well built, many
            being of two stories, with projecting eaves to protect them from the sun. Those of wood
            are of recent erection, and have not the substantial appearance of the adobe buildings ;
            these latter have verj thick walls as a seen- 1 rity from the earthquakes, which, though
            not severe, are Cj[uite common here. An old church stands alone upon the plain east of
            the town, which appeared to be in a ruinous condition. Beyond this is a lagoon, said to
            • have been formerly connected with the bay, but now separated from it by a sandy beach,
            and a grassy mea- dow, about a quarter of a mile in width. The old pre- sidio, or
            garrison, is on an elevation back of the town, towards Point Pinos, and is now occupied
            by United States troops. Monterey has always been noted for its excellent society; and
            although the Americans have monopo- lized every other town in the State, it still
            preserves much of its original character. The old Califoi'nian Or Castilian families are
            still in the ascendancy ; but the * young Americans and other foreigners are making ter-
            rible inroads upon them, and carrying off their fair daughters. Many officers of the
            United States army have married in California; and from what I heard, here and at other
            places, others intend following their example. The young senoritas certainly possess
            many attractions ; and although shut up in this secluded part of the world, without the

            RETURN FROM SAN FRANCISCO need not fear a comparison with our own ladies. In deportment
            they are exceeding gentle and ladylike, with all the natural grace and dignity which
            belong to the Castilian nation. Their complexion is generally as fair as the
            Anglo-Saxon, particularly along the sea coast, with large black eyes and hair. In this
            respect they differ much from the Mexican ladies of the interior, who are generally
            brunettes. In form too they differ from their Mexican sisters. The latter are too often
            short and stout, while the Californian ladies are as slender and delicate in form as
            those of our Atlantic States. I was struck too with the elegance and purity of their
            language, which presented a marked contrast with the corrupt dialect spoken in Mexico.
            The Californians as a people appear superior to the Mexicans, which may be attributed to
            two causes. Both countries, it is true, were colonized by the same race ; but I think a
            superior class of men came to Cali- fornia,, who have preserved their Castilian blood
            from all admixture with that of the aborigines. There were, doubtless, fewer of the
            poorer class too who came here, owing to the greater length and cost of the jour- ney,
            and the increase by immigration has been triflm? since. The original colonists possessed
            large tracts of lands, and have ever since continued in an isolated state, marrying
            among themselves, and enjoying a Hf of luxury and ease. The climate, unlike that of Mex-

            Californian cities, by reason of its superior harbor and great commercial facilities,
            Monterej will become the residence of gentlemen of fortune, on account of its more
            genial climate and its distance from the noise and bustle of a great city. It will be to
            San Francisco what Newport is now to New York. The following account of Monterey was
            written by the Reverend president of the California missions, F. Ju- nipero Serra, to
            his biographer, Father Palou, in a letter announcing his arrival at this place. It
            appears that an expedition sent by land to Monterey failed to reach it, but found San
            Francisco ; and that subsequently two other expeditions, one by land the other by water,
            were sent in search of it. In the latter of these was Father Junipero. He thus writes :*
            " Long live Jesus, Mary, and Joseph ! " Reverend Father, Professor, and President, Fr.
            Francisco Palou : " My dearest Friend and Sir: — On the 31st of May, by the favor of
            God, after a painful voyage of g, month and a half, the packet San Antonio, commanded by
            Ion Juan Peres, arrived and anchored in this horrible port of Monterey, which is the
            same, unaltered in appearance and condition, that it was when visited by the expedition
            of Don Sebastian Yiscayno, in the year 1603. It gave me great satisfaction to learn that
            eight days previous the land expedition had arrived, and with it Father Juan, and that
            all were in good health. When the holy day of Pentecost arrived, * Relacion Historica de

            whole of the officers, naval as well as military, and all the people, assembled together
            in a small ravine, where the Fathers caused an altar to be erected, and the bells to be
            rung. They then chanted the Yeni Creator blessed the water, erected and blessed a grand
            cross and the royal stand- ards, and chanted the first mass that was ever per- forriied
            in this place. We afterwards sung the Salve to our Lady, before an image of the most
            illustrious Virgin, which occupied the altar, and then I preached a sermon. We concluded
            the festival with a Te Deim. After this i\Q officers took possession of the coun-- try
            in the name of our Lord the King, whom God pre- serve. We all dined together in a shady
            place on the beach ; the whole ceremony being accompanied many volleys and salutes, on

            to the former expedition, its not finding the port of which it was in search, and
            ha'V'ing asserted that it did not exist, I will express no opinion, and wil not judge of
            their motives. It 'is enough to say, that it has been found, and the duty performed,
            although rather late. This I desire may be made known to the Visitor General, and to all

            ride was a. delightful one over gentle hills, and through valleys with beauti- ful
            grassy slopes, thickly wooded with pine, fir, and oak trees. The whole country about
            Monterey presents ,a most pleasing prospect to the eye, after seeing the parched and
            barren hills along the coast. The Mission establishment, which consists of a church and
            the usual accompaniments of a large inclosure with ranges of small buildings, stands
            upon a little elevation between the hills and the sea, from which it is distant only a
            few hundred yards. The church which is built of stone, has two towers, containing six
            bells ; its walls are very thick, with an arched roof, and supported by heavy but-
            tresses. The towers, as usual, differ. The adobe build- ings near, were all in a state
            of ruin, and tenantless ; not a human being was to be seen near, while the rank grass
            and weeds which monopolized the ground, showed that even curiosity did not often tempt
            visitors to its deserted precincts. One corner of the church began to show the ravages
            of time: its cornice had fallen, and weeds had already taken root among its opening
            crevices. The remains of an orchard and vineyard, are still seen near, in a decaying
            state. Small pine trees cover the tills within a short distance of the church ; and on
            its other side, the ocean rolls up its waves with a dull mo- notonous sound, which adds

            time the residence of the Fathers Juniper Serra, and Francisco Palou, two of the most
            distinguished of the early Catholic missionaries in California. When Father P. Font
            arrived in Monterey, in 1777, from Sonora, in Mexico, with a body of men to strengthen
            the Colony at that place, he says the " Fa- ther President, F. Junipero SerrajWith four
            other priests, came from the mission of San Carlos to welcome us, and we chanted mass in
            thanksgiving for our safe arrival;" and it " was determined that we should go to the
            mission of Carmel, as there were no lodgings for us here."*. . He states that there were
            seven priests at the mission, that it was "an excellent spot, and the land very
            fertile." A'pril 17th. Set sail from Monterey in the U. S. revenue cutter Frolic,

            smuggler. Finally came up with and hailed her ; when she was found to be a small craft

            roadstead, about fifteen miles across from the two points which bound it, and scarcely
            deserves the name of a harbor. It is exposed to the prevailing winds, and affords no
            protection save on the east and north. When caught with a southerly gale, vessels are
            obliged to stand across to the islands of Catalina, twelve miles distant, for safe- ty.

            carted from a distance of three miles. Many also provide tliemselves Here with beef,
            which is furnished at a less rate than at other places. I was desirous to visit Los
            Angeles for the purpose of buying mules, which were scarce and high -at San Diego.. Soon
            after breakfast I went on shore with Captain Ottinger, and we both took the stage then
            about to start for Los Ansreles. There were twelve (T- passengers to go, who filled two
            ordinary lumber wa ons, each drawn by four mules. On leaving the coast, the road was
            somewhat hilly for a few miles. Passed several lagoons about three miles from San Pedro,
            in which were large numbers of ducks, plover, curlew, and snipe, embracing varieties
            which I had not before seen ; on leaving these, we entered upon a broad plain, which
            extended as far as the eye could reach, unbroken by hill or tree. This plain, the
            surface of which was slightly undulating, was covered with luxuriant grass and clover ;
            and sometimes a patch of yellow mustard, growing to the height of five or six feet,
            filled a space of a mile or two. Flowers of bril- liant hues were thickly scattered over
            the plain, giving it here and there a tingle of purple, orange, or yellow. In every
            direction, the eye fell upon large herds of cattle and horses luxuriating on the rich
            grass; so numerous were they, that at one time there could not have been less than ten
            thousand head in sight. It was here that a skirmish took place between Com- modore
            Stockton, or a party sent by him, and the Cali- fornians ; but from what I could learn,
            it was little TO SAN DIEGO. 81 I t K 1- • more than a running fight, in which no great
            harm was done by either party. . We reached " La Ciudad de los Angeles," the City of
            Angels, at 4 o'clock, and put up at the "Bella Union," a very indifferent hotel. At the
            most misera- ble tavern in the back woods, I have found better accommodations than at
            this place. After dinner, I called at the office of the " Los An- geles Star," to obtain
            a file of the paper, which contains a series of articles on the Californian Indians. Mr.
            Rand, one of the editors, cheerfully complied with my request, and gave me the papers I
            desired. I also met Mr. Hayes here, a gentleman connected with the bar, who, with Mr.
            Rand, manifested much interest in the obj ects of my inquiry ; and Mr. Hayes kindly
            offered ', to accompany me to the mission of San Gabriel, twelve '* miles distant, where
            resided Mr. Hugo Reid, the author of these papers. These gentlemen informed me that Mr.
            Reid was better acquainted with the Indians of that portion of the State than any other
            person. With the hope therefore of obtaining more information on this [ subject, I
            gladly accepted the proposal of Mr. Hayes; r and we agreed to set off for the Mission as
            soon as It ■1.- m! }Sl I horses could be procured. After waiting two hours, the horses
            promised Mr. Rand were still not forthcoming ; we were therefore compelled to give up
            our ride this afternoon, and post- pone it until morning. I regretted this, as I had in-
            tended to pass the evening at the Mission, and return m the morning in time to take the
            stage back to San Pedro, The horses were promised to be saddled and at the door by 5
            o'clock in the morning. i VOL. ir. — 6 82 RETURN FROM SAN FRANCISCO Spent the hour that
            remained before dark in walk- ing over the hills with Mr. Hayes. Los Angeles is situ-
            ated in one of the finest agricultural districts in the State. It has at various times
            contained from fifteen hundred to two thousand inhabitants, and was formerly a place of
            much wealth. There are many large haci- endas and ranchos in the valley, which is in a
            high state of cultivation, abounding in orchards and vineyards. Judging of the wine I
            saw, and the imperfect mode fol- lowed in producing it, there is no doubt that an
            article of superior quality might be made here in abundance. I saw more Indians about
            this place than in any part of California I had yet visited. They were chiefly " Mission
            Indians," i. e. those who had been connected with the missions, and derived their
            support from them until the suppression of those establishments. They ■ are a miserable
            squalid-looking set, squatting or lying about the corners of the streets, without
            occupation. They have now no means of obtaining a living, as their lands are all taken
            from them ; and the missions for whichfthey labored, and which provided after a sort for
            many thousands of them, are abolished. No care seems to be taken of them by the
            Americans ; on the ;ontrary, the effort seems to be, to exterminate them .as §oon as
            possible. One of the most intelligent of fthem, who was brought to me by the kindness of
            my friends here, was unacquainted with the name of the tribe to which he belonged, and
            only knew that it had been attached to certain missions. ' I obtained from him a
            vocabulary, which I found on examination, to be the Diegeno language, with some words
            different from that obtained at San Diego. TO SAN DIEGO. 83 1i April 3(7. Up at
            daylight, to reach the Mission of San Gabriel by breakfast- time ; but the horses were ,
            not ready, as promised. After waiting three hours, we concluded to breakfast here. The
            horses at last were brought, the only excuse for the delay being that they could not be
            caught before. It now began to rain; but hoping that it would not continue, we set off,
            Mr. Rand accompanying me. But after we had got about three miles, the prospect for fair
            weather grew less encouraging ; and as we were already pretty wet, we thought it best to
            give up the jaunt and return, much to my regret. Being thus disappointed in seeing the
            Mission, I was kindly furnished by the editors of the " Los Angeles Star " with the
            following brief H account of it, which had appeared in their paper a few days before :
            "Situated in the midst of a fertile valley, surround- ed with abundant timber, and
            supplied by a thousand springs, with an inexhaustible flow of water, the Mission of San
            Gabriel flourished and became exceed- ingly rich. Authentic records are said to exist
            which show that at one time the mission branded fifty thousand calves, manufactured
            three thousand barrels of wine, and harvested one hundred thousand fanegas (two hun-
            dred and sixty-two thousand bushels) of grain a year. The timber for a brigantine was
            cut, sawed, and fitted at the mission, and then transported to and launched at San
            Pedro. Five thousand Indians were at one time col- lected and attached to the mission.
            They are repre- sented to have been sober and industrious, well clothed and fed ; and
            seem to have experienced as high a state of happiness as they are adapted by nature to
            receive. 84 RETURN FROM SAN FRANCISCO " These five thousand Indians constituted a large
            family, of which the Padres were the social, religious, and we might almost say
            political, heads. " Living thus, this vile and degraded race began to learn some of the
            fundamental principles of civilized life. The institution of marriage began to be re-
            spected, and, blessed by the rites of religion, grew to be so much considered that
            deviations from its duties were somewhat unfrequent occurrences. The girls, on their
            arrival at the age of puberty, were separated from the rest of the population, and
            taught the useful arts of sewing, weaving, carding, etc., and were only permitted to
            mingle with the population when they had assumed the characters of wives. " When at
            present we look around and behold the state of the Indians of this country — when we see
            their women degraded into a scale of life too menial to be even domestics — when we
            behold their men brutalized by drink, incapable of work, and following a system of petty
            thievery for a living, humanity can- not refrain from wishing that the dilapidated
            Mission of San Gabriel should be renovated, its broken walls be rebuilt, its roofless
            houses be covered, and its desert- ed halls be again filled with its ancient
            industrious, happy, and contented original population." I noticed here quantities of
            craw-fish, weighing from two to ten pounds, which are taken in this bay. We ate of them,
            and bought a quantity to take to our friends in San Bieoro. Their flavor resembles that
            of the lobster, but is so much inferior that they would hardly be tolerated on the

            craft scudded before it with great speed, the log showing thirteen and a half miles an
            hour. This continued during the night, carrying us rapidly towards our place of
            destination. April 24:th. Passed Point Loma at eight o'clock, and before nine anchored
            at San Diego. The first news I heard was the removal of Mr. Gray as survey- or, and the
            appointment of Major Emory in his place. This compelled me to discharge all Mr. Gray's
            party, and commit the completion of the survey of the Gila to Lieutenant Whipple, — an
            arrangement which re- duced the party about to retrace its steps to the Rio Grande about
            two fifths. We now set vigorously to work to prepare for our return. Our animals, which
            were so comletely used up in the journey out, had now recovered their strength, with the
            exception of five or six, which were past recovery. I had been unable to purchase any
            mules at Los Angeles or elsewhere to the north, and was compelled to depend wholly upon
            San Diego and its vicinity to make up our deficiencies. Our camp equipage had been
            procured in San Francisco ; but the harness and pack-saddles needed mending and putting
            in order. The wagons also required the labor of the blacksmith and carpenter on them. A
            few days after my return, I was waited upon by Mr. Antoino Leroux, of New 3Iexico, the
            celebrated guide who had conducted Colonel Cooke and his brigade to California in 1846,
            '47, and who had a short time before arrived with the exploring party under Captain
            Sitgreaves, which he had conducted by the 86 RETURN FROM SAN FRANCISCO ZuSi River to the
            Colorado, and thence by Fort Yuma to California. Mr. Leroux now wished to re- turn to
            New Mexico, and offered me the services of himself and two men, together with several
            pack and riding mules, for a moderate compensation. As my party was now quite reduced,
            and as it was necessary to hire more men, I gladly accepted the proposals of Mr. L., and
            placed the animals and arrieros directly under his charge, with orders fo prepare the
            train as soon as possible for the march. While these preparations were being made,
            Lieute- nant Whipple and his assistants were busily occupied in reducing his
            astronomical observations, and in plot- ting the maps of the survey of the Gila as far
            as it had been carried. Duplicates were also made of all the notes connected with the
            survey, which were trans- mitted by an officer to Washington for safe keeping. For
            Lieutenant Whipple's Report of the survey of the Gila, see Appendix D. Before Captain
            Ottinger left, he invited me, with others of the Commission, to accompany him on m
            excursion to the Coronado Islands, a small group lying twenty miles from San Diego. Some
            ten or twelve gentlemen availed themselves of the Captain's polite- ness; and, on the
            morning of the 5th of May, the "Frolic" stood out to sea with a north-west wind, which
            brought us to the islands in three hours. . We came to anchor about a quarter of a mile
            east of the larger and more southerly island of the group. One party immediately went
            with Captain Ottni ger to examine the anchorage about the islands, while the other
            landed. This island rises so abruptly fro TO SAN DIEGO. 87 the sea, that it was with
            some difficulty that we could find a landing place. Seeing a little nook, which the
            dashing waters had worn away from the rocky mass, we made for this, and succeeded in
            getting on shore. From this place it required much labor to clamber . up the rocks for
            some fifty feet ; after which the ascent became easy, and we met with no difficulty in
            reaching the crest of the island, half a mile distant. The island is a solid
            wedge-shaped rock, about five hundred feet high, save at the point where we landed,
            where it is slightly shelving. It runs north-east and south-west, and is about a mile in
            length, by half that in breadth at its widest part. Towards the northern end its breadth
            is less than a quarter of a mile. There is some soil on its surface ; yet it is entirely
            destitute of trees. A few small shrubs are seen ; and wherever there is soil, it is
            covered with grass and a great abun- dance of wild flowers, which in certain spots are
            so numerous, that they appear like patches of orange, purple, and yellow, when seen from
            the water. I walked across and along the whole length of the island, but could descend
            in no place except where we landed. Cacti and other plants grew among the rocks, of
            which Mr. Thurber obtained specimens. About a mile to the north-west is another island
            of nearly the same dimensions as that we were upon, and between them two smaller ones,
            or rather two masses of rocks, some fifty feet high, without any vegetation. It was

            SAN DIEGO. 89 While the preparations were being made for our journey, I made a brief
            visit to the Mission of San Luis Rey, forty miles north of San Diego. This is the latest
            of all the California missions, and was founded in 1798. It stands in a rich valley,
            from one to two miles wide, and is about three miles from the ocean, being separated
            therefrom by a range of hills. Of all the missionary establishments in the State, this
            possesses the most extensive as well as the most imposing struc- ture. It is built of
            adobe, although stone and brick are used in some portions of it. It faces the south, and
            has a front of five hundred and thirty feet, the greater por- tion of wliich exhibits a
            colonnade of some architectural beauty, although but sixteen or eighteen feet high.* On
            the front is also a church ninety feet in depth, with a tower and dome. North and south,
            the dimensions are upwards of six hundred feet. This vast space included every thing
            that appertained to the mission. On the south-eastern corner is a small Campo Santo.
            Next comes the church with the priests' apartments immedi- ately adjoining, and a small
            inclosure, or garden, shut in by the church walls on one side and by the main build- ing
            on the other. This garden was handsomely laid out, and still contains a variety of fruit
            and ornamental trees. The main building is about three hundred feet square, with a
            colonnade in front. In the interior, is an open area of the same dimensions, with a
            beautiful colonnade all around. In the centre of this was a gar- ien ; but the only
            plant of interest that remains, is a « been The general plan of this building and its

            rows of apartments, some of which are very large, in- cluding reception rooms, dining'
            halls, sleeping apart- ments, kitchen, etc. In the rear were corrals or inclo- siires for
            cattle ; so that every thing fippertaining to this vast establishment mig-ht be brous:ht
            within its walls. It is all in a good state of preservation except the north-west corner
            of the area, where the roof has fallen in. Some of the cattle yards and stables are also
            out of repair. But the church, and nearly all the apart- ments occupied for dwellings,
            are still habitable. TO SAN DIEGO. 91 r This establishment had been abandoned with most
            of the other Californian missions; but when the United States became the possessors of
            the country, several claimants sprang up for it, and its valuable lands adja- cent, some
            resting on purchase, pretended or real, and some on other grounds. It is said to have
            been pur- chased by some native Californians from the govern- ment about the time the
            country was changing owners, who sold it to the Americans. Its ownership will be settled
            by the Board of Land Commissioners appointed by the United States government for the
            purpose. In the mean time General Hitchcock, commanding the Pacific Division of the U.
            S. Army, has placed a file of soldiers here, to protect the property and keep off" plun-
            derers and squatters. I remained here two nights, accompanied by Dr. Webb and Mr. Pratt,
            artist of the Commission, and was hospitably entertained by the Sergeant in charge ; the

            of buildings and cultivated grounds, a prince or a nabob might luxuriate to his heart's
            content. Near by is an extensive orchard and garden, inclosed with high walls, and
            filled with every variety of fruit-trees ; but the acequias, or irrigat- ing canals, had
            been neglected, the dams and embank- ments washed away, and the beautiful gardens and
            shady walks, where the devotees passed the Ion hours when not attending to their
            religious duties, were all overflowed. A swamp filled with rushes and rank weeds had
            taken possession of these walks and groves ; and here the screaming- heron and other
            water fowl had their hiding-places. o 92 RETURN FROM SAN FRANCISCO The Sergeant, at mj
            request, sent for an old Indian of the neighborhood, who called himself a chief On
            learning that an ofietcer of the U. S. government wished to see him, he made his
            appearance with three others of his tribe. The old man presented himself in the dress of
            a Mexican officer — a blue coat with red faciii2:s ed with gold lace, and a high
            military cap and feather. He was quite communicative, and my questions readily. In
            QxyxLi his language, he enunciated them with great distinctness, and would not be
            satisfied with my pronunciation until all could at once recognise the word. When I had
            completed my vocabulaiy, and read off the native words, he evinced great pleasure as he
            repeated the corresponding word in Spanish, occasionally exclaim- Bueno or Muy JBiieno f
            He called his tribe the Jo Kech I. On inquiring as to the state of things when the
            padres were here, the old man heaved a deep sigh. He said his tribe was large, and his
            people all happy, when the good fathers were here to protect them. That they cultivated
            the soil ; assisted in rearing large herds of cattle ; were taught to be blacksmiths and
            carpen- ters, as well as other trades ; that they had plenty to eat, and were happy. He
            remembered when three thousand of his tribe were settled in the valley, depend- ent upon
            or connected with this mission. Now he said they were scattered about, he knew not
            where, with- out a home or protectors, and were in a miserable starv- ing condition. A
            few hundred alone remained in some • villages up the valley, a few miles from the
            mission. He spoke with much affection of Father Peyri, its TO SAN DIEGO. 93 original
            'founder, who had resided here for thirtj-four years. At no time, he said, were there
            more than six- teen Spanish soldiers here, who occupied a building facing the mission,
            which is still standing. Father Antonio Peyri took possession of this Mis- sion of San
            Luis Rey (i. e. St. Louis the king) in the year 1798. He first built a small thatched
            cottage, and asked for a few cattle and Indians from the mission. At the end of his
            thirty-four years residence, he left it . stocked with nearly sixty thousand head of
            domesti- cated animals of all sorts, and yielding an annual pro- . duce of about
            thirteen thousand bushels of grain. Af- ter so many years of successful labor, in which
            he ex- pended the most valuable part of his life, the worthy Father left his mission
            with only what he judged suffi- cient means to enable him to join his convent in the
            city of Mexico, where he threw himself upon' the charity of his order. The toil of
            managing such an establish- ment, would be sufficient motive for a man of Father Peyri's
            age to retire ; but the new order of things, which had introduced new men and new
            measures, accele- rated his resignation. Whatever his motives may have been, his
            voluntary retirement in poverty, to spend the remainder of his days in pious exercises,
            must be applauded by the religious ; and his noble disinterest- edness bv all. Mr.
            Alexander Forbes, who met the venerable Peyri, and who has given us this account of his
            history, thus closes his remarks on this mission, and the affection entertained by the
            Indians for their pastor : " The best and most unequivocal proof of the good conduct of
            these Fathers, is to be found in the unbounded affec- 94 RETURN FROM SAN FRANCISCO tion
            and devotion invariably shown towards them by their Indian subjects. They venerate them
            not merely as friends and fathers, but with a degree of devotedness approaching to
            adoration. On the occasion of the removals that have taken place of late years, from po-
            litical causes, the distress of the Indians in parting with their pastors has been
            extreme. They have entreated to be allowed to follow them in .their exile, with tears
            and lamentations, and with all the demon- strations of true sorrow and unbounded
            affection. In- deed, if there ever existed an instance of the perfect justice and
            propriety of the comparison of the priest . and his disciples to a shepherd and his
            flock, it is in the case of which we are treating. These poor people may indeed be
            classed with the ' silly sheep' rather than with any other animal ; and I believe they
            would, in the words of the poet, even ' lick the hand though it was raised to shed their
            blood' — if this were the hand of the friar."* The harbor of San Diego is second only to
            that of San Francisco on the Californian coast. On the north and north-west, it is
            formed by Point Loma, a neck of land which stretches far into the ocean terminated by a
            bold bluff, one of the most prominent and well-mark- ed headlands on the coast. From
            this the shore takes an easterly direction for about four miles, when it turns and runs
            from twelve to fifteen miles towards the south. The southern and western shores of the
            bay, are low and sandy. The south-western shore is no more than a sand beach, connected

            "aj, is a promontory about two hundred feet high, and nearly two miles wide, tapering
            off gradually with a succession of hills as it approaches the town. These nills were
            covered with chapporal; their declivities, toth on the side of the ocean and of the
            harbor, being cut into deep ravines. At the base on the inner side, is good grazing. The
            entrance to this harbor is not more than three or Jour hundred yards wide. There is a
            deep channel lead- ing into the inner harbor, which requires some skill in 96 RETURN
            FROM SAN FRANCISCO navigating ; but -when once the entrance is passed, there is an
            abundance of water. ' I saw large ships some six miles within this harbor, and was
            informed that the Pacific mail steamers, and one of our frigates, had also been there.
            An accurate survey has lately been made by the United States " Coast Survey" and
            elaborate maps published with the soundings and all the bearings laid down, to enable
            navigators to enter it. About half a mile from Point Loma, is the Playa, or beach, where
            the mail steamers, and other vessels, stop for coal and supplies. It is convenient of
            access with any wind, and affords a safe anchorage. Here is a small village, and the
            "hide houses " which have he- come somewhat celebrated ffom the graphic account of life
            in California, and the process of curing hides, given by Mr. Dana, in his "Two Years
            before the Mast." They still stand precisely as he describes them, and are now only used
            as barns or store-houses. A fine road along the beach leads to the old town of San
            Diego, standing on a flat at the base of a high hill which extends about two miles to
            the south : this flat reaches more than a mile into the bay, preventing the nearer
            approach of vessels or boats. It also extends northwardly to a shallow opening on the
            north side of the promontory before described, called " False Bay." At San DiegO, a
            small stream runs into the bay ; but during the summer, it becomes dry. At its floods,
            it brings down great quantities of sand, which are de- posited in the channel ; whence
            fears of serious injury to the harbor have been entertained. To obviate this, it has
            been proposed to change the course of the river to False Bay, into which it formerly
            run. It would no TO SAN DIEGO. 97 . doubt be beneficial, and the plan is worthy the
            atten- tion of the government. Three miles south of San Diego is another town near the
            shore of the bay, which was surveyed and plotted by Mr. Gray, U. S. Surveyor to the
            Boundary Commission, while on duty here. This is called "New San Diego." It consists of
            a few substantial frame houses, and is the depot for the United States Subsist- ence and
            the Quarter-master's Departments. A large and fine wharf was built here at a great
            expense ; but there is no business to bring vessels here, except an occasional one with
            government stores. There is no Water nearer than the San Diego river, three miles dis-
            tant. Efforts indeed are making to find it with an Ar- tesian well ; but with what
            success, remains to be seen. There is no timber near, and wood has to be brought some
            eight or ten miles : nor is there any arable land within four miles. Without wood,
            water, or arable land, this place can never rise to importance. At the head of the bay
            are some good lands with pastures for The bottom lands along the stream back of the old
            town of San Diego, possess great fertility, and With proper attention might be made very
            productive. The admirable harbor of San Diego and its position on the coast, will always
            make it an important stopping place for shipping ; but whether the Playa or beach near
            the entrance, the old town of San Diego, or " Gray Town" as New San Diego is called by
            the people of the old town, will have the ascendancy, remains to be seen : ■ each has
            its advantages and disadvantages. It appears from the early Spanish writers, that the
            promontory north-west of the harbor was once well VOL. u._7 -f 98 RETURN FROM SAN
            FRANCISCO wooded; a fact not generally known. The earliest published account of this
            harbor, must possess an inter- est for all who watch the progress of California. The
            reader, too, will perceive, as in the case of San Fran- cisco and Monterey, that the
            early discoverers saw the great advantages of the places ; although it was left for the
            Americans one hundred and fifty years later to avail themselves of them. The United
            States were in pos- session of California before the discovery of its gold placers ; and
            although they have been the means of its rapid advancement to the extraordinary rank it
            has attained, yet without the later have become what from its agricultural resources and
            great advantag Sebastian Yiscaino having been employed as early the year 1594 in the "
            pacification and conquest of California," was selected as the head of an expedition
            fitted out for further explorations and colonization in 1602. After touching at various
            places in Lower Cali- fornia, it reached the Coronados Islands. " To the north of these
            islands," says the narrative, "on the main land, is the famous harbor called San Diego,
            which the squadron entered at seven in the evening, on the 10th of December; and the day
            following, the general ordered several persons to survey a forest lying on the
            north-west side of the bay. This expedi- tion was undertaken by Ensign Alarcon, Captain
            Pe- guero, Father Antonio de la Ascension, and eight soldiers. In this forest they found
            tall and straight oaks and other trees, some shrubs resemblinor rosemary, and a great
            variety of fragrant and wholesome plants. « \ ■f-'ll :■; ' X a5 I O PL. C O m ■-Wj I m

            appeared spacious, convenient, and well sheltered. The forest borders on the harbor,
            towards the north-west, and is about three leagues in length, and half a league in
            breadth. And to the north-west of the wood is another harbor. On their return with their
            eport to the general, he ordered a tent to be pitched 1 for religious worship, and that
            the ships should be cleaned and tallowed, the people in the mean time being employed in
            wooding and keeping guard. Thej had their water from a little island of sand, where they
            dug deep trenches, in which, during the flood, the water was fresh and good, but on the
            ebb salt. One day a sentinel placed in the wood gave notice that he saw a great number
            of Indians coming along the shore, naked, and their skins daubed with black and white
            colors, and armed with bows and arrows. On this the general desired Father Antonio to go
            and offer them peace. He was attended by Ensign Juan Francisco and six soldiers. On
            coming up to the Indians, hav- ing made signs of peace with a bit of white linen, and
            throwing the earth up with their hands, the savages mmediately delivered their bows and
            arrows to the 1 soldiers. Father Antonio embraced them ; gave them bread and necklaces,
            with which they were greatly % pleased. But on coming to the general's quarters, the
            Indians, at the sight of such a number of men, drew oack to a little eminence, from
            whence they sent two Women. These approaching the general's tent with a timid air, the
            religious and others made them presents of beads, biscuits, and strine-s of buerles :
            and then b" v. »"0 dismissed them, to give their country 100 RETURN FROM SAN FRANCISCO
            of the usage they had met with from the strangers. Their report was doubtless very
            favorable ; for soon after they all came with them to see the Spaniards. Most of them
            were painted or besmeared with black and white, and their heads loaded with feathers.
            The Fi general and others received them with great courtesy, distributing among them
            several things, and a great many fish which had been caught with the net in their
            presence. The kind of paint they used looked like a mixture of silver and blue color ;
            and on asking them by signs what it was, they gave them a piece of metal- lic ore, from
            whence they made it ; and signified by signs that a certain people up the country, who
            had beards and were clothed like the Spaniards, made from this material very fine
            ribbons, resembling the laces on the soldiers' buff coats ; and some like that on a pur-
            ple velvet doublet, in which the general was then •dressed ; adding, that these men, by
            their dress, com- plexion, and customs, seemed to be of the same coun- ?try with
            themselves. The Indians were quite trans- ported with the good treatment shown them, and
            every third day came for biscuit and fish, bringing with them skins of several kinds of
            beasts, as sables, wild cats, and the nets with which they catch them Another
            interesting account of San Diego is con- tained in a letter written by Father Junipero

            Diego, truly a fine one, and with rea- son famous. Here I found those who had set out
            before me, by sea as well as by land, excepting such as died on the way. The brethren,
            Fathers Crespi, Biscayno, Parron, and Gomez are here, and, with my- self, all well,
            thanks be to God. Here are also two vessels ; but the San Carlos is without seamen, all
            having died except one and the cook. The San An- tonio, although she sailed a month and
            a half later, arrived twenty days before the San Carlos, losing on the voyage eight
            seamen. In consequence of this loss, the San Antonio will return to San Bias, to procure
            seamen for herself and the San Carlos. The causes of the delay of the San Carlos were,
            first, the want of water, a-nd, second, the error which all were in respect- ing the
            situation of this port. They supposed it to be in thirty-three or thirty-four degrees
            north latitude; and strict orders were given to Captain Vila and the rest to keep out in
            the open sea till they should arrive in thirty-four degrees, and then make the shore in
            search of the port. As, however, the port in reality lies in 32° 34', according to the
            observations which have now been made, they went far beyond the port, thus making the
            voyage much longer than was neces- sary. The peopla got daily worse from the cold and
            the bad water ; and they must all have perished, if they tad not discovered the port

            suffered hunger or privations, neither have the Indians who came with us ; all have
            arrived fat and healthy. The track through which we have passed is generally very good
            land, with plenty of water ; and there, as well as here, the country is neither rocky
            nor overcome with brush- wood. There are, however, many hills, but they are composed of
            earth. The road has been in many places good, but the greater part bad. About half way,
            the valleys and banks of rivulets began to be delightful. We found vines of a large
            size, and in some cases quite loaded with grapes ; we also found abundance of roses,
            which appeared to be the same as those of Castile. In fine, it is a good country, and
            very different from that of Old California. We have seen Indians in immense numbers; and
            all those on this coast of the Pacific con- trive to make a good subsistence on various
            seeds, and by fishing ; this they carry on by means of rafts, or canoes made of tule
            (bulrush), with which they go a great way to sea. They are very civil. All the males,
            old and young, go naked ; the women, however, and even the female children, were
            decently covered from their breasts downwards. We found in our journey, as well as in
            the places where we stopped, that they treated us with as much confidence and good will
            as if they had known us all their lives ; but when we offered them any of our victuals,
            they always refused them. All they cared for was cloth; and only for something of this
            sort would they exchange their fish or whatever else they had. " From this port and

            the valley, is the venerable Mission of the same name, a spot possessing great
            picturesque beauty, and Mission of San Dieca surrounded by fertile and well watered
            lands. It was the last of the California missions that was abandoned ; and but five
            years ago its ancient library and its 104 RETURN FROM SAN FRANCISCO priest still
            remained. The buildings, which are of adobe, are not extensive, but are in good
            preservation. They possess more of an Oriental appearance than any similar
            establishments. There was formerly a large vineyard and orchard, containing figs,
            peaches, etc., a portion of which is still in existence. The place is celebrated also
            for a flourishing orchard of olive trees, which still remains, yielding a great abun-
            dance of olives, the excellence of which we had an opportunity of testing on our
            homeward journey. The mission is at present occupied by United States troops, under the
            command of Colonel J. B. Magruder, and in consequence is kept in good repair. San Diego,
            like Monterey, is noted for its excellent society. There remain many of the old
            Castilian families here, who have preserved their blood from all admixture with the
            Indians. In this circle, all Ame- ricans and foreigners visiting the place have expe-
            rienced much pleasure; for such is its refined and social character, that one almost
            imagines himself again enjoying the delights. of home. The Californian ladies are said
            to possess all the finer qualities of the sex, whether of the head or the heart, and to
            make most excellent wives. Such have been the attractions of these fair senoritas for
            the young American officers, that many have been induced to relinquish their com-
            missions in the United States army, and become planters or stock raisers in California.
            While detained here, I took occasion to visit the monument erected at the Initial Point,
            on the Pacific, of the boundary between the United States and Mexi- co, one marine
            league south of the southernmost point TO SAN DIEGO. 105 of the Bay of San Diego." It is

            sufficiently ;ensive to enable me to discuss at length its a2:ricul- tural resources,
            nor would an essay of such a character properly belong to a " personal narrative." But I
            saw sufficient in the valleys of San Jose, Napa, Carmel, near Monterey, Los Angeles, San
            Luis Rey, and San Diego, to enable me most confidently to assert that a finer
            agricultural country does not exist on the face of the globe. Cereals of every
            description, wheat, maize, barley, peas, rye, and oats grow to perfection, some in one
            portion, others in other portions of the State, every where yielding more than in any
            part of the Atlantic States or the Mississippi Valley. Fruits of every kind, including
            the grape, apples, pears, peaches, plums,- cherries, etc., arrive at perfection. But m
            vegetables especially, whether we regard their variety, their enormous yield, or their
            excellent flavor, Califor- nia certainly surpasses any thing I have ever seen m the
            United States. But the valleys I have mentioned are small in comparison with the broad
            and magnificent basins of the Sacramento and San Joachin Rivers and their numerous
            tributaries. The head waters of the San Joachin and the Tulare plains, which are yet
            unexplored and unsettled, are said to be admirably adapted to the cultivation of rice
            and cotton. The 'I southern part of the State is more barren, having fewer streams and
            valleys, with little or no timber. But here occur those large grassy plains or prairie
            such as that between the coast and Los Angeles, so well adapted to the raising of
            cattle. East of the mountains which form the continuation of the SieiTa Nevada is a
            broad sandy desert, extending from the TO SAN DIEGO. ' 107 head of the Gulf of
            California to the unexplored region and great Central Basin, with which we have been
            made acquainted by Colonel* Fremont. This desert is from one to two hundred miles in
            width, and alike destitute of water and vegetation, excepting a few thorny shrubs and
            cacti. Before leaving California, I take this occasion to acknowledge the favors
            rendered to the Boundary Commission by the officers of the United States army in
            California. To General Hitchcock, for the facilities afforded me in my journey to the
            Geysers, and for an escort of twenty-five men to the Pimo villages. To Lieutenant Eddy,
            Commissary of Subsistence at San Diego, for provisions furnished us during our stay in
            the country, and for our homeward journey, as well as for various acts of kindness and
            attention shown to the members of the Commission. Also to Colonel J. Bank- head
            Magruder, commanding at San Diego. To this gentleman in particular, both personally and
            in behalf of the government, I feel under the deepest obligation. At a time when we were
            left without a carpente or blacksmith, and when none could be procured, this officer
            permitted me to send to his mechanics my wagons for repairs, and my animals to be shod,
            without which aid I could not have left San Diego. In other ways he was of great service
            to me and the Commis- sion, both during our stay in the country, and while preparing for
            the journey before us. i I • mk •- I i 4 FIFTH DIVISION. SAN DIEGO TO EL PASO, ALONG THE

            San Diego, and encamped some six miles distant near the Mission ; where there was good
            grazing, and where the animals had been chiefly kept since our arrival They were now
            busily in completing the preparations necessary before setting out on so long and
            difficult a journey as 110 BAN DIEGO TO that before us. It was quite doubtful whether we
            should have sufficient means of transportation ; and to make sure of this, all the
            provisions, tents, instruments, personal baggage, etc., were sent out to the camp. Here
            they were separated and weighed, or an estimate made, so as to enable us to judge
            whether our two wagons and twenty pack-mules would be sufficient. Uncertain how long we
            should be in reaching El Paso, we took seventy days' rations; in addition to which were
            a quantity of medical stores and anti-scorbutics, including fruits, vegetables, pickles,
            etc., as these important arti- cles were not to be procured on the way. I was ill at
            this time with fever and ague, and thought it most prudent to remain in quarters until
            the parties had got ready to move, and in fact had passed to a considerable distance
            into the interior, beyond the reach of the fogs and humid atmosphere of the coast. On
            the 26th, they commenced their march, intending to stop at Santa Isabel, fifty-six miles
            distant, where I was to join them. Several days before this, I sent off twelve head of
            beef-cattle belonging to the Commission, with an escort of six soldiers, with orders to
            remain at Fort Yuma until my arrival. This plan was recommended to me, as the cattle
            could not keep up with us after reaching the great desert ; and when they entered upon
            that much dreaded region, it was thought best that they should not stop, but keep on day
            and night until water was reached. A number of cattle were sent at the same time to
            supply the garrison at Fort Yuma. For my journey, I had provided myself with a small
            wagon to be drawn by two mules, and a fine American V, ALAMO MUCHO. Ill I horse, which
            had been ridden across the country by Mr. Gray. All the other members of the Commission,
            as also the laborers, servants,' cooks, and arrieros, were provided with mules, which
            experience had shown to be best for long journeys. They endure fatigue better than
            horses, will thrive where horses will starve, and in case of accident or emergency, may
            be used to carry burdens or be harnessed to a team. It was with con- siderable
            difficulty that I could procure good mules here ; and for those that I obtained, I paid
            from seven- ty-five to one hundred dollars each. Nearly every thing we had, including
            the tents, was new, our former equipments having been to a great extent abandoned on the
            journey out, as the animals failed, or as they had become past restoring, from eighteen
            months' use, and constant exposure to a dry heat, rain, or snow. On the 26th of May, T
            left San Diego, in company with Dr. Webb, in my small wagon, drawn by two niules. These
            excellent animals, I must observe, were the same that I started with from the coast of
            Texas in September, 1850. They had served me in my rapid journey to El Paso, and three
            times back and forth from that place to the Copper Mines. They had drawm my carriage in
            my first journey to Sonora, and subse- quently, with four others, brought a loaded wagon
            from the Copper Mines to San Diego. Notwithstanding these journeys and their constant
            use since we had been la California, they were in as fine condition as when they left
            the shores of the Atlantic. My wagon was pretty heavily laden ; and ere we had got a
            mile beyond San Diego, in turning aside for a train, it ran into a gully with such force
            as to spring 112 SAN DIEGO TO I the wooden axle-tree and bend the iron one. The injury
            did not appear to be serious ; and as the road, though hilly, was very good, we hastened
            on. But this little accident, trifling as it seemed at first, proved a constant source
            of annoyance to us throughout the J ourney. Ten miles from San Diego, is Soledad hill,
            which is very steep and difficult 'to pass. One of our loaded wagons had upset here a
            few days before. The whole country hereabouts is hilly, and destitute of trees, except
            in the small valleys, where the accumulation of water after rains has sustained a few
            mezquit trees. The hills on both sides, and as far as the eye can reach, are covered
            with a thick growth of wild oats. Several families have lately settled here, who make a
            profitable business of cutting these oats and carrying them to market at San Diego,
            where they are in good demand. all In the afternoon, we reached San Pasqual River, a sm
            and limpid stream, running through a rich valley covered with fine grass, and in which
            hundreds of cat- tle were grazing. About a mile in advance, we saw a large rancho, to
            which we directed our course, having been invited to pass the night there. This was the
            hacienda of Mrs. Snooks, a California lady, the widow of an Englishman, who now resides
            at San Diego. Word having been sent to the family occupying the rancho that I would stop
            here, we met with a hospitable reception, and were provided with an excellent supper and
            beds. This was formerly one of the largest stock- raising establishments in the country;
            but the higli price of cattle at San Francisco has induced the owner to drive them
            thither for sale. There were, however, siuh -f 1 J ALAMO MUCHO. 113 many hundreds
            remaining. The distance to San Diego is called tliirtj*six miles. San Pasqiial was the
            scene of an action between the United States troops and those of Mexico during the late
            war. Our army was at one time in a perilous situation, from which it was relieved by
            assistance sent by Commodore Stockton, then at San Diego.- I add in a note Colonel
            Kearney's brief report of this affair. "' May 2dt7L At seven o'clock, we took leave of

            the Gen- eral thus proceeds : "As the day (December 6) dawned, we approached the enemy
            at San Pasqual, who was already in the saddle, when Captain Johnston made a furious
            charge upon them with his advanced guard, and was in a short time after supported by the
            dragoons, soon after which the enemy gave way, having kept up from the beginning a
            continual fire upon us. Upon the retreat of the enemy, Captain Moore led off ra- pidly
            in pursuit, accompanied by the dragoons mounted on horses, and was followed, though
            slowly, by the others on their tired mules. .The nemy, well mounted, and among the best
            h6rsemeu in the world, after retreating about half a mile, and seeing an interval
            between Captain Moore with his advance and the drao-oons cominr to his support, ral-
            lied their whole force, charged with their lances, and, on account of their greatly
            superior numbers, but few of us in front remained un- touched. For five minutes they
            held the ground from us, when our «ien coming up, we again drove them, and they fled
            from the field not to return to it, which we occupied and encamped upon. A most mel-
            VOL. n.~8 114 SAN DIEGO TO along the valley near the river, we reached, in six miles,
            the ludian villanje of San Pasqual, consisting of forty or fifty rude huts of mud,
            grass, and poles. A few patches of ground seemed to be cultivated; but, ancholy: duty
            now remains for rae : it is to report the deatli of my aide- de-camp, Captain Jolmston,
            who was shot dead at the commencement of the action ; of Captain Moore, who -was lanced
            just previous to the final retreat of the enemy ; and of Lieutenant Hammond, also
            lanced, and who survived but a few hours. We had also killed, two sergeants, two
            corporals, and ten privates of the First Dragoons, one private of Volunteers, and one
            man attached to the Topographical Department. Among the wounded are myself (in two
            places), Captain Gillespie, ana Caj)tain Gibson, of the Volunteers ; one sergeant, one
            bugler, and nine privates of the Dragoons; many of them receiving from two to ten lance
            wounds, most of them when unhorsed, and incapable of resistance. Our howitzers were not
            brought into action ; but coming to the front at the close of it, before they were
            turned so as to admit of being nrecl eipon the retreating enemy, the two mules before
            one of thep got -alarmed, and, freeing themselves from their drivers, ran off among tlie
            .aemy, and were thus lost to us. The enemy proved to be a party ot about one hundred and
            sixty Californians, under Andreas Pico, brother of the late Governor. The number of
            their dead must have been con- siderable ; though I have no means of ascertaining how
            many, as just -previous to their final retreat they carried off all excepting six. Tn
            great number of killed and wounded proves that our officers and men have fully sustained
            the high character and reputation of our troops, :and the victory thus gained over more
            than double our force may - •sist in forming the wreath of our national glory. I have to
            return niy ! thanks to many for their gallantry and good conduct on the ficlci, :
            particularly to Captain Turner, First Dragoons, and to Lieutenant Emory, Topographical
            Engineers, who were active in performance o their duties in conveying orders from me to
            the command. "On the momins; of the seventh, havino- made ambulances for our wounded and
            interred the dead, we proceeded on our march, when the enemy showed himself, occupying
            the hills in our front, which tlie left as we approached, till reaching San Bernardo, a
            party of them too I i ALAMO MUCHO. 115 on the whole, the place bore a miserable
            appearance. Few Indians were seen, as they were still indulging in sleep. Crossing tlie
            San Pasqual River again, we reached the base of the hill, or rather mountain, of the
            same possession of a bill near to it, and maintained tlieir position till attacked by
            our advance, who quickly drove them from it, killing and wounding five of their number,
            with no loss on bur part. • "On account of our wounded men, and upon the report of the
            sur- geon that rest was necessary for them, we remained at this place till the morning
            of the 11th, when Lieutenant Gray, of the navy, in com- mand of a party of sailors and
            marines, sent out from San Diego by Commodore Stockton, joined us. We proceeded at ten
            a. m., the enemy no longer showing himself, and on the 12th we reached this place ; and
            I have now to oifer my thanks to Commodore Stockton, and all of his gallant commandj for
            the very many kind attentions we have received and continue to receive, from them. "

            Tour in Callfornixi, 116 SAX DIEGO TO name, the terror of all travellers when
            accompanied by wagons. We had heard much of this hill, and fully prepared to undertake
            the labor of cr it To keep our seats in the wagon was out of the question ; so we all
            got out, and literally put our shoulders to the wheels. The driver, while he held the
            reins, braced up the wagon to prevent its upset- ting, and Dr. Webb and myself
            alternately pushed behind or chocked the wheels. The mules tugged with all their
            strength, and we moved steadily thougn slowly on, stopping every forty or fifty feet to
            let the animals rest. The road pursued a zig-zag course, windino- alonsr the side and
            around the hill, .which O ""tJ somewhat lessened the difficulty of the ascent. But the
            steepness was not the greatest difficulty to en- counter. This consisted in the "
            sidling" places, where the wagon could not stand upright, and required to be held up
            with ropes while ascending or descending- Then, again, portions of the road were very
            rocky, and much gullied by running water. Occasionally there was a cessation of hills,
            and a short piece of good road ; but then soon came descents, which were at- tended with
            more trouble than the ascents; for the wheels had to be locked, and the wagon held up
            witt ropes. In this way we journeyed the whole day with little variation. San Pasqual
            forms part of a high mountain ridge running north and south. From its summit we had a
            fine view of the surrounding country, though lesser hills extended far along its base. I
            have n* doubt that a closer reconnoissance of the country woi make known a more
            practicable route than this, ALAMO MUCHO. 117 ding sucli a frightful mountain. It
            enougli for pack-mules, for wliicli I presume it' was constructed; but it was never
            attempted to be passed with wagons until Colonel Cooke crossed it in 1847. A variety of
            trees and shrubbery grow along the road, with the greatest abundance and variety of wild
            flowers, for the most part, as is usual in this country, of brilliant colors. The long
            descent from this mountain, after the higher portions had been passed, was comparatively
            easy. We then reached valleys covered with live-oaks, and affording an abundance of
            grass. Next, several hills, with o d patches of woodland, were passed, until we reached
            Santa Isabel. When within a couple of miles of this place my mules began to show the
            effects of their toilsome day's jour- ney, and the wagon was nearly disabled. Fearing
            they would not get in, I took my servant's mule and hastened on to our camp, which I
            reached at seven o'clock, and sent two fresh mules back to the assist- ance of my party.
            Soon after Dr. Webb came in, and reported that the axle-tree had given out, and the
            wagon could proceed no further; so that it was neces- sary to send pack-mules to bring
            in its contents, and also provisions for the men. I now took possession of my tent with
            its appurtenances, and sat down to an (Excellent supper, prepared in anticipation of my
            com- ing. It was pleasing to find myself once more in a tent for the first time since I
            was taken ill at Ures. It Was invariably the case, that we all enjoyed better health
            when in camp and on our march, than when shut up in quarters with little or nothing to
            do. An 118 SAN DIEGO TO active, moving life in the open air always brings with it a good
            appetite and sound sleep, and is the surest antidote to, or rather preventive of,
            disease. Distance travelled to-day, twenty-two miles. I found my party encamped a mile
            beyond the Indian village of Santa Isabel, in one of the most lovely groves of large
            branching oaks that it had ever been our fortune to meet with. It is closely hemmed in
            on three sides by high hills, all of which are thickly wooded, while a clear mountain
            stream passes directly through' ili. Grass in abundance grew all around us, on which our
            mules were luxuriating. The tents were all pitched beneath trees, and but a few feet
            from the stream to which I have alluded. Soon after I arrived, Colonel Craig, commander
            of tile escort, called and reported his men ready for our march. He had been furnished
            by Colonel Magru- der with sis additional soldiers, who were to accom- pany us to Fort
            Yuma. Lieutenant Whipple was occupied during the evening in taking astronomical
            observations, as the weather was now clear and plea- sant, a very perceptible change
            having taken place since we left the coast. Soon after the train had left its camp near
            the Mis- sion of San Diego, it was reported to me by Mr. Thur- ber (who acted as
            Quarter-Master in addition to his other duties), that another wagon would be absolutely
            necessary. I accordingly directed that he should send Mr. Leroux at once to the Mormon
            settlement at San Bernardino, about a hundred miles distant, to purchase a wagon from
            some of the recently arrived emigrants, and should await his return at Santa Isabel. Mr.
            Leroiix, ALAMO MUCHO. 119 who but a short time previous had been to that place, and knew
            manj of the Mormons, set oif on his errand. May dOtJi. Remained in camjD. Got my wagon
            in, and made a new wooden axle-tree. Found the iron portion much bent and very weak.
            Lashed the two strongly together with rawhide. Santa Isabel is an Indian village, and
            was once a place of some note, when the missionary establishments were in the
            ascendancy. A roofless church and a few miserable huts, are now all that remain.
            Nevertheless, the inhabitants cultivate the soil, and by means of irri- gation, which
            they well understand, raise wheat, maize, pumpkins, and beans. The vine succeeds very
            well here, and was formerly cultivated to a considerable ex- tent. The land near is very
            fertile, which had .induced some Americans to select it for their homes. The long
            neglected fields were being turned up, which gave the valley a pleasant appearance.
            Several of the In- dians, who belong to the Diegeno tribe, visited our camp to-day. They
            were dressed in their holiday clothes, such as red and white shirts ; while the chief,
            Tomaso, who seemed an intelligent man, wore an old coat trimmed with silver lace, which
            had once belonged to some Mexican officer. May 3lst Remained in camp. In the afternoon
            Mr. Leroux returned, accompanied by a wagon, wliich was driven by its owner, a Mormon,
            named Smithson. After paying him, I invited him to remain with ght, as he had had a
            fatiguing day's journey T\ were much amused during the evening in listening to the
            history of our Mormon friend, who also enlightened us with a lecture on the peculiar
            doctrines of his sect. 120 SAN DTEGO TO ■ He seemed a harmless, though zealous man,
            ardent in his religious belief, and was I should think, a fair spe- cimen of his
            fraternity. His people had lately pur- chased the extensive haciendas and buildings at
            Sau Bernardino, covering several miles square, for seventy thousand dollars, one half of
            which amount they had paid in cash. This is one of the richest agricultural districts in
            the State, and is said to have been a great bargain. June 1st In consequence of the
            heat, I deferred leaving until 6 o'clock in the evenino;. As the party was now got
            together, I give the names of those com- posing it. John R. Bartlett, Commissioner.

            This party had both wagons and pack-mules as well as myself; and all, both officers and
            attendants, were mounted on mules or horses. Lieut. Colonel L. S. Craig commanded the
            escort, now reduced by desertion to five men of his own com- mand, with a detail of ten
            men from that of Colonel Magruder, at San Diec?o. The entire party embraced six wagons,
            twenty -five pack-mules, and about fifty officers and men, mounted. June 1st The day
            being very hot, we did not strike our tents and leave camp until 6 o'clock, p. m., when
            Colonel Craig and myself led the way. The road was very good along the valley where it
            was level ; but there were many deep gullies, which required the use of ropes to keep
            the wagons in an erect position. Our course had been north-east. The scene changed as we
            passed around the spur of the ridge which bounded the eastern part of the valley. Here a
            broad plain opened us, with but few trees, althouscli well covered with grass. Our
            course now lay south-east. The moon rose remarkably bright ; and, with a cool and
            comfort- able night, we "jogged steadily along and made good progress. Towards midnight
            we entered a thick grove 122 SAN DIEGO TO of oaks, which so closely lined the road, that
            it was with some difficulty that we found our way through them. It was a beautiful spot
            for an encampment, and we felt quite disposed to stop; but we knew of no water near. The
            grass, too, was quite sparse. We there- pushed on to the Indian village of San Felip ped
            at 2 o'clock in the morning I immediately threw myself down and enjoyed a dehglit- ful
            sleep, such as none can appreciate but those who have tried a camp life. Distance
            travelled, twenty- eight miles. June 2d. Found ourselves in a valley without woods, in
            the lower part of which was a marshy spot with pools of water. Early in the morning our
            tents were thronged with Indians, who appeared to belong to the Diegeno tribe. They were
            a filthy looking set, clad and apparently half starved. D many men and women wading
            about the marsh d seeds: of which nd acorns, their principal food consists. The women
            seemed to be the chief laborers, the men lounging about the camp most of the day. The
            improvidence of this people seems almost incomprehensible. A very little exertion would
            have repaid them with all the wheat, maize, and vegetables, required for their sub-
            sistence. To these they might add a few cattle, which, in this country, may be obtained
            for a mere trifle from the ranches, whose increase in this fine val- ley would give them
            a plentiful supply of meat. As n is, they have neither corn nor meat, and spend ten
            times as much labor in collecting the roots, seeds, and other wretched food they live
            on, as would be necessary ty ALAMO MUCHO. 123 cultivating the soil to produce bread,
            fruits, and meats in abundance. Their village consists of twenty-three miserable old
            huts or wigwams built of straw and rushes. Some were covered with raw hides of various
            colors. A few small patches of ground were cultivated, not exceeding alto- gether a
            couple of acres. This was not for the want of land, as there are many hundred acres of
            good land around them, which by irrigation could be made very fertile. From appearances
            near the village, I was led / to believe that there had long been a settlement here,
            there being not only traces of former buildings in every direction, but also of acequias
            or trenches for irrigating the lands. At 4 p. M. struck our tents. The road continued
            good for six or seven miles, its course still south-east. The grass had now disappeared,
            and the thorny chap- poral Vvdiich had taken its place was the first indica- tion that
            we were passing into a desert region. We now entered a canon, or mountain pass, caused,
            like most others, by the action of running water for ages. This pass had been used only
            for mules, until Colonel Cooke entered the country with wagons. Not being able to get
            through, he was obliged to come to a halt, and open a passage with axes and hammers
            through the solid rock, a work of great labor. This defile consists of perpendicular
            walls of rock about fifteen feet high, and of a width barely sufficient for wagons to
            pass. In its bed are large masses of rock reaching to the axle-trees. At the narrowest
            point one of our wagons stuck fast ; but after taking out the mules, by dint of lifting
            and prying, we at length 124 SAN DIEGO TO got through. The space here was but Uvo inches
            wider than the axle-trees of the wagons. There were, also, several steep and rocky
            descents where the wheels had to be locked, and the wagons held back with ropes. This
            pass was not less than three miles in length ; and should two trains meet here, it would
            prove a serious business for both. The descent into the valley beyond, continued gradual
            for several miles ; but at length our course was stopped by a bold rocky hill running
            directly across it. This we ascended, over a very bad road ; but bad as it was, it was
            better than the descent, which was the most perfect break-neck place that a wagon ever
            attempted to pass. It was exceedingly steep, filled with large loose rocks, with an
            occasional perpendicular leap ot three or four feet. I feared that our wagons would not
            hold together, even if they escaped being upset But the only accident that happened, was
            the breaking of our two remaining barometers, a very serious one for the meteorological
            observations. At the bottomof this hill, we continued for five or six miles through a
            valley, with no other vegetation than the usual desert plants and cacti, accompanied by
            the great agave which seemed to luxuriate in this bar- renness. At 11 o'clock, p. M., we
            reached VuIIgcM eighteen miles from San Felipe, where we pitched our tents among some
            willows. June M. Vallecita, as its name indicates, is a little valley, surrounded by
            lofty and barren mountains- Pools of sulphurous water are found among the wiH bushes,
            but not a tree was to be seen. The grass, too, had changed, having here a wiry
            character. A depot oi ALAMO MUCHO. 125 provisions is kept at this place, witli a file of
            soldiers, for the supply of Fort Yuma, and of government trains passing and repassing. A
            few horses are also kept here, to facilitate the communication between Fort Yuma and San
            Diego. The distance between those places is about two hundred and twenty-five miles, and
            Yallecita is about half way. Beyond it, towards the Colorado, there is little or no
            grass ; so that trains, after they have crossed the desert, usually stop a day or two
            here, to recruit their animals. A band of Diegeno Indians live here, to whom the arrival
            of a train is an event of some importance. They made their appearance early this
            morning, dressed in their holiday clothes, and appeared more cleanly than any Indians we
            had seen. Nearly all wore clean white or fancy calico shirts, their only garment ;
            pantaloons being regarded by all Indians as useless articles of dress. These people were
            formerly connected with the Missions, and hence call themselves Christians ; but they
            now live in a most degraded state of indo- lence and poverty. They cultivate beans and
            pump- kins, and pick up an occasional mule, which serves them for food ; though their
            main reliance is upon the acorns, which they collect and store up in large baskets for
            winter use. The labor of preparing them for food is, like almost all other labor,
            performed by the women, who were to be seen in front of every hut wielding their heavy
            stone pestles. When the acorns are re- duced to flour, it is washed to remove the bitter
            taste, 7 and then cooked into a kind of gruel, or made into hread. These Indians were
            very attentive to us, bring- ing us wood (which is very scarce here) and water, 126 SAN
            DIEGO TO and othenYise assisting about the camp. They seemed amply repaid with a few old
            clothes, or any fragments of food that remained .from our tables. Our culinary
            department was always the great point of attraction to these poor creatures, who would
            often form a double circle around the camp-fires, much to the annoyance of the cook. The
            weather was excessively hot to-day, the mercury standing at 105" Fahrenheit in the shade
            under the bushes. Took our departure, at 6 p. 3i. Each mile we advanced, grew more
            barren. The road contmued through deep sand or loose gravel, reminding us that we had
            fairly entered upon the desert of which we had heard so much. On leaving this valley,
            all traces of grass disappear. A few stunted shrubs armed with thorns, strove hard for
            an existence ; and the wonder is, that any vegetable life can flourish amid such bar-
            renness. But the cacti and agave seem to dehght in such arid and desert refrions, as
            thouorh the intense heat and dry atmosphere were the vivifying influences that nourish
            them. The bleached bones and dried carcasses of oxen, mules, and sheep, began to mark
            our road, mementos of the sufferings of former parties. The moon still shone bright,
            while we journeyed slowly on through the heavy sand for twenty miles, till, at one
            o'clock in the mornino:, we arrived at Carrizo Creek. I had got considerably in advance
            of the wagons, ana without waiting for them or my tent, stretched rayseli on the bare
            earth (for it was so warm that a covering was unnecessary), and was soon lost in sleep.

            regions. It rises in the very centre of barrenness, flows for about a mile, and is again
            absorbed by the 'desert. It has "vvorn for itself a bed about fifteen feet below the
            plain. It is from three to nine inches in depth, and varies from six feet to as many
            yards in width. Where the banks have been washed away, it receives, in several places,
            accessions from springs ; but when these cease, the stream grows less and less, until it
            is all absorbed by the sands. In the ravine or bed formed by this water, mezquit bushes
            grow to the height of ten or twelve feet, the deep green of their foliage ]3resenting a
            pleasing contrast with the desola- tion around, and marking the course of the stream
            from its beginning to its end. The grass, which gro\ in a few patches, in little nooks
            which receive their moisture from the creek, is very coarse and wiry ; and of this there
            is not enough to supply the few passing trains that come this way. The heat here to-day
            was insupportable, the mercury ranging at 114° in the shade. The rays of the sun beat
            through our tents, so that we could not remain in them. Some retreated beneath the
            wagons ; while myself and others found our way into little gullies or ravines beneath
            the clay banks, where, partly sheltered by the banks and partly by bushes, we passed the
            day. We had much trouble here with our mules, who did not like the coarse grass i3efore
            them ; so that while the herders thought that they were quietly trying to pick up a
            living on the margin of the stream, they were off at full speed for Yallecita, where
            they had a recol- lection of better fare. . Some were arrested in their 128 SAX DIEGO TO
            flight within a few miles of camp, while others were not overtaken until they had
            reached the grassy patches they were in search of This is a common habit with mules, and
            often impedes the progress of a train. I have known them, where the grass was poor, to
            retrace their steps twenty-five miles for the sake of finding better. Experience showed
            us that in such places as this the animals must be closely watched, and at night . tied
            up to the wagons. ■ We noticed a peculiarity in the water here, which was that, although
            sweet, it did not quench the thirst. We all drank incessantly without being satisfied.
            As we entered the great desert here, and expected to find no water, except by digging,
            until we reached the Colorado, one hundred miles distant, we filled all our kegs,
            canteens, empty bottles, and every thing else that would hold water. I then directed the
            waconsto be loaded, the mules packed, and the train to move at sunset. I have forgotten
            to mention that we saw along the banks of Carrizo Creek, near our camp, an innumera- ble
            quantity of the bones and dried carcasses of sheep, a rare occurrence in a region
            infested by hungry wolves ; but numerous and hungry as the wolves are, there is such a
            thing as satiating their appetites, and of this we had an example before our eyes. Here
            were the bodies of many thousands of sheep lying P within the space of a hundred yards.
            This wholesale mortality is said to have been caused by their eating of a poisonous
            plant ; but as we could find no specimens ot such a plant, we believed that the poor
            creatures, after traversing the desert and being- probably three or four ALAMO MUCHO.
            129 days without water, had dtunk themselves to death. Most of the bodies were in the
            immediate vicinity of the stream. It was not until half-past seven o'clock, p. m,, that
            we moved from camp. The road continued heavy through loose sand and stones, making it
            impossible to move more than two miles an hour. Six or seven miles brought us to a steep
            sand hill, which no team alone could ascend.' Ten mules were accordingly hitched to each
            wagon, when by dint of tugging, and a good deal of beating and hard swearing, the poor
            animals reached the summit with their loads. One of Colonel Craig's wagons was upset and
            rolled over and over to the bottom of the hill, but fortunately escaped with no other
            damage than that of smashing the medi- cine chest ; which, however, was a loss we
            afterwards severely felt. This was the most desolate spot we had seen, pre- senting
            indeed the very climax of barrenness. We were surrounded in all directions by hills of
            clay, their sides cut into deep ravines. As far as the eye could reach by the light of
            the moon, which rose at ten o clock, not a sign of vegetation appeared. I believe there
            had not been a day, from the time of our landing on the coast of Texas till we trod the
            shores of the broad Pacific, that we had not seen the mezquit in some form, or the
            common prickly pear. Here they could not exist. June 5th. Reached the water-holes called

            for us on our arrival ; but as they were ignorant of the place and were unfamiliar with
            the best indications of water, they had accomplished little. Some more expe- rienced
            hands now set themselves busily at work m an arroyo, or place where there was a slight
            depression m the desert, marked by some mezquit bushes, whose freshness showed that
            water sometimes reached their roots. After digging about six feet, the water began
            slowly to enter ; and by dipping it up with a basin, we managed to supply our animals.
            The desert where we were now encamped, is an open and remarkably level plain, with
            scarcely an undulation. On the south-west, twenty miles distant, is a range of lofty
            mountains, which forms its limit in that direction. On the north and east, it is bounded
            by the horizon, no mountains or hills being visible. The soil is either a fine gravel,
            or loose sand. The vegetation is exceedingly sparse, consisting chiefly ot stunted
            mezquit and the larrea Mexicana. Near the arroyo, where water sometimes finds its way, a
            few mezquit bushes have attained the height of ten feet, whose brilliant hue is most
            agreeable to the eye, amid so much barrenness. A little grass was found in clumps about
            a mile from our camp in an arroyo, whither our animals were sent. This, with the young
            shoots of the mezquit, was all they had. At sunrise this morn- ing, the mercury stood at

            government, having left EI Paso del Norte on* the 19th February. He came by way of
            Chihua- hua and Mazatlan ; and had encountered serious ob- stacles on his route. As
            there was no party coming across the country by the Gila route, he was obliged to pass

            a journey of twelve hours without a moment's rest, in which time we tad made forty-five
            miles. In long marches like this with pack-mules, it is not considered advisable to stop
            ; for no rest can be given to the animals without relieving them of their packs, to do
            which and replace them would require at least two hours. If a pack- tram stops without
            relieving the mules of their bur- iens, the animals lie down and attempt to roll, an
            operation which disarranges the packs and often does 134 ALAMO MUCHO TO mucli injury.
            When there is grass and water, it is well, on long marches by daylight, to rest an hour
            or two during the heat of the day. Feed and water at such times, with rest from their
            loads, affords much relief; but when there is nothing to offer the weary animals, it is
            decidedly the best course to hasten on and complete the journey, unless it is too long
            to be accomplished in a day. The desert here is a vast open plain, extending as "W'ell
            at Alamo Mucho. far the eye can reach on every sid on the south-west, where a chain of
            mountains appears some FORT YUMA. 135 thirty or forty miles distant. The undulations are
            few and slight. Near our camp was a steep bank about sixt} feet high, extending for
            miles, and descending to a great depression or basin, which appears to have been the bed
            of a lake. It was in this bed that the wells or pits were sunk from which we obtained
            water. About twenty-five miles back from this place we crossed a ravine or arroyo some
            twenty or thirty feet wide, and about ten feet below the surface of the desert, that
            forms the bed of what is known as the "New River." Three or four years ago, this ravine
            was filled with Water, as well as a large basin connected with it. The water suddenly
            appeared here, and by passing emigrants was hailed as a miracle and direct interposition
            of Divine Providence, like the manna furnished to the Israelites of old. This phenomenon
            is now well known to proceed from the Colorado River, which some years rises to a great
            height, overflowing its banks and the adjacent valley, and sometimes running back
            through lagoons and depressions in the desert for man} miles. It was one of these great
            risings of the river that caused the sudden appearance of the mysterious "New River" of
            the desert, which remained two years, and then dried up. By similar inundations the
            great basin at Alamo Mucho has doubtless been, and may again be, filled. I was .told by
            persons in' California who had crossed this desert, that they had found pools of
            brackish water several miles from the road. These I presume to be deeper basins, where
            the water stands longer than in the "New River" or the dry basins passed by us. • ' 136
            • ALAMO MUCHO TO On the table-land or plain of the desert the vege- tation is scanty,
            consisting of dwarfish mezquit and larrea. In the basin near us were patches of grass,
            which, with the young twigs of the mezquit bushes, formed the food of our animals. In
            certain portions of the desert it is extremely annoying to travellers when the wind
            blows, as clouds of sand then fill the atmosphere- When one of our parties crossed it in
            January, they were overtaken by one of these storms, from which they suffered greatly,
            particularly as their animals had perished, and they were forced to traverse it on foot.
            Within two hours after my arrival, others of the party who were mounted came in, and
            among them Mr. Malcolm Seaton, who reported to me that about break of day the train had
            fallen in with the two Sweeney ) that Colonel Craig, having at once recognised them by
            their dress and muskets, spoke to them, and asked them where they were going. They
            replied, to Yalle- cito. The Colonel told them he knew they were deserters from Fort
            Yuma, and advised them to return with him. After parleying a while, they told him they
            would not return; that they were desperate, and would shoot any one. who attempted to
            arrest them. €olonel Craig called for Sergeant Quin, of his com- mand, and Sergeant
            Bale, the non-commissioned officer sent with the men furnished by Colonel Magruder. Mr.
            Seaton then left, under the impression that Colo- nel Craig would succeed in persuading
            the deserters to return with him. Besides the soldiers with the train, there were twenty
            or more men on whom the ± FORT YUMA. 137 Colonel could have called, had he deemed their
            aid necessary As the wasrons besran to lasr, Mr. Seaton o d G hastened on to camp. About
            an hour after, Sergeant Quin rode into camp, his hat gone, and in a great state of
            excite- ment. He stated, that soon after he and Sergeant train, according to Colonel
            Craig's Bale had left the orders, they came uj) with the two deserters; where- upon the
            latter halted, and declared they would go no further, but must settle the .business on
            the spot. Colonel Craig again expostulated with them, and used every argument to induce
            th'em to surrender themselves, and return with him to Fort Yuma, in vain. The Colonel
            told them who he was, but and said that, if a return to the Fort was so re- pugnant to
            them, he would endeavor to have them assigned to his command, in which event they might
            accompany the Commission. lie then dis- mounted from his mule and handed his revolver to

            unprotected by a tree or bush, and exposed to a more oppressive heat than we had ever
            before experienced. As there was but little grass to be found, I caused the last of our
            corn and oats to be distributed to the animals, giving about two quarts to each.
            Disasters seldom, come alone ; and to add to the misfortunes of the day, Jesus Ortiz,
            one of the team- sters, came in and reported that the tire of one of the wheels having
            come off, his wagon had broken down, ,and in this disabled condition he had left it
            twelve miles back. As his mules were perishing for water, he had hastened on with them.
            ■ After the animals had been watered and had grazed for an hour on the straggling tufts
            of grass and mezquit bushes, I dispatched a party back with an empty wagon, to bring
            forward the contents of the broken one. They returned during the evening, and reported
            that the fore wheel was completely demolished and past repairing, and that the wagon
            could not be used without another Avheel. They also reported that they had seen seven
            Indians, who kept at a distance, but followed them for several miles. In the afternoon,
            Mr. Johnson and an express rider arrived from Fort Yuma, and remained several hours to
            rest and water their animals. They were bound for San Diego. On hearing of the disaster
            to our wagon, they informed me, that about seven miles in advance we should find a wagon
            in good order, which liad lately been abandoned, and with which we could replace our
            disabled one. This was very welcome iews to me ; for we were not in a condition to lose
            a 1 A 140 ALAMO MUCHO TO o of our journey. I therefor out a party with mules in search,
            which soon after returned, bringing with them a very good vehicle. Disasters of this
            kind are of common occurrence on the desert, where mules give out or perish. One of our
            own wagons, in excellent order, was thus abandoned by the party which crossed here in
            January, and was soon after made a prize of Two years previous to our crossing the
            desert, when a large number of emi- grants went over it to California, I was told that
            more than a hundred good wagons, with harness, pack-sad- dles, and a vast quantity of
            camp equipage, were scat- tered along the road. Many of these were subse- quently taken
            away by parties from the settlements, who came out for them with fresh animals ; while
            others were broken up and used for fuel, or parts taken to restore the injured ones.
            Such was the eventful day of the 6th of June, with the heat at 108° Fahrenheit. We
            pitched our tents, and rolled up the sides to catch a little air : but it was d seemed
            as thouerh om a heated bower, about three feet high, made of bushes, and covered with
            raw hides, into which I crept, and passed the day. This retreat had been constructed by
            Captain Davidson, who the week before our arrival had been here fi Fort Yuma for the
            purpose of opening a well. June 7fh. In camp at Alamo Mucho. Remained as quiet as
            possible, moving only from my tent to my little bower. The men were occupied in
            enlarging the well, as it required much time to dip up the water, which was done with a
            bucket. The supply FORT YUMA. 141 was barely sufficient for the demand, which, in conse-
            quence of the great heat, was constant both for man and animals. The thermometer stood
            at 106. At two o'clock in the afternoon, Dr. Webb and his party returned, bringing with
            them the dead body of Colonel Craig. They did not reach the scene of action until nearly
            ten o'clock at night, owing to the heavi- ness of the road, and the wearied condition of
            their animals. They then had much difficulty in finding the body, it being more than a
            mile from the spot to which they had been directed by the sergeant. After dividing, and
            searching in various directions, they formed a line from the road, placing men at such
            dis- tances from each other that the intervening spaces could be carefully observed. In
            this manner they at length met with tracks, which finally led them to a spot where the
            Colonel's loose riding coat was found. Soon after they came to his hat, and finally to
            his corpse, which was discovered extended on the ground, and carefully covered with a
            blanket; "The scene," says the Doctor, in his rejort to me, " was a sad and sicken- ing
            one, and produced a strong sensation upon all present, and particularly on the Colonel's
            body ser- vant. It was evident from appearances that the Colo- nel did not long survive
            the wound inflicted, or expe- I'lence much, if any, severe suffering. "The ground around
            was as undisturbed as though he had laid himself down to rest, and compos- edly gone to
            sleep. Had he lingered long in the exposed situation where he was, there being neither
            tree nor shrub to afford shelter, his sufferings, as the 8«n got high in the heavens,
            would have been extreme » 142 ALAMO MUCHO TO independent of what he might have undergone
            from the wound. a Not many feet distant," continues Dr. Webb, II we saw the dead body of
            Sergeant Bale's horse, which had been perforated by a musket ball. The sergeant was
            nowhere to be found. I became satisfied that he had left the ground, probably without
            being mortally wounded. He had evidently, previous to his departure, taken his own
            blanket from the saddle, and with it covered the remains of the Colonel ; for men who
            would brutally murder a fellow being, it was not for a moment to be presumed would have
            the slightest regard for the appearance or protection of the mutilated relics. The
            corpse I caused to be carefully rolled up and placed in the ambulance ; and at three
            o'clock id the morning we mournfully commenced our return march. " After proceeding
            about ten miles on our way back, we noticed ahead of us a man reclining by the road side
            ; and on reachinsj him, much to my satisfac- ii. he proved to be the missing sergeant.
            When he joined the Colonel, he was told the pur pose for which he was summoned inquiry
            being addressed ; and he stated pon some of ready to obey orders, from his knowledge
            desperate character of the deserters, he was confident they would not be taken without
            bloodshed. How- ever, as already observed, the Colonel's feelings of kindness outweighed
            all apprehensions of danger, if b® entertained any, and overbalanced all regard for sen-
            protection. Having completely disarmed himself, and lessened his security still further

            fell ; and before the sergeant could disentangle himself from the trap- pings, the
            deserters caught hold of him, and wrenched away the revolver, but promised to inflict no

            intelligence to that place, Vallecito, Santa Isabel, etc., etc., relative to the
            probable fote of Colonel Craig, in oider that suitable measures might be taten to
            apprehend the deserters, should they present themselves there. As soon as the news was
            received by Colonel Magruder, command- ing at San Diego, he sent expresses to the
            various military posts and settlements, and aroused the Indians in Southern California,
            whereby he was enabled to establish a cordon across the country with a view of
            intercepting the murderers. The routes are so few, and the watering places so well
            known, that this object was easily attained. A reward, too, was offered the Indians, to
            induce them to thoroughly scour the country and prevent the escape of these men. It was
            not many days before a party of Indians engaged in this duty discovered two men with
            muskets ; and believing them to be the murderers, all but two concealed themselves. One
            of these Indians was a chief, an exceedingly shrewd man, who desired to secure his prize
            without bloodshed. They, there- fore, professed friendship for tbe men, and proposed to
            buy their muskets; an offer which the deserters gladly accepted, money being more impor-
            tant to them now than weapons. They were accordingly paid eight dol- lars each, and the
            cunning Indians thus became possessed of their arms. But one of the deserters being
            still in possession of a large revolver, it was necessary to disarm him of this before
            they could make sure of their pris- oners. The Chief, therefore, manifested a great
            curiosity as to this sin- gular weapon, and asked the man to let him examine it. Not
            suspect- ing the object of the Indian, Avho he supposed had never seen a re- volver
            before, he unhesitatingly handed it to him for inspection. The Chief no sooner had it in
            his possession, than he stepped back and pre- sented it to the breast of the deserter.
            The two Indians now gave the war-whoop ; whereupon the rest of the party, numbering some
            twelve or fourteen, sprang from their hiding-place, and at once surrounded the
            prisoners. They were conducted to the Mission of San Diego, and there surren- FOBT YUMA.

            was, therefore dug in the desert near our camp, and a few rods from the margin of the
            great basin. At sunset, when the mules had received their packs, the wagons had been
            loaded, and the party were ready to move, a proces- lent four read as formed, and the
            mortal remains of our excel- nd much beloved friend, borne upon a cot by oldiers, were

            should be tried by a military court martial or hy the ciyie courts, they were finally
            tried, condemned, and hanged at San Jiigo, in presence of a vast multitude, among which
            were many ndians. The murderers were both Englishmen, and are said to have leea

            officer of whom tlie army and the nation had just cause to feel proud. He entered the
            army from the love he felt for a soldier's life, and with- out the advantages which a
            military education at West Point is supposed to confer. Yet such was his devo- tion to
            his profession, such the skill he acquired in it, and such the bravery shown by him when
            called to" serve his country, that he soon attained the rank of captain, and was
            breveted Lieutenant Colonel for gal- lant service rendered at the battles of Cherubusco
            and Molino Del Eey. His whole soul was absorbed in his profession, and he spared no
            pains' to render his com- mand skilful in the use of their arms. He was always most
            punctilious in the discharge of duty ; and how- ever much his command was reduced by
            sickness or absence, he kept up his daily drills and parades with as much rigor and
            discipline as though an entire regi- ment were under his charge. Towards his men he
            manifested the interest of a father as well as that of a commander, and was greatly
            beloved by them in return. During the stay of the Commission at San Diego, when nearly
            all the officers attached to it took advan- tage of the necessary detention to visit
            other parts of California, he remained in camp with his men, nor did he leave them for a
            single day, even when desertion had reduced their number to five. It was a source of
            deep mortification to him, that men who had followed him through the severe campaigns of
            the Mexican war should desert him here, for the sake of pecuniary ad- vantage. His
            genuine kindness of heart, honesty oi purpose, and rigid adherence to duty, had won for

            among his brother officers.* At 8 o'clock in the evening we left camp, our hearts filled
            with sadness. Passed several wagons in good condition which had been abandoned by their
            owners, among them some large ones, which bore the letters U. S., showing, as we were
            afterwards told was the case, that they had belonged to government trains, the mules of
            which had perished. The whitened bones of animals marked the road in many places,
            terrors to pass- ing emigrants. At twelve o'clock the moon arose, before which time we
            had much difficulty in finding the road ; for so little was the desert travelled, that
            it was only by taking a star for our guide that we man- aged to keep in the right
            direction. I rode a mule all this night, and found it no easy matter to retain my seat
            in the saddle. 4f. Such, in fact, was the case with many I cannot refrain from relatincr
            an anecdote to show tliat Colonel Craigs kindness was extended to animals as well as his
            fellow beings. In our various marches across deserts, our animals often suffered much
            for want of water, and in consequence of the intense heat, required great attention.
            Notwithstanding the Colonel had men to take care of his horse, so fearful was he that he
            might not receive proper care, that at the close of a march he always accompanied his
            horse to the water (when it tvas to he had), and, after seeing the animal well washed
            and cleaned, would himself give him the luxury of a good sponging. The result was, his
            horse was always in fine condition, and without the ailments incident to constant use
            under the saddle in a hot climate. On one occasion when we made a long march, and
            encamped without water for the animals, and but a scanty supply for ourselves, a little
            was spared to the oflicers to wash themselves in the morning. The Colonel made a request
            to each of them, to refrain from using soap, that he might have the water they had used
            for his horse ; by which means he collected a gallon for the use of his favorite. ■ 148

            that fastening their mules to bushes, or to their legs, they lay down on the desert, and
            stole a few minutes' sleep. The road continued very sandy, and consequently very
            fatiguing to our jaded animals, which had had but little food for the last four days. As
            there was no necessity for keeping with the wagons, I hastened on with the pack-mules
            and several men who were mounted, and reached the next watering place, known as Cooke's
            Well, at six o'clock in the morning, having been ten hours in the saddle. The distance
            from our last camp, was twenty-eight miles. After some time, finding that neither the
            wagons nor my carretella (small wagon) came in, I sent back some of the pack-mules to
            their aid. ' But even with this assistance, they did not come up until three or four
            hours after my arri- val. % June Sfh. At Cooke's Well. On reaching here this morning, we
            were so much fatigued that we did not pitch our tents, but threw ourselves down on the
            bare sand beneath some mezquit trees, and were soon lost in sleep. The water obtained
            here was from a hole dug in the earth some ten or twelve feet deep, in a place about
            twenty feet lower than the general level of the desert. It had to be dipped up in a
            bucket, and passed to a second person midway towards the top, who emptied it into a
            basin on the surface, from which the animals drank. There was no grass here, but a thick
            growth of mezquit trees about twelve feet high, with very Tviie spreading branches.
            These were loaded with beans, on which our half-famished mules fed freely, for it was
            all we could give them. As these trees afforded a FOET YUMA. 149 good shade, we remained
            beneath them dming the day which was as hot as before, th mercurj' high as 106°. But
            even with this heat, we deemed it a great luxury to be surrounded bj such a delightful
            grove, after the total barrenness and desolation with which we had been surrounded for
            so many days. We had now left the plateau of the desert, and were upon the bottom-land
            with an alluvial soil. The party were so much exhausted with the last night's march, and
            the exciting events which preceded it, that I determined to remain quiet during the day,
            and not leave until the moon arose. June dth. Left camp at half-past one in the morn-
            ing, when the moon afforded a feeble light, without which it would have been impossible
            to find our way. The whole party kept close together, with a sharp look out ; as we were
            now in the country of the Yuma In- dians, with whom the Americans are at war. "We learn-
            ed too, from the express that passed us on the desert, that bands of these .Indians had
            been seen here two dcys before. Our journey was through a bottom filled With mezquit and
            cotton- woods ; and from the great quantity of fallen trees of a larsre growth, one is

            from *the river, must have been covered with water within a few years, and for a
            considerable time too, to cause such a de- struction of timber. For several miles after
            leaving the desert, and letween that and the bottom land, there ran along our left a
            great sand-drift, or belt of moving sand, which extends far to the northward, and seems
            to be £?radual- 150 ALAMO MUCHO TO ' fc 1 * Ij encroaching upon the bottom. It is about
            forty feet high, and in its progress swallows up the largest trees of the valley. It is
            so loose as to be impassable for animals, and very difficult for men. At 6 o'clock, our
            eyes were greeted with a sight of the great Colorado River, twelve miles below its
            junction with the Gila, at a place called " The Algo- dones," and soon after, we halted
            upon its bank It was much swollen, and rushed by with great velocity, • washing away the
            banks and carrying with it number- less snags and trees. The water, though sweet, was
            mnh charged with mud, giving it a dark reddish appearance, whence its name. We had seen
            no stream since leaving the Mississippi (the rivers in Upper Cah- fornia excepted) at
            all comparable, in point of size 1 to the Colorado. • After watering the animals, I
            thought it best to proceed a few miles further. Lieutenant Whipple, who had been here
            before, and was familiar with the* coun- try, said we should find a grove of. mezquit
            trees, which would furnish food for the animals ; for the valley of the Colorado affords
            no grass. Near this spot is a rocky spur of the adjacent hills, called " Pilot Knob,
            extending to the river, where we found the remains of a stone fort built a few years
            before, by a party of Americans, who established a ferry here. On this ridge was one of
            the irou monuments erected by the Boundary Commission the year before, which the F Since

            ran along the river's bank, which, as well as the bottom-land, was filled with a dense
            forest of willows, cotton-woods, and mezquit. But we had not proceeded far before our
            progress was suddenly arrested at a place where the road was entirely washed away. We
            now retraced our steps a short distance, but found it impossible to get along with the
            wagons without first cutting a path. . All our axes were therefore brought into J I
            requisition ; but as much time appeared to be neces- sary to accomplish this work, and
            as the pack-mules could push through, Mr. Leroux led" the way followed by Dr. Webb and
            myself. On reaching the spot select- ed by Mr. L. for the encampment, the mules were
            unpacked : we endeavored to lead them to the water, but found to our surprise that it
            could not be approach- ed, in consequence of a high abrupt bank caused by the rushing
            waters of the Colorado. We accordingly sad- dled -up again and pushed on towards Fort
            Yuma, which appeared a few miles in advance, the stars and stripes waving from the
            flag-staff first greeting our eyes through the dense foliage of the valley. When within
            a mile of the Fort, our further progress was stopped by a sluice which extended across
            the road, as broad as the river, and caused by its overflow. It seemed to run far into
            the interior, and to be passable only with boats. Perceiving a rude wigwam on the
            river's bank, the Doctor and myself took possession of it, and, hitch- ing our mules to
            trees, lay down to rest ourselves; for it was then noon, and we had been in the saddle
            since one o'clock in the morning. An hour after I was aroused from my sleep by a 152
            ALAMO MUCHO TO messenger from Major Heintzelman, commanding at Fort Yuma (whose
            sentinels, ever on the watcli, had discovered our approach some hours before), inviting
            me to the Fort, and sending a scow with men to take us across the shiice. Dr. Webb and
            myself availed ourselves of the invitation, the rest of the party with the wagons not
            having yet come up. We proceeded on foot, and, after crossing the sluice, were met by
            several officers, who conducted us to the Major's quar- ters. We received a warm
            reception from them all ; for visitors and countrymen are an exceeding rarity in this
            out of the way spot. A few emigrants, it is true, pass on their way to California ; but
            they seldom reach here before August. Major Heintzelman invited me to take up my
            quarters with him, while Dr. Webb The other officers we met here were Major Andrews,
            Captain Davidson, Lieutenants Curtis, Hendershott, Sweeney, and Bond, and Dr. Milhau.
            The train and the remainder of the Commission encamped on the opposite side of the
            sluice, my wish being to cross the Colorado as soon as possible, which ly from that
            place as from the remained with Lieutenant Paige. could be Fort. ■ June as officers of
            the Commissi ossed the sluice this morning and came up to the Fort, wher kindly received
            and hospita cr they tained. I now commenced arrangements for ( Colorado, which, in
            consequence of the g its waters, and their increased rapidity, was a m of much
            difficulty and risk. There was nothin the rise in et FORT YUMA. 153 cross in but a small
            and indifTerent scow, wliicli could carry but one wagon at a time, and but a small
            number of animals. The entire number to be ferried over were one hundred and thirtj-six
            mules and horses, twelve oxen, and seven wagons with their contents. Anxious that
            Lieutenant Whipple should not be detained a moment with the survey of the river Gila,
            which was to commence at its junction with the Colorado, and be carried to the point
            where the work was suspended in January, I directed his party to be moved over first,
            and as soon as the scow, wdiich needed some repairs, could be made ready. The
            thermometer stood to-day in the shade at the Fort, where there was a current of air, at
            105° ; yet, as we were now quiet, it did not seem more oppressive than when in New York
            at 90°. June 11th. The startling news was brought me this morning, that the Yumas had
            entered our camp the preceding night, and stolen fifteen of our animals, including my
            valuable horse, the same that had been ridden by Mr. Gray in his journey across. He was
            the finest I had seen in the country, and had been brought to New Mexico from Kentucky.
            But this was trifling to the loss of so many riding and pack- mules, as it was
            impossible to replace thctn here. There had been two men on guard during the night ; but
            they knew nothing of our loss until the animals were missing in the morning, when the
            footprints of the Indians became visible. The animals, which had all been staked, or
            tied to trees, seemed to have been loosened and led away without the least noise by
            these accomplished marauders. I gave orders to take the trail and set off in pursuit,
            not with the expectation of 154 ALAMO MUCHO TO ) o overtaking the Indians and recovering
            our property but with the hope that, in the hurry of escape, some of the mules might
            have got away, which we might recover. But the pursuit was not attended with suc- cess.
            The parties returned after foUowin six or eight miles, which was as far as they could go
            with safety ; as the enemy might be lying in ambusli, and overcome their pursuers when
            little expected. Experience has shown the utter futility of pursuing well mounted
            Indians on such an occasion, after they have got three or four hours the start ; for
            they urge on their animals to the utmost speed. Mr. LerouX', who is an old trapper,
            guide, and hunter, and whose life for twenty -five years has been spent in New Mexico,
            has been often engaged in fights with the Indians, as well as in pursuing them to
            recover stolen animals. He says the only way to overtake them in such cases is, to take
            provisions for several days, and on first set- ting out in pursuit, not to hurry the
            animals, but follow the trail at a steady and moderate pace while dayligl'' lasts. At
            night stop and rest ; and as soon as daylight appears, continue the pursuit in the same
            manner, taking care not to overwork the animals. By thus continuing the chase, the third
            day will in most cases bring you up with the enemy ; whose proximity can be ascertained
            by any experienced hunter, from the freshness of the trail, the manure of the animals,
            etc It then becomes necessary to proceed with caution and with scouts ahead. When the
            Indians are dis- covered, the pursuers keep at a distance concealed, and govern
            themselves by circumstances, whether to make an open attack, or wait until they have
            encampe ) ) FORT YUMA. 155 for the night and then surprise them. When Indians find
            themselves pursued, thej run for several days, and then scatter, so that it is
            impossible to catch them; but if they suppose they are not followed, they stop at the
            end of one or two days. Lieutenant Whipple commenced crossing with his party this
            morning. It had been the practice to swim animals across the river ; but it was now so
            swollen I and rapid, as to preclude the possibility of so doing. They had therefore to
            be ferried over in the scow, a few at a time. The wagons were unloaded and taken over
            empty. Even with the aid of all our men, the progress in crossing was slow; and on
            several occa- sions the scow, failing to reach the landing place on the opposite bank,
            was swept away by the current between two and three miles down stream, before a r"
            landing could be effected. It had then to be towed r up again with much labor, until it
            reached some nook or low spot in the bank where the animals could be landed. In this
            manner several hours were sometimes required for a single crossing. lA' 156 FORT YUMA,

            mules. Once, just as the scow reached the opposite bank, one of the cattle broke loose,
            leaped into the iver, and swam back ; the current carrying him so far down, that he

            still engaged mgettmg across the river, I took occasion to make repairs on the wagons.
            My small wagon, in addition to the axle-tree, had given out in other places. An
            examination showed plainly that it was an article "'made to sell," and not to use. Every
            portion was found defective, all flaws being carefully covered up "With paint. With no

            up on the desert was found to be loose in many parts, requirin repairs. In consequence
            of the loss in horses and inules that we had sustained by the Yumas, we were obliged to
            add some hundred pounds to each 158 FORT YUMA of tlie wagons, and an additional weight
            to each pack- mule ; besides which I nearly filled one of the wagons belonging to the
            escort. We should thus have to resume our journey with every wagon and mule loaded to
            the utmost, and without a single spare animal to replace any that might be broken down
            or lost. In repairing injuries to our wagons, every facihty had been furnished me by
            Major Heintzelman, and by Major Andrews, United States Quarter-master at Fort Yuma. For
            their aid also in crossincr the river, and for many acts of kindness extended by the

            at the junction of the Gila and Colorado Rivers, and on the north-west angle of the bank
            of the united stream. The Colorado comes from the north, and, where it re- ceives the
            Gila, is about five hundred yards wide. A bend, which the Gila takes about fifteen miles
            from its mouth, makes it come from the south to join the Colorado. The united stream
            first takes a westerly course, forcing itself through a canon in a chain of rocky hills
            seventy feet high, and about three hundred and fifty yards in length. After sweeping
            around some seven or eight miles, it again assumes a southerly direction ; and after a
            very tortuous course for about a hundred and thirty miles, it empties into the Gulf of m
            w T* " AND THE ADJACENT COUNTRY. 159 California. The rocky hills extend four or five
            hun- dre'd yards north of the junction, and between two and three miles to the south of
            it. Beyond the latter termination rises the great plateau, or desert. The Colorado flows
            through a bottom or valley from two to four miles in width, thickly covered with
            cotton-wood and mezquit ; beyond which is the desert, from sixty to seventy feet above
            the valley. As far as I could judge, from a bird's-eye view taken from Fort Yuma, I
            should think the bottom-land of the Gila was from three to four miles wide near the
            junction. The portion towards the river is thickly covered with cotton-wood, and with
            willows on the margin, while that further back has nothing but mezquit. A fine panoramic
            view is presented of the whole country, from the sum- mit of the hills on which the fort
            stands. Looking northward, the course of the Colorado can be traced for about fifteen
            miles, when it suddenly winds around the base of a mountain ridge, and diverges to the
            north-west. In this direction the view is most exten- sive. Ridge after ridge of
            mountains is seen, one ris- ing above and beyond the other, for a distance of about
            eighty miles. The higher chains assume the most varied and fantastic shapes, resembling
            cupolas, minarets, pyramids, domes, chimneys, etc. One of these singular summits is
            called the " Chimney Rock ; " and from Fort Yuma is the most striking object in the
            landscape. It is said to be fifteen miles distant in a direct line, and about thirty
            following the course of the Colorado. On the east of the Colorado is the delta of the
            Gila. How far this extends back cannot be seen, the trees 160 FORT YUMA Shutting off
            tlie view of the desert. On the north and west the line of the desert is perceived at a
            distance of about three miles, this line of view being inter- rupted by the isolated
            mountain called " Pilot Knob." At the south, short isolated ridges of mountains are t
            distance. Mr. Pratt took a panor o view of the country here, which will convey a better
            idea than any description I can give. .The Gila was not over fifty yards wide at its
            mouth ; but its width varies much in different seasons, beni influenced by the rise of
            the Colorado, as well as the state of its own waters. The Colorado was now so high as to
            cause the Gila to flow back full fifteen miles. The Gila was still low, and, except near
            the junctic but a diminutive stream. It is doubtful whether it can ever be navigated,
            except at its floods, and these are by no means regular. At such times flat-bottomed
            boats might pass to the mouth of the Salinas, near the Pimo villages. liar bend which
            the Colorado takes after 3 Gila, gives to the United States both its J o banks for the
            distance of seven miles from the junction, or to the point where it resumes its
            southerly course. This arises from the stipulations of the fifth article of the treaty
            with Mexico defining the boundary line, which says, that "a straight line shall be drawn
            from the mid- dle of the Rio Gila, where it unites with the Colorado, to a point on the
            coast of the Pacific Ocean, distant one marine league due south of the southernmost
            point of the port of San Diego." The land on the southern bank of the Colorado which we
            thereby obtain is of little value for agricultural purposes; but should a considerable i

            altogether probable if a railway should ever pass here, it will be an advantage to the
            United States to possess both the banlvs of this river for so long a distance. The
            bottom-lands of the Colorado below the junc- tion bear the traces of former cultivation,

            the barracks. There were two hundred soldiers, artillery and infantry, here, under the
            command of Major Heintzelman. The officers and men were living in tents, covered with
            sheds made of branches to protect them from the sun. The post was established the year
            previous, but, not receiving the usual supply of provisions, had been .abandoned for
            several months. The command was as -comfortably situated as the nature of the place and
            its inaccessibility would allow ; but long deprivation of fresh provisions and
            vegetables had engendered the .scurvy among the soldiers. The fort had heretofore been
            supplied by laud from San Diego, at an enormous expense ; but a par- tially successful
            attempt had just been made to supply the place by water. A vessel loaded with stores w
            up the Gulf of California, and succeeded some but owing to the O" T current she could
            not reach the fort. Wagons ana scows were therefore sent down to bring up the prO'
            visions, a labor attended with nearly as much risk .and expense as bringing them all the
            way by land from the coast. It was in contemplation to procure a small steamer for
            fetching the supplies from the head of the gulf Such a vessel could meet with little or
            no difficulty in getting up, and could also be used to .advantage in exploring the

            COUNTRY. 163 h5 nia, a distance now understood to be about one hun- dred and thirty
            miles, by the sinuosities of the river. . With this view, I recommended to the Hon.
            Alex. ' H. H. Stuart, Secretary of the Interior, that Lieuten- ant I. G. Strain, of the
            Navy, an officer attached to the Commission, should be directed to take the four iron
            boats belonging to it, and survey the head waters of the Gulf of California, and the
            river Colorado to the mouth of the Gila. Lieutenant Strain accordingly proceeded to
            Washington, and submitted to the Hon. Secretary of the Interior the plan embraced in the
            following letter: *' Washixgtox, D. C, October 31, 1850. " Sir : — In reference to the
            duly to wliich J. R. Bartlett, Esq., the United States Boundary Commissioner, requested
            I should be assigned, I have the honor herewith to submit two projects — one of which, I
            hope, may merit your approval. " In assigning me to the command of the flotilla,
            composed of four boats belonging to the Boundary Commission, it was suggested that- m
            consideration of the important results which must accrue to the country from the early
            exploration and survey of the river Colorado below its junction with the Gila, as well
            as that of the upper waters of the Gulf of California, without which the former would be
            nearly valueless, — the Navy Department might be induced to detail the requisite number
            of seamen for the management of the boats; which would thus materially lessen the outlay
            of the fund appropriated for the prosecution of the Boundary Survey. No men could be
            obtained better adapted to this duty than seamen. " The importance ©f the examination
            proposed by Mr. Bartlett, is obvious to every one acquainted with the present state of
            our new ter- ritories on the Pacific, while the peculiar nature of the case does not
            place the duties in any particular department of the government. The examination of the
            upper part of the Gulf, and that portion of the Colo- rado between its mouth and
            junction with the Gila, cannot be consider- ed as pertaining to the * Coast Survey,'' as
            it is entirely embraced in the 164 FORT YCMA territory of the Mexican Republic ; yet
            tlie treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, giving to our citizens free ingress to the valleys of
            the Gila and Colorado, through the Gulf, which is the only route available for tlie
            purposes' of commerce, makes an early examination of equal importance to that of any
            portion of the coast of our newly acquired territories. 'Coiild the sympathies of the
            Navy Department be enlisted in - favor of this examination, and crews assigned to tlie
            boats already biult for the use of the Boundary Commission, the service could be
            effectu- ally and economically performed. " If, however, the government should not deem
            such measures desir- able, I would respectfully suggest another project, which, though
            it -would not possess all the advantages of that already suggested, would prove the most
            economical mode of prosecuting the explorations and surveys with the funds which are
            now, or may be placed hereafter, at the disposal of the Interior Department and the
            Boundary Comnus- sioner. "The second project is as follows : That the four boats should
            be dispatched, in charge of two passed midshipmen and five seamen, in a steamer Avhich
            will sail about the first of December to Mazatlan ; and that I should be authorized to
            proceed to EI Paso, wdiere the Commis- sion will be compelled to winter, and obtain from
            the party at that point a sufficient number of men to man the boats, and proceed with
            tnem overland to the port of Guaymas, on the Gulf of California, to which points the
            boats will be conveyed from ]\razatlan in a coasting vessel* " From Guaymas we could
            easily ascend the Gulf in our boats to the point where it would be desirable to commence
            our examinations. " The advantage of this plan will be its economy ; as it will require
            but a few persons, who may be obtained from the navy, in addition to those who are
            already drawing pay and subsistence from the government. At present, the number of men
            forming the main body of the Commissiou is greater than can be advantageously employed ;
            while the scarcity o provisions at El Paso, owing to the drought of last season, will
            make their subsistence enormously expensive during the winter. The horses and mules now
            belonging to the Commission, will have to be sold at r- Paso, or sustained at a heavy
            expense during the winter : and by . ploying a portion of them to transport the party to
            Guaymas, no addi- tional expense Avill be entailed upon the Survey, as they and the men
            can be more economically subsisted on the journey than at EI Paso. / t AND THE ADJACEXT

            expense of subsisting a large party of men and animals at El Paso durino the ensuinor
            winter, will be corrobo- rated by Colonel J. Rogers, special Indian agent, who is
            familiar with the present state of the country ; while the opinions which I have ex-
            pressed, relative to the importance of the explorations proposed by Mr. Bartlett, you
            can assure yourself of by reference to the accompanying condensed narrative, which, you
            will observe, confirms the opinion pub- lished by the Hon. T. Butler King as to the
            fertility of the valley of the Colorado, and its future importance to our country. "To
            display the feasibility of a journey from M Paso to Guaymas I have also inclosed a
            narrative of a journey through that region. " Very respectfully your obedient servant, "

            Stuart, Secretary of the Interior." The distinguished gentlemen then at the head of the
            Interior Department, ever anxious to promote the cause of science, and particularly
            where the acquisition of' knowledge of our newly acquired possessions was concerned,
            thought favorably of my suggestion, and the plan of Lieut. Strain, and, as I was
            informed, would have permitted that officer to carry it into effect. Be- fore, however,
            he had an opportunity to do so, Brvt. Lt. Col. Graham had been detailed as Principal
            Astrono- Bier, etc., to the Commission, and Mr. Stuart deemed it proper to refer
            Lieutenant Strain's letter and papers to him. The plan, strange as it may appear, was
            objected to by Colonel Graham. In reply, he remark 166 FORT YUMA ed that it was "aii
            injudicious arrangement, and ought to be dispensed with ;" that, although " by the late
            treaty, our citizens have the right of ingress and egress through the Gulf of
            California," we might " give of- fence" to Mexico by the proceeding ; and that the ex-
            penses attending this Survey could not be legitimately met from the appropriations
            granted by Congress for the Survey." But the last and most extraordinary assertion is,
            that such an examination as Lieutenant Strain proposes, in connection with the Survey,
            should not be intrusted to a naval ofletcer. • "I have been frequently engaged on surveys
            for the last thirty years," says Colonel Graham, " of rivers, harbors, and portions of
            the sea'-coast, and always found the best persons to manage the boats employed on such
            service, were the engineers and surveyors charged with, ana responsible for, the
            execution of the duty." Colonel Graham's letter to Secretary Stuart, embracing his
            objections, will be found in Appendix E. As the defeat of my plan has been a serious
            injury both to government and to commerce, I shall show that, both by the treaty with
            Mexico and my instructions, I had authority to make the examination referred to. The
            sixth article of the treaty of Guadalupe Hidal- go provides, that " The vessels and
            citizens of the United States shall, in all time, have a free and uninterrupted passage
            by the Gulf of California, and by the river Colorado below its confluence with the Gila,
            to and from their posses- sions situated north of the boundary line defined in the

            the immense frontier along the line to be explored and surveyed, fully authorized me to
            seek such facts. In his instruc- tions to me, the Hon. Secretary of the Interior says :
            " As the organization of the Commission under your charge has been made for the purpose
            of collecting information relative to the country contiguous to the boundary line, in
            addition to the running of that line, it is desirable that you should avail yourself of
            every opportunity afforded by your passage through the unexplored regions of Texas, New
            Mexico, and Cali- fornia, to acquire information, as to its geography, - natural
            history, etc., when it can be obtained without retarding the progress of the Survey."* My
            duties required me to send boats to the mouth of the Gila to survey that portion of the
            river, as well as to carry provisions there for the surveying parties ; and I should
            have been guilty of neglect had I not endeavored to take advantage of this opportunity
            to examine the Tapper part of the gulf, and that portion of the Colo- rado between its
            mouth and the junction with the Gila. A minute survey of the entire gulf, about which
            Colonel Graham has made calculations, was not contemplated by either Lieutenant Strain

            divides the stream Califor running northward, and the other on the opposite side,
            running north-west. The people went ashore, and found themselves between two rapid
            currents : one of the rivers ebb, and in the other the sea was flowing m with no less
            impetuosity, so that they had a very narrow escape."! He attempted to go up the Colorado
            ; but the current was so rapid that the boats could not stem it, and having no ropes to
            tow them, the project ot further exploration was abandoned. The only attempt in recent
            times to enter the Colo- rado before the occupation of California by the United States,
            of which I have knowledge, is that of Lieute- nant Hardy of the British navy. J This
            gentleman vas sent out by an English company connected with the pearl fishery 'in the
            gulf; and in the course of his explorations he visited the Colorado. He has given us a
            plan of the mouth of the river, accompanied by soundings; which bears every mark of
            correctness, with the exception of an error in laying down the river Gila. For this he
            mistook a small branch falling t Hatluyt's Voyages, vol lii., p. 425. Loud London, 1829,

            have been a sluice filled Avitb the rushing water from the tides of the gulf This latter
            I think the more probable supposition. The Gila, as I have already mentioned, is known
            to enter the Colorado at more than a hun- ■ died miles from its mouth. Lieutenant Hardy
            found two small islands at the mouth of the river, and entered by the western chan- nel
            ; where there was, at the narrowest point, but a sin- e- fathom of water, the width
            varying from ninety to two hundred yards. Owing to the narrowness of the channel, he was
            obliged to stand in so close to the shore that the jib-boom nearly touched it. The
            western bank was here high and perpendicular. The tide was running at the rate of nine
            miles an hour. With all his care, the vessel was thrown on shore, where she lay eight
            days. The flood and ebb tides swept by with the same velocity ; and on one occasion the
            receding tide left his vessel one hundred and fifty feet from the water. He waited in
            vain for slack water, in order to replace the rudder, which had been unshipped. '' But
            in the Colorado," he says, " there is no such thing as slack water. Before the ebb has
            finished running the flood commences boiling up full eighteen inches above the surface,
            and roaring like the rapids of Canada." Since the foregoing was written, I have read an
            account of the most recent attempt to ascend the Colo- rado, which is given in the
            accompanying note * Tliis statement is contained in the San Francisco Herald of June
            11th, 1833: 172 FORT YUMA A few weeks before my arrival here, a fight took soldiers and
            a body of Yuma bet' eight I in which the former were all killed The Mi\ Turnbull left
            San Francisco in the schooner General Patterson, with stores for the garrison at Fort
            Yuraa. At the mouth of the Colo- rado he met with a serious obstacle in the number of
            sand-banks and the high tides, "The tide," he says, "rises from twelve to sixteen feet
            every twelve hours j the tidal wave, being sometimes four feet high, carries every thing
            before it. If a vessel stnkes on a sand-bank at high tide, she becomes high and dry in a
            little while, and may remain so for WTcks before she can be got off. Fortunately, the
            General Pattei-son, shortly after entering the mouth of the river, met j\ whale-boat
            contain- ing the mates and Jour of the crew of a vessel belonging to Mr. Turn- bull,
            which had been Ivinof in the river for several months. They had been engaged in
            obtaining soundings, and Yere consequently enabled to pilot the Patterson up, Yilhout
            stopping at every moment to try whether she was over one of the dreaded sand-banks. In
            this way she ascended the river thirty 4hree miles in two days, and anchored. No other
            vessel had ever before made the same distance in less than twenty days. Mr. Turnbull,
            with a party, took a whale-boat at this point, and ascended the river to Fort Yunla,
            upwards of a hundred miles. "Tlie river was swollen almost to a torrent by the melting
            of the snow at the head waters ; and the country for fifteen miles on both sides was
            entirely inundated, the water standing four feet deep upon its banks. The current was
            running at the rate of seven or eight.miles an hour, and multitudes of floating snao-s
            of trees were rushing down. So cojupletely was the country overflowed, that Mr. TurnbuU
            found m a distance of a hundred and twenty-five miles but two dry spots on tbe banks
            where he could cook his food. He was obliged to sleep on board his boat, as there was no
            land to be seen. • " Within a few miles of Fort Yuma, he heard of the loss of the
            steamer Uncle Sam, which it was his purpose to run regularly on the Colorado. He had
            brought out machinery for her in the Patterson, which would have enabled him to stem the
            current of the river, and probably to have ascended considerably above the Fort. Ue has
            not yet given up his purpose, and will take, the hull of another steamer out, the
            machinery being still at the Fort." f AND THE ADJACENT COUNTRY. 173 Indians approached
            the soldiers, and drew their fire, when a large number, who lay in ambush, rushed upon
            them with the short clubs which form their principal weapon, and put them all to death.
            Major Ileintzelman in turn sent several parties against them, and drove them all from
            the banks of the Colorado for some eighty miles abofe, destroying their corn fields and
            their villages. They had been so cruel and treache- rous to the various parties of
            Americans passing here, and had manifested so much hostility towards the troops, that it
            was found useless to attempt to conciliate them, or make any treaty with them, unless
            they themselves were forced to come in and ask it. They have often made treaties with
            the Mexicans, only to break them when a favorable opportunity offered to plunder and
            •murder. When Lieutenant Whipple was here, in 1849, with a party of engineers, to
            determine the point of junction between the two rivers, and establish the monuments on
            the boundary line, he remained several months among them, on terms of intimacy and
            friendship.' One afternoon while here. Major Heiutzelman and myself made some
            experiments to ascertain the velocity of the Colorado below the junction. The result
            gave us 5 miles per hour. But it must be remembered Since tlie above was written, Major

            so hard that they at length came in and begged for peace, which was at once granted

            they cultivate, raising wheat, corn, melons, leans, etc. ; and the best feeling exists
            between them and the Ameri- cans. s V 174 FORT YUMA that tlie river was then mucli
            swollen. When low, it flows at the rate of about two miles an hour. It is then but four
            feet deep at the fording place at the Algodones, where we first saw it ; and at such
            tilnes wagons, mules, and cattle may easily cross. When the engineering parties crossed
            here in January, thej swam their mules and were taken t)ver in boats by the Indians. By
            a stake planted below the junction-, Major Heintzelman ascertained the rise of the river
            to have been thirteen feet and six inches, when at its highest point, which it attained
            on the 13th of June, while the Commission was here. Four miles below Fort Yuma are the
            remains of a fortification called Fort Defiance. This is the spot where we first
            encamped, and were unable to reach the water. It was an old ferrying place, tand the
            scene of a mas- ' sacre by the Yumas the year before our visit, the par- ticulars of
            which I will state. In 1849, when large numbers of people from the United States and the
            adjacent province of Sonora wer emigrating to California, many came by the Gila and
            crossed the Colorado here. At this time, as there was no garrison on the spot, nor any
            white settlers, the Yumas derived quite an advantage from aiding emi- grants to cross,
            having by some means obtained a boat or scow for the purpose. A party of Americans, see-
            ing a prospect of a lucrative business by the estabhsh- ment of a ferry, dispossessed
            tlie Indians of their boat, drove them from the river, and would not permit them to help
            emigrants across or otherwise have any tniOo to do with them. The leader in this affair
            was a Vr- Langdon, of Louisiana. The ferry was established a e AND THE ADJACENT COUNTRY,
            175 the rocky spur before alluded to ; upon which, directly on the bank of the river,
            they built a rude fort wherein they could defend themselves. This, in contempt for the
            natives whom they had dispossessed of their rights, they called Fort Defiance. The party
            which originally established the ferry was fitted out by J. P. Brodie, Esq., a gentleman
            living atHermosillo, in Sonora, of whom I have before spoken : he advanced the money for
            the purpose, and retained an interest in it. While this aentleman had the direc- tion of
            affairs, no further offence was given to the In- dians, and emigrants were always
            treated well and fairly dealt with. Not long after, however, a man named Gallantin was
            employed by Dr. Langdon, or in some other way became interested in the ferry. He turned
            out to be a bad fellow, and was supposed to be a fugi- tive from justice. He treated the
            Indians most brutally, and practised all sorts of impositions upon the passing
            emigrants, charging about four dollars a head for every one who crossed the river. He
            also extorted large sums from the Sonorians when returning to their homes from the
            mines, when he found or believed they had any considerable amount of gold with them.
            When Dr. Langdon found out the character of Gal- lantin, he endeavored to get rid of
            him, but found him- self unable to do so. About this time Gallantin took occasion to
            visit San Diego ; and there his party got into a fight, in which a soldier was killed.

            some fifteen uersons. ' ,Th men were at some distance in the wood cutting- tifiiber ;
            these, seeing from the actions of the Indians that something was wrong, suc- ceeded in
            concealing themselves, and made their escape by joining a party of Mexicans who soon
            after came along. A large sum of money, all that had been saved by Langdon and Gallantin

            tended to encourage the d Yumasin acts of violence, in. which many innocent an
            unoffending parties perished. I heard of one occa- sion on which a party of emigrants
            crossed while the Ynmas retained the ferry. The Indians showed friend- ship for them,
            and assisted in making their fires and in taking charge of their animals. The party
            cooked their meal, and sat down quietly to eat ; for although numbers of the Yumas were
            about their fires and the camp, their presence caused no uneasiness, as they were
            unprovided with arms. But on a sudden, at a given signal, they each seized a billet of
            wood from the fire, and knocked out the brains of the Ameri- cans. The ferry is at

            Fort Yuma, the largest and most important tribe are the Yumas. These people occupy both
            sides of the Colo- rado both above and below the junction with the Gila. But how far
            they extend to the north is not known ; probably not less than a hundred miles. Of the
            tribes to the north of them, very little is known. There has * In cousequence of the

            Fort Yuma, I spoke of the heaps of dried carcasses and skeletons which we saw at Carrizo
            Creek ; but it seems that the desert is not the only difficulty vhich the owners have to
            contend with. During the previous winter, the \ umas took advantage of the temporary
            abandonment of the Fort by the troops, to molest the parties of passing emigrants,
            particularly when they could rob them of their mules, cattle, and sheep. The most
            flagrant case, was the loss of 4,217 sheep, belonging to Mr. Joseph White. He had
            succeeded in getting them over the Colorado in safety, and was preparing to cross the
            desert. But at this time the Indians hegan to press them hard, killing and stealing
            tifie sheep. To add to the misfortunes of the drovers, their water gave out, and the
            sheep could not be forced to travel daring the day in consequence of the intense heat.
            The men, to save their Kves, hastened on to the water, leaving the sheep until they
            could return. The Indians, who followed them close, took advan- tage of their situation,

            early missionaries who traversed that region have placed on their maps seve- ral tribes,
            whose very names have now disappeared. On the old maps there are found west of the
            Colorado the Genigue7i,th.e Gliemegudbas the Jumhidcrariri and the Timhahaclii tribes of
            whose existence in our day The missionaries who mention them, are correct in all their
            statements, as far as we are now able to judge, and it is therefore probable that there
            were small tribes bearing the above names. Father Kino, who was here in the year 1700,
            mentions the Quiquimas, Coanpas, Bajiopas, and Cutganes, while the distinguished
            philologist Hervas, in his " Catalogo de las Lenguas," names many others, the authority
            for . which, is the early missionaries. At Fort Yuma, we heard of a tribe called the
            Mohavi, who occupy the country watered by a river of the same name, which empties into
            the Colorado about one hundred and fifty miles above the fort. They are said to be a
            fine * athletic people, exceedingly warlike, and superior to the other tribes on the
            river. On the eastern side, the same missionaries notice the Tehuas, Cosninas, and Mo-
            qm's. A tribe of the first-named family lived in New Mexico. The Cosninas I presume to
            be the same as the CocJi-nich-nos, whom Mr. Leroux met in his late jour- ney down the
            Colorado, althouo-h, on account of their hostility, he had no intercourse with them. The

            some intercourse. This people cultivate the soil, raise numbers of sheep, hve in large

            eastern bank of the river, who make blankets. The Mexicans also speak of a tribe called
            the Tontos, or fools, on the east- ern bank of the river ; who are said to be allietl to
            the * Apaches. It is probable that, with the exception of the great tribes, they are
            known among each other by different names, which have some connection with the mountains
            or rivers near which they dwell, or with some peculiarity which distinguishes them from
            each other. Thus the Yumas are also called Cuchans ; and, as I have before stated, the
            Diegenos, who derive their name from San Diego, are the Gomeya of early times. It is
            also certain that many tribes which the mission- aries found in California and the
            northern parts of Mexico, are now extinct.* On the Gila, no tribes have any fixed
            habitation; nor are any lands irrigated and cultivated, until the district occupied by
            the Coco-Mari- copas and Pimos is reached, two hundred miles to the east. The Yumas
            occasionally range up and down the Gila, but only on predatory excursions. They strictly
            belong to the Colorado near the junction with the Gila, where they were found by the
            earliest explorers. Between the Gila and the Gulf, and near the latter, there is also
            found a tribe called the Cocojpas. They occasionally visit Fort Yuma, and profess to be
            at peace with the Americans. They are less numerous than the Yumas, with whom they are
            at war. Eecently a party of the Yumas were surprised by them, their chief and Of the

            the Cocopas* who would not be the first tribe which the warlike Yumas have extinguished.
            When Lieutenant Whipple was at the junction of the Colorado and Gila rivers, in 1849,
            engaged in astronomical observations for the Boundary Commis- sion, he was constantly
            surrounded by the Yuma In- dians, and had therefore a good opportunity to observe their
            habits. He has permitted me to copy from his journal the following notices of them. When
            he reached the Colorado, he was met by Santiago, one of the chiefs, who conducted his
            party to their village, where they were surrounded by great numbers of the Indians. "
            The women are generally fat, and their dress consists of a fringe made of strips of
            bark, bound round the hips and hanging loosely to the middle of the thighs. The men are
            large, muscular, and well formed. Their countenances are pleasing, and seem lighted by
            intelligence. Their warriors wear the white breech ; and their hair hanging in plaits to
            the middle of their backs, is adorned with eagle's feathers, and the rattle of a
            rattlesnake. They are exquisite horsemen, and carry their bow and lance with inimitable
            grace." While the party remained at the lower crossing wait- ing for a road to be cut,
            the Indians were very sociable, carrying them grass, beans, melons, and squashes ; for
            which, they received in return tobacco or money. They professed great friendship for the
            Americans, and declared that they "had never stolen from the j.u . AND THE ADJACENT

            near the mouth of the' Gila, they represented as being a desperate set of rascals."
            Lieut. Whipple afterwards met the head chief, Pablo, who wore a scarlet coat trimmed
            with gold lace, with epau- lettes of silver wire, and, to crown all, green goggles. b
            His legs and feet were bare, but he did not allow that to detract from the dignity of
            his manner. At this time the Yumas had extensive fields of maize, and patches of melons
            and squashes. When the party under Dr. Webb crossed the Colo- rado, in January, the good
            feelings of these Indians towards the Americans had changed. They had already murdered
            the party of Dr. Langdon and Gal- lanton, and had had difficulties with several parties
            of emigrants. Dr. Webb and his companions, therefore, beld but little intercourse with
            them. The Indians ferried them across the river, taking the opportunity to drown a mule
            or two, which they afterwards secured and ate. At the same time Mr. Pratt took some
            sketches and portraits of them, and Dr. Webb obtained a com- plete vocabulary of their
            language. I have before stated that Fernando Alarchon dis- covered and entered the
            Colorado in the year 1542. The narrative of his remarkable voyage at this early period
            shows that the zeal for adventure and discovery was quite as great at that period as
            now. He states that he went up the river eighty-five leagues, which is quite probable ;
            when his further progress was arrested lofty mountains, throuh which the river ran,
            where it was impossible to draw their boats. This was unquestionably the great canon,
            where the moun- 182 ' FORT TUMA ' tains cross tlie river, and through wMcli it has
            worked for itself a deep channel. This canon is known to all the trappers, and is said
            to extend from two to three hundred miles, throughout which distance it is only passable
            in two or three places. As he progressed, Alarchon made diligent inquiries about the
            country and people. In reply he was told that the river ran much further up into the
            land than he had yet come ; but his informers did not knov its head, as it was still
            very far in the interior. He learned also that many other streams fell into it. As far
            as he went, he found the natives cultivating maize. They brought him cakes of maize and
            loaves of mezquique* Neither wheat nor beans were known to them. To ascertain this fact,
            our traveller took with him these articles, which he showed the Indians, and at which

            barking of the dogs during the night, he believed the Indians had been near the fort.
            Soon after one of the herdsmen came in, and reported that he had discovered many Indian
            foot-prints around the base of the hill. The ferrymen, who slept near, were aroused at
            the same time, and saw from the hill two fires in opposite directions, two or three
            miles distant, near the banks of the Colorado. They were doubtless intended for signals.
            A party of soldiers was sent out to reconnoitre in the bottom around the «rt ; and
            subsequently a detachment of fifteen, under command of Lieutenant Hendershott, was
            dispatched on a scout. Our wagons now being completed and every thing in readiness, we
            bade farewell to our excellent friends, I 186 FORT YUMA i and at four o'clock, p. m.,
            crossed the river to our camp on the opposite shore, accompanied by Major Heintz- elman.
            The mercury at noon to-day stood at 100 Fahrenheit. June \Wi. We took our departure at
            five o'clock in the morning. As Lieutenant Whipple was actively employed in completing
            the survey of the Gila, my own party was reduced to Dr. Webb, Messrs. G. Thur- ber, H.
            C. Pratt, and M. Seaton, which last was return- ing to rejoin his party on the Rio
            Grande. We had also, of course, the necessary attendants in servants, cooks, arrieros,
            and herders ; and were accompanied by Lieutenant Paige, with fifteen soldiers.
            Lieutenant Whipple retained the remaining men of Colonel Craig s command, and twelve of
            those furnished by Major Heintzelman. Our provisions, baggage, and camp equipage were
            carried partly in wagons and partly on pack-mules. We took the travelled road, which we
            followed for two or three hours along the bottom-land on the south bank of the Gila, and
            then turned ofi* and fol- lowed the trail of Lieutenant Whipple, which led to the river.
            After pursuing this route a couple of miles, we got entangled in so dense an
            undergrowth, inter- spersed with little hillocks and dead trees, that our progress was
            completely stopped. Fearing that our wagons would be broken if we proceeded, we turned
            back and attempted to regain the road ; but in this direction the same impediments
            presented themselves. Being thus brought to a stand, I sent men out to find the river,

            and after doubling the teams to cross a bed of loose sand, we succeeded in reaching it,
            and there we encamped. No grass was found ; but the mules ate ■ with avidity the cane
            which grew on the river's banks. Distance travelled, fifteen miles. . June IWi, Left
            camp at six o'clock; and after pro- ceeding through loose sand and arroyos, and cutting
            our way through the jungle which grew near the stream, we reached the road, and soon
            after a spur of the mountain ridge around which the river ran. In going down a short and
            steep hill, the king-bolt of one of the wagons broke, in consequence of which we were
            compelled to unload it, which detained us about an hour. Continuing our journey, we
            struck the Gila at one o'olock ; where, to our agreeable surprise, we found a small
            patch of coarse grass, the first we had seen, excepting a tuft here and there on the
            desert, since leaving San Felipe. For the fifteen days since we left that place our
            animals had lived almost exclu- sively upon the mezquit bean, and twigs of willow,
            cotton- wood, and mezquit bushes. We encamped here, having come twelve miles. The bottom
            here does not exceed a quarter of a mile in width, owing to the proximity of the moun-
            tains on each side of the river. The vegetation con- sists of willow and mezquit. We
            found that Lieutenant Whipple had had a station near us, and had moved forward but an
            hour before our arrival. June 20tk Resumed our journey at half-past five morning, over a
            sandy road, and soon after left th the bottom and ascended to the table-land, here 188
            FORT YUMA vated about forty feet above it. The vegetation con- sisted of mezquit and
            palo verde. After journeying about six miles, we overtook Lieu- tenant Whipple with the
            surveying party, and agreed to encamp together six miles further ahead. We pro- ceeded
            to the point fixed on, which we reached at 11 o'clock and pitched our tents, having made
            but twelve miles. The bottom-land continued narrow, the desert approaching quite near on
            both sides of the river. There was no grass ; but with cane and mezquit, our mules did
            very well. On the northern side of the river, arose a mountain chain about twelve miles
            distant, presenting a con- tinuation of fantastic summits, among which were three
            resembling the tops of Hindu pagodas. I took a sketch of these singular mountains ;
            although at such a dis- tance, but little more than the outlines could be dis- cerned.
            day, for the first time since leaving F T we again encountered our friend the jpetahay
            a, or Giauu Cereus, which we had met with the preceding Septem- ber in Sonora ; and much
            to our delight, we found it m bloom. The fruit, too, appeared in various stages of
            perfection. As no full and correct description has yet been given to the world of this
            extraordinary produc- tion of the vegetable kingdom, and as I had the advan- tage of
            seeing it at different periods of the year, in flower as well as in fruit, I shall
            endeavor to give a popular account of it. The buds, flowers, fruit, seed, etc., were
            collected by Mr. George Thurber, Botanist to the Com- mission ; and by him a scientific
            description of it wul be prepared, with the aid of a distinguished botanist Jk iJi'll'

            is found on the high table-lands on either side of the Gila, and in various parts of the
            State of Sonora, growing often in the crevices of rocks, and in other situations where
            it would seem difficult for any vegetable production to find sustenance. The are various
            : sometimes rising? like a form assumes pie fluted column, although more frequently IS
            furnished with several branches, which, after leaving the main trunk, turn gracefully
            upwards and rise paral- 190 rORT YUMA lei with it. Sometimes the branches are singularly
            contorted ; but usually, their disposition is symmetri- cal, and the appearance of the
            whole plant has been, not inaptly, compared to that of a giant candelabrum. The stem is
            from one foot to two feet six inches in diameter, usually smaller near the base, and
            from twen- ty to fifty feet in height. This immense column is admirably strengthened by
            a circle of ribs of strong and elastic wood, which are imbedded in the cellular mass of
            the plant, several inches within the circumference, and extend to the roots. This oody
            portion remains after the fleshy substance of the plant decays, looking like a huge
            skeleton. The stem is marked with longi- tudinal furrows, which are shallow towards the
            ground, and deeper and more numerous towards the summit; and above the ribs it is
            thickly set with clusters of spines or thorns. Of these there are six large and numerous
            small ones, in each cluster. As the plant increases in age, the larger spines fall off,
            leaving a ray of smaller ones, which lie close to the stem. Most travellers who have
            noticed this cereus, have not been fortunate enough to see the fruit and flower, but
            have derived their accounts of them from the In- dians. On our passage across the
            country in Septem- ber, October, November, and December, we saw the tree ; and on our
            return in June and July, we had the satisfaction of beholding the fruit in perfection,
            and occasional specimens of the flower. The plant proba- bly blooms late in May, or
            early in June ; and the u' is matured in July and August. The flowers are borne on the
            summits of the branches, are three inches i diameter, and about the same in length. The
            peta s TO THE COCO-MARICOPA VILLAGES. 191 are stiff and curling, and of a cream-white
            color. The stamens are yellow and very numerous. The fruit is about the size and shape
            of an egg ; sometimes rather longer than the true egg shape, having a few small scales,
            without spines. The color of the fruit is green tinged with red, when fully ripe. It
            consists of I. an outer coat or skin filled with a red pulp, inclosing numerous small,
            black, smooth seeds. The fruit, when mature, bursts at the top and exposes the pulp,
            which at this time is rather mawkish to the taste ; but a few days' exposure to the sun
            dries it to about one third its original bulk, and the whole mass drops out of the skin.
            In this state it has the consistency of the pulp of a dried fig ; and the saccharine
            matter being concen- trated by drying, it somewhat resembles that fruit in taste. The
            Pimo and other Indians, collect the pulp and roll it into balls ; in which state it
            probably keeps the whole year, as it was offered to our party which passed through in
            January. They also boil the pulp m water, and evaporate it to the consistence of molas-
            ses; after which, it is preserved in earthen jars.* It has been supposed that the
            petahaya was firet made known by Major Emory in his Notes of a Military Reconnoisance,
            etc. in 1847: but I shall show that the plant is by no means new, and that it has been
            »»oticed by many of the earlier travellers in the region where it is found. In
            describing the plants of California, Venegas says, " The principal »s the JctaAaya, the
            fruit of which forms the great harvest of the poor •nbabitants here. This tree is not
            known in Europe, and differs from all other trees in the world : its branches are fluted
            and rise vertically from the stem, so as to form a very beautiful top ; they are without
            eaves, the fruit growing to the boughs ; the pulp resembles that of a g, only more soft
            and luscious. In some it is white, in some red, and in others yellow, but always of an
            exquisite taste; some again are wholly 192 rORT YUMA A number of the fish called by
            Major Emory the '*Gila trout" were caught near our camp by Mr. Pratt with a hook and
            line. They proved very pala- table, where fresh fish is such a rarity ; but the flesh is
            quite soft, owing to the warmth of the water, and would scarcely be tolerated on the
            tables of the Atlan- tic coast '' At a little distance," says Major E., 'you will
            imagine the fish covered with delicate scales; but, on a closer examination, you will
            find that they sweet, others of a grateful acid. And as the petahaya is very juicj, it
            is chiefly found in dry soil." — JVatural and Civil History of Califor- nia. London,

            says, " resemble the carnival in some parts of Europe, when the men are in a great
            measure stupefied or mad. The natives here, also, throw aside what little reason they

            part of the Major; for a mistake it certainly is. Scales were as plainly seen on all we
            caught as upon any fish ; and I found no difl5- cnlty in taking them off with my
            finger-nails from the smallest specimens- AYe caught . them at different times from
            eight to eighteen inches in length.- After coming into camp to-day, I determined to push
            on with my party to the villages of the Pimo of what he calls the Petahaya Tepexiccnsis,
            which is undoubtedly the plant in question. — See Historia Plantarum Novce Hispanice, —

            of the stem, which resemble the pipes of an oi"gan: and second, from the resemblance

            tree, which I had never seen before, here arrested my attention. It grows to the height
            of forty or fifty feet. The top is cone-shaped, and almost without foliage. The bark

            was, and would continue to be, slow ; besides which their duties com- pelled them to

            weather was excessively hot, the mercury ranging every day above 100 in the most shady
            places we could find ; and we were without vegetables of any sort, — a depri- vation
            which already began to show its effects upon the men. For these reasons, I deemed it
            best for the health of the party and the preservation of the ani- mals to proceed in
            advance to the Pimo villages, where an abundance of grass and vegetables could be pro-
            cured. I accordingly made a division of our pi visions with Lieutenant Whipple and his
            party, and left with him such an escort as he considered necessary for his protection.
            June 2\st. The road to-day was sandy, and conse- quently heavy, until we reached the
            table-land. The 0- getation continued as before ; mezquit, palo verde and larrea
            prevailing, and the great cereus occurring with still greater frequency. At one o'clock
            we struck the river where it passes within two hundred feet of a bold dark-colored
            bluff, the termination of a shor mountain range, which here is about six hundred le
            high, and near which we encamped. Estimated di:5 tance travelled, seventeen miles. As
            the weather con- i \ TO THE COCO-MAEICOPA VILLAGES. ' 195 tiniied hot, we endeavored, by
            making very early starts, to terminate our day's journeys by noon. A number of fist,
            were brought in to-day by the . Mexicans resembling the buffalo-fish of the Mississippi.
            They drove them into a small nook in a laguna near by, and then rushed into the water
            and killed them with poles. I ate of them at dinner, but found them soft and
            unpalatable. Towards evening, when the sun began to lose its force, I took my
            sketch-book and went to the base of the bluff, where I had noticed as we passed a number
            of inscribed rocks. I found hundreds of these bould- ers covered with rude figures of
            men, animals, and other objects of grotesque forms, all pecked in with a sharp
            instrument. Many of them, however, were so much defaced by long exposure to the weather,
            and by subsequent markings, that it was impossible to make them out. Among these rocks I
            found several which contained sculptures on the lower side, in such a posi- tion that it
            would be impossible to cut them where they then lay. Some of them weighed many tons, and
            would have required immense labor to place them there, and that too without an apparent
            object. The natural inference was, that they had fallen down from the summit of the
            mountain after the sculptures were made on them. A few only seemed recent; the others
            bore the marks of great antiquity. Like most of the rude Indian sculptures or mark- ings
            which I have seen, I do not think these possess any historic value, as many suppose.

            an animal such as he sees ; another makes one according to his own fancy ; and a third
            amuses himself with devising grotesque or unmeaning figures of other sorts. Hence we
            find these sculptured rocks in large num- bers in prominent places. . We all had the
            luxury of a bath here ; and though the water was quite warm, we found it very
            refreshing. We made a practice of bathing wherever we could find water, believing it a
            better preservative of health than any thing else. June 22 d. The heat had been so
            oppressive both to the men and animals since leavincf Fort Yuma, that I determined to

            was un- comfortably cool. We ascended the plateau to cut off a bend of the river; and
            after keeping on it for four or five miles, we again desended into the bottom, cutting
            away a bank in order to reach it. The plateau was as dreary and desolate as before,
            stretching away as far as the eye could reach to the south in one vast plain,
            interrupted at intervals of ten or twenty miles with isolated moun- tains rising
            abruptly from it. The road now became better, as it wound throusrh a dense thicket of

            It was an agreeable change from the utter barrenness and parching heat of the table-land
            to find ourselves now in a thick wood. After passing the northern ter- mination of " Big

            mules found a supply of cane on the margin of the river, with which, and twigs of

            is proportion ably shallow and filled with sand-bars. June 23d. A violent wind arose
            last night, which made it necessary to put out guys to our tents to pre- vent their'
            blowing down. A great change in the atmosphere took place at the same time, so that when
            I awoke, I found perspiration checked, and was suffer- ing from a severe pain in the
            head. Others were simi- larly affected. Left camp at five, a. m., and soon after
            ascended the table-land, over which we travelled nine miles, the river as before making
            a large bend to the north. We could trace its course from the bright green line _ of
            cotton-woods and willows, as it wound away through the desert. Passed the grave of an
            emigrant by the road side, his name being written with a pencil on a strip of board and

            which we followed for about nine miles. We descend- ed where the valley seemed to expand

            which had been dug to obtain it. We found the water in these holes quite brackish, and
            unfit to drink ; consequently we were obliged to send our animals about a mile and a
            half through the wood to the river, from which we also brought water for our own use. So
            thick was the wood, that it was found impracticable to force our wagons through. This
            was the most beautiful spot we had encamped in since leaving the little valley of San

            protection in the thick and overlianging willows, the leaves of which extended to the

            for ourselves, every luxury that a camp life affords. Accordingly, as the sun began to
            throw its long shadows across the hills, and when about half an hour of * daylight
            remained, we moved from camp. The road was pretty good and less sandy than before. We
            did not now take the table-land, but kept on a lower ter- race, which seemed to lead
            along the spur of a dark rocky hill, until we "\yere suddenly brought to a stand. The
            river had washed away the terrace, and left no passage. We were therefore obliged to
            retrace our steps a short distance, and pass over the hills, which were exceedingly,
            rocky, and overgrown with cacti. Not being able to discern the smaller ones among the
            rocks, the mules were several times stopped by coming in contact with their thorns. From
            one poor creature the blood flowed as though hfe had been purposely bled this many of

            stop, as it was impossible to find our Avay through the light and deep sand in which we
            then were. The. packs were accord- ingly removed from the mules, although the saddles
            were left on ; and the wagon-mules were tied to the mezquit bushes near. We then lay
            down on the bare sand just where we were, and, rolling our blankets around us, for it
            was quite cool, slept soundly until daylight. June 25tk With the break of day we were
            again off, having no mules to catch, no tents to strike, or breakfast to get. In an hour
            and a half we struck a 202 rORT YUMA sluice of the river, wliere we encamped. There was
            no appearance of grass here ; but with plenty of wil- lows and cotton- wood, the animals
            seemed content. As we were all fatigued from our night's journey, we threw ourselves on
            the. sand, and, after a couple of hours' sleep, awoke quite refreshed, and ready for our
            coffee and breakfast. All about us we found signs that a large encamp- ment of Americans
            had been here, with indications of a cache. These were the tires of two* wheels
            straight- ened and inserted so deeply in the ground that they could not be withdrawn.
            They were probably land marks, from which bearings had been taken and dis measured.
            There had evidently been a great breaking up of wagons and destruction of property here.
            The day was very hot, and rendered more oppressive by the bare sand around us. The
            bottom land was broad, and but partially wooded. Near us was a sluice, which had been
            filled when the river was high, or it may have been a bend of the river through which
            the water had flowed. We did not see the river. Just before sunset, we resumed our
            journey, eontmu- ing a few miles along the river bottom where the road was good. We then
            ascended about one hundred and twenty feet to a plateau, up a very steep arid rocky way,
            where I much feared our wagons would be crush- ed ; but by the soldiers taking hold, and
            every man pushing and pulling, we at length surmounted the hill- The road was now hard
            and smooth, until we came to an arroyo, which we had to descend, and then cross over
            steep and rocky hills, which again endangered the wagons. On reaching the crest of the
            table-land, Si TO THE COCO-MARICOPA VILLAGES. ' 203 where we descendecL to the second
            terrace or bottom, F we saw numerous fragments of trunks, boxes, clothing, wagons, with
            human bones and skulls, showing that it had been the scene of soilie terrible disaster.
            A soldier of the escort from Fort Yuma revealed to us the mystery. In March of last year
            (1851) a party of emigrants, the continent, stopped at the Pimo villages. Among them was
            a Mr. Oatman and his family, con- sisting of his wife, two daughters from 12 to 15 years
            of age, and a son of 12 years. Mr. 0. had with him one or more wagons, and a variety of
            merchandise; and, contrary to the advice of his, friends, he set oif from the village in
            advance, the rest of the party not being ready to accompany him. Some days after, his
            little son found his way back to the Pimo Indians, a distance of some seventy miles,
            having crossed a de- sert of forty -five miles without water on his way. He reported
            that the party had been attacked by In- dians, his father and mother killed, and his
            sisters car- ried off. He himself had been badly beaten by the savages and left for
            dead. After lying some time, he revived ; when he saw the mangled bodies of his pa-
            rents before him, his sisters gone, and the wagon plun- dered of its contents. The party
            soon after set out on their journey, accompanied by the lad and some Maricopa Indians.
            On arriving at the scene of the disaster, they covered the remains of llr. Oatman and
            his wife with stones (for it was impossible to di grave), and then continued their
            journey to Fort Yu- ma, where they informed Major Heintzelman of the occurrence. The
            Major immediately despatched a party of sol- 204 FORT YUMA diers witli provisions for
            those still behind, and with orders to scour the country, and endeavor, if possible, to
            recover the missing girls. But they saw no Indians, nor has it yet been ascertained by
            what tribe the out- rag:e was committed. We readied the valley again at 11 p. M., wlien
            we stopped for the remainder of the night, and lay down on the sand to get a few hours
            sleep. The air was so dry and hot, that tents were unnecessary. June 2Qth. Finding no
            grass, cane, or bushes near us on which the animals could feed, we moved off, soon after
            4 o'clock, with the break of day. Our route now lay across'a bed of sand so light that
            the wheels sank deep, rendering it necesary to double one of the teams before we could
            pass it. Even with the aid of this device, it was slow work. It now became necessary to
            cross the Gila, as the plateau rose abruptly from the margin of the river, not leaving a
            passage wide enough for a mule. Our route had hitherto been wholly on ¥ ■ the south side
            since leaving the Colorado. I do not think the north side would present as good a road ;
            besides which, it would be necessary, if the north bank should be followed, to cross the
            Gila at its mouth, as the Colorado cannot be forded above the junction. The river where
            we crossed was about three feet deep in the channel. After getting over, we had to
            traverse another half mile of deep sand, and then recross, to get on the southern bank
            once more. At the second crossing my wagon sank so deep in a quick- ddl sand, that the
            mules, after struggling in vain to p out, broke the traces and left me alone in the ni:
            of the stream. It was necessary to attach four mules TO THE COCO-MARICOPA VILLAGES. 205

            order to examine some sculptured rocks of which I had heard, I left camp at 5 o'clock p.
            m. accompanied by Doctor Webb, in advance of the train. After cross- ing a plain for
            about five miles, we reached the object of our search, which consisted of a pile of
            large boul- ders, heaped up some forty or fifty feet above the plain, and standing
            entirely alone. Such of these rocks as present ' smooth sides ' are covered with
            sculptures, rudely pecked in, of animals and men, as well as of various figures,
            apparently without meaning. There are hundreds of.them so ornamentedj showing that the
            place has long been the resort of the Indians for this purpose ; for there seems to be
            nothing else to attract them here. Many of the inscriptions, like those before
            described, bear the stamp of great age, others having been made over them repeatedly,
            rendering it impos- sible to trace out either the early or the later mark- ings. I
            selected thirteen, of which I 'made copies. By this time the shades of night were
            falling about- us; and the train having already passed, it was necessary to hasten on to
            overtake it. I regretted that I could not spend the day in this interesting locality, in
            order to copy more of the sculptures, as well as to make a closer examination of the
            many recesses among the rocks. I do not attempt any explanation of these rude figures,
            but must leave the reader to exercise his own ingenuity in finding out their meaning, if
            any. Leaving this place we entered an arroyo of gravel, and after following it for two
            or three miles, e ascended a very difiicult and rocky hill to the plateau. BCULrrrr.KU

            night, and evinced much fatigue, I concluded to ■ remain here during the day to give
            them rest. Our camp was in a very dense 'thicket of willows and cotton-woods near the
            river's bank, into which we cut our way with axes. Here we had an admirable retreat,
            whose recesses the rays of the sun could not penetrate ; and we passed the day with some
            degree of comfort. The Gila rippled close by ; and a deep hole bein attractions for

            with several fine fish. In the night we were aroused by the firing of a bed, believing

            his rifle out from a pile of saddles with the muzzle towards him, having caught the
            trigger and discharged it. The stupid fellow narrowly escaped with his life, for the
            ball passed through his hand. Soon after five o'clock, p. m., we resumed our jour- ney ;
            and after a march of eight miles across a bend, 208 FOBT YUMA H we again struck the
            river near a point wliere our sur- veying parties had had a station, and had remained
            several days. There we found an abundance of mez- quit and willows, but no appearance of
            grass. • Near us was a sluice, which a year before was the main brancn of the river, the
            stream having since found another channel. We bivouacked at this place, doubtful whe-
            ther we. should find as good feed for the mules by proceeding further, the mezquit beans
            being now m the best state for the animals, June 2dtk Before the sun had risen we were
            again on our way, intending to stop at the last water- ing place, five or six miles in
            advance. My desire was to keep the animals fresh and in good condition for the march
            across the long desert which lay before us, and to give the soldiers a day's rest before
            setting out. The Gila here makes a bend to the north, and is not again seen from the
            road until it reaches the Coco-Maricopa villages, forty-five miles distant. - there is
            no water the whole distance, the journey must be made in one march, without stopping ;
            to prepare for it, therefore, we encamped for the' day in a mez- quit grove near the
            river. • The kegs and canteens \Yere filled with water pre- paratory for the journey;
            and in order to give the soldiers a little the start of us, they set off at four
            o'clock. The train left an hour and a half later, our course being east by north. We
            entered at once upon the great plateau or desert, where the road was leve and hard. The
            animals moved off at a quick gait, an had seemingly got the idea that they were appr* '
            grassy fields. About fifteen miles brou ht TO THE COCO-MARICOPA VILLAGES. 209 a
            mountaiii range whicli had long loomed up before us, and seemed to present an impassable
            barrier to our progress; but as we drew near, what appeared at a distance to be
            continuous, now showed many passages through, of easy access, and with an ascent so
            gradual as to be scarcely apparent. The great mountain chain, as it seemed to us to be,
            was in reality a collec- tion of detached ridges and isolated mountains rising abruptly
            from the desert. We were accordingly able to keep on our course, winding through these
            mountains with scarcely an ascent or descent worth naming. The road was excellent
            through all the defiles; although there were many small gullies requiring care in cross-
            ing, and which shows that there are very heavy rains here at times. The vegetation on
            this desert is the same as on the several portions we had from time to time passed over
            in our journey from the Colorado. .The great cereus here raises its lofty head above all
            other plants, attain- ing its greatest perfection in this barren and desolate region. We
            passed several of gigantic dimensions, and others of a variety of forms, exhibiting
            singular contortions. If one unused to these remarkable plants should suddenly be
            brought to this place, where he would see before him a vast plain studded with thou-
            sands of these cacti, many of which rise to the height of twenty or thirty feet, in a
            single stem without a branch, he would be very likely, particularly if he saw them as we
            did by moonlight, to imagine himself in the midst of the ruins of a magnificent palace,
            the columns of which were alone left standing. The lesser plants, thinly scattered over
            the plain, are a dwarfish VOL. n. — 14 n 210 FORT YUMA mezquit and larrea Mexicana,

            me ; for up to this time I had been in advance. I had observed before, that in long
            marches, when the wagon-mules Tecame fatigued, those with packs would quicken their
            pace. My wagon-mules, unwilling to be left, increased their pace, and T allowed them to
            keep just far enough behind the packs to avoid the dust As there was no stopping the
            pack-mules without relieving them ot their burdens, Mr. Leroux said it would be far
            better to push on until we reached the water aiid grass ; and I determined with my
            little wagon to keep with him. It was now about two o'clock, and the soldiers as well as
            the horsemen were so much fatigued, that the wagons were stopped, and all threw
            themselves down just as they were to get a little rest on the bare desert, hitching
            their mules to their waists by their long lariats. I left them," and hastened forward
            with Mr. Leroux and the packs. June 30tJi. At daylight we passed the south end of range
            of mountains which extend to the Gila, termt- nating near the mouth of the Salinas River
            ; and at halt -past six we reached some water-holes, about a mile from the first
            Coco-Maricopa village, thus making the journey of forty-five miles in thirteen hours.
            This may be con- sidered slow in the age of locomotives and steamers, or even with
            stage-coaches ; but with a train of emaci- ated pack-mules, each carrying on his back
            two hun- dred and fifty pounds weight, and going the who e •distance without a particle
            of food or water, it is som thing of a feat. k " TO THE COCO-MAEICOPA TILLAGES. 211 It
            was indeed a pleasant sight to find ourselves once more surrounded by luxuriant grass.
            Altliougli we had met with a little salt grass in one or two places on the march, which
            no animal would eat if he could get any thing else, we had not seen a patch of good
            grass since leaving our camp at San Isabel, fifty-six miles from San Diego. At Vallecita
            and Carrizo Creek it is indifferent. As it would yet be several hours before we could
            look for the wagons and the remainder of the party, we turned the mules out to luxuriate
            on the rich pasture before them, and creeping under some mezquit bushes soon fell
            asleep, rest being more desirable than food. The wagons with the rest of the party,
            including the escort, came in at half-past ten. We nov' got out all the tents, and
            arranged our camp with much care, as we were to be here for some days, to await the
            arri- val of Lieutenant Whipple and the surveying party. We selected a spot in which
            there was a pretty grove of mezquit bushes, and there we pitched the tents. The water
            here is found in several holes, from four to six feet below the surface, which were dug
            by Colonel Cooke on his march to California. In some of these holes the water is
            brackish, in others very pure. The Gila passes about two miles to the north ; for one
            half of which distance the grass extends, the other half being loose sand. Major Emory,
            in his report,* re- commends parties going to California by this route not to cross the
            plateau which we had just come over, but to keep to the river, as " the journey is but •

            trifle longer." TKe accounts on which he bases this r recommendation were erroneous, the
            route along the river being more than double the distance, as reported to me by the
            engineers whose duties required them to follow it. It is besides thickly wooded, and
            would pre- sent difficulties to wagons, and even to pack-mules; whereas the road over
            the plateau which we took is excellent all the way. It is also proper to state, that
            Lieutenant Whipple and Mr. Gray found the bend of the river to be much greater than it
            is laid down by Major Emory on his map.* . . * Mr. Gray in his official letter to the
            Secretary of the Interior, from San Diego, relatingto the survey of the Gila, says, that
            " many errors of others who had been along this river, in astronomical observationSj
            were corrected by Lieutenant Whipple." — Senate Doc. JVo. 119; 32a Coriff. 1st Session
            p. 307. It may be mentioned in this connection, that the survey of the Boundary
            Commission brought to light two important geographical facts. One was, that the
            Colorado, after receiving the Gila, tates a sudden turn of seven or eight miles to the
            westward before resuming its southerly direction, which turn gives the United States
            both banks of the river. The other was the error in laying down the great bend jusi
            below the mouth of the Salinas, Yet both these supposed discoveries were made by Father
            Kino before the year 1700, although theynever obtained a place in the maps.; for in
            speaking of this eminent mission- ary and geographical explorer, Alegrc says : " En este

            The most active and man among them was a chief named Francisco Pukey. He had been in

            they had picked up suffi Spanish to make themselves understood. •1 214 ' THE
            COCO-MARICOPA AND I told them we wanted vegetables, fruit, green corn, and mules; for
            which we would pay them in white cotton cloth, calico, red flannel and other shirts,-
            blankets, and trinkets. _ Thej generally raise a great many fine melons ; but it was too
            early yet for them. They brought us green corn, squashes, beans, and dried peas. "We
            also bought of them some dried corn (maize) for the animals. The culinary department, as
            usual, seemed to have most attractions for our Indian friends, who formed a double row
            around the fire while cooking was going on. They also crowded into the tents," and
            occupied' all the space about them. When night came, we expected they would leave ; but
            they stretched them- selves out on the grass, and passed the night in the camp. June
            ZQth. As the heat was intense, the mercury ranging from 100° to 110°, and as we had very
            Httle shade, 'it was thought advisable to get nearer the river, where there were more
            trees, and where the men would have a better opportunity to bathe, a lux- ury which they
            had enjoyed every day since lea Fort Yuma. The Indians told me we had better remain
            where we were, as there was no grass near river. I felt- disposed to listen to them ;
            but such the desire of the party to be on the water that I sented ,to go, and gave
            orders to strike the tents in T the diately after breakfast. By eight o'clock we set
            off, under the guidance of Francisco, and followed by fifty or sixty more of his tribe.
            After crossing a deep arroyo of sand, which is filled by the river at its floods, and
            pushing our way • THE PIMO INDIANS. 215 through a thick underbrush of willows, we at
            length reached the bank of the river, when I found the state- ments of the Indians too
            true. There were many fine large cotton-wood trees, beneath which we stopped, •and
            whit;h afforded us a good shade from the scorching rays of the sun ; but there was not a
            blae of grass to . be seen, and, what was worse, the. Gila was dry ! We crossed and
            recrossed its bed without wetting the soles of our shoes ; although by digging a couple'
            of .feet, we found water for ourselves and our animals. We now turned the animals loose
            to browse upon the twigs of the willows and cotton-woods, as there was no other food for
            them ; and I sent Mr. Leroux up the stream, in search of the two great desiderata for
            the party, grass and water, and shade if it was to be found. In three or four hours,
            after making a diligent search through the bottom, he returned and reported that the
            river was dry as far as he had followed it, and that he had met with no grass. In fact,
            he was told by the Indians, that we should find no grass until we passed the Pimo
            villages, from twelve to fifteen miles beyond. It was so hot and dry where we wjere,
            that we did . not pitch our tents, having concluded to retrace our stops in the morning
            to our first camp at the The dryness of the river was produced by the having been turned
            off by the Ind their lands, for which the whole stream seemed barely sufficient. It is
            probable, however, that, with more economical management, it might be made to go much
            further. A party of the Coco-Maricopas remained with us 216 THE COCO-MARICOPA AXD T '
            to-day, wlio "were to set off in tlie morning on an expe- dition against their enemies,
            the Apaches, north of the Salinas. They were gajly dressed, as is the universal custom
            of the Iiidians on such occasions, and mounted on good-looking horses. The chiefs who
            wer6 to lead the band begged hard of me to lend them a few rifles with the necessary
            ammunition ; which I had to refuse. As an additional inducement, which they thought I
            could not refuse, they offered to bring me a live Apache boy, and a girl too, if I
            wished ; but havii no desire for such additions to our party, I was com pelled to
            decline the generous proposal. . July Ist Our Indian friends composing the war party
            were up at daylight preparing for a start. They seemed to be supplied with small loaves
            of bread and dried meat, of which they made their morning's meal. They then decorated
            themselves with all the finery they could muster. Most of them had shirts of white
            cotton or red flannel, Avhich they had obtained of us, and which they seemed to regard
            as the beau-ideal of a dress, without the addition of any other garment. Such as had
            their own "cotton blankets, placed them around their bodies in folds, and over this-
            wound the lariats as tight as possible ; for the double purpose, suppose, of bracing
            their bodies, and of protecting their vital parts from arrows. Those who possessed
            neither shirts nor blankets, remained as nature made I them, with the addition of a
            little paint. On tli head dresses, they had all bestowed more attent than on their
            bodies. Some had them plastered w clay, so as to resemble huge turbans. Others h
            decorated the great club of hair which hung down th THE PIMO INDIANS. 217 their backs
            with bits of scarlet cloth, but more of them with the richlj-figured sashes or belts of
            their own manufacture. Some again wore their hair in braids tastefully wound around
            their heads, intermin- I gled with pieces of scarlet cloth ; while a few, less par-
            ticular as to their appearance, wore it clubbed up behind in a huge mass. .The manes and
            tails of their horses were also set off with bits of white and red clotli. Their arms
            were solely the bow and arrow : most of them had a skin quiver hung across their backs ;
            though a few carried their arrows in their gir- dles. There was quite an exciting time
            as the party were about to start; and several of the Commission desired to take their
            rifles and accompany them, a request which was of course refused. Wishing to get back to
            our old camp in the cool of the morning, we did not wait for breakfast, but were off by
            five o'clock, and, after another hard tug through the sand, reached the camping ground,
            where we had every thing we could ask for, except shade, and water to bathe in. The
            latter was the greatest deprivation. The tents were again pitched, and the camp arranged
            as it was on the day of our arrival The Indians again flocked around us, and in greater
            numbers than before. The Pimos having heard of our arrival, many of them came also,
            bringing such vege- tables a they had, together with pi7ioh, made both from wheat and
            corn. Some of the pinole was sweet- ened with the flour of mezquit beans, which they
            also brought separate in small earthen vases, or olios, as the Mexicans call them. The
            mezquit flour, which is ground very fine, has a sickish sweetness ; so that, although I
            % 218 THE COCO-MARICOPA AND became fond of the beans in the pod, and liked to pick them
            from the trees as we rode along, I could not eat them when drj and converted into flour.
            They also brought us the fruit of the petaJiayd rolled up in masses or balls as large as
            one's fist. In this state it resem- bles in appearance the pulp of figs, and has
            something of the same taste mingled with that of the raspberry. We had gathered some as
            we came along the Gila, but had found none so good as this. All became very fond of it,
            and our Indian friends found a ready sale for all they brought. Jars of molasses
            extracted from the same were also offered for sale. I inquired of the Indians to-day
            what they knew of the murder of the Oatman family before mentioned; They remembered the
            affair well ; indeed one of the chiefs present had accompanied the party after the
            committal of the murder. His statement corresponded with" what I have related. They
            charged the Tonto Apaches with the crime, and said, " With Grods per- mission, we will
            retake the two children, and restore them to the Americans." I told them they should he
            well rewarded, if they would do so ; and that if so for- tunate as to recover them, they
            might take them to the American Fort (Yuma) on the Colorado ; or if they could not carry
            them there, to the Mexican com- manding officer at Tucson. Among the Maricopas, I
            noticed to-day three whom I had seen in Ures when there last winter, and to whom I had
            given notes of recommendation. They now showed them to me carefully wrapped up in s*,
            envelopes, and deposited in a bag of black skin. A the chiefs, both Pimos and
            Coco-Maricopas, have let- THE PIMO INDIANS. 219 ters which they have obtained from

            prize these certificates very highly. July 2d, This morning, Francisco, the Maricopa in-
            terpreter, breakfasted with me, and, from his ease at table, showed that he had been
            among civilized people before. He was well dressed, having on pantaloons, a shirt, and
            hat. He is a man of much intelligence and shrewdness, and expressed a desire to serve
            us. The Americans who had been through these villages before, he said, had given his
            people very little, although they had done much for them. They had brought the Americans
            wood and water, and had acted as guides, sometimes accompanying them many miles, and he

            THE COCO-MARICOPA AND There was one practice of this chief that was not so agreeable to
            me, namely, that of helping his friends to the choicest bits from my table. When we took
            our places, they all assembled, and sat or stood gaping around. Francisco, during the
            meal, occasionally hand- ed them a piece of bread or meat ; and when we had finished, he
            coolly piled up his plate, and passed it around among his friends. At first, I was
            rather amused at the fellow's impudence ; but on a subse- quent occasion, he carried the
            joke still further, not only giving them what he had collected on his own plate, but
            stripping the table of all that remained, so as to leave nothing for my cook and
            servant. As our sup- ply of provisions was limited, I had no idea of feed- ing so many

            that he did not have a seat at my 'table. I told him, finally, that it was not the
            custom Americans, when they asked a friend to their table, to feed his whole tribe. • '
            This man afterwards became- quite a bore to us; for nothing would satisfy his avarice. I
            gave him shirts, pantaloons, white cotton, and calico, besides beads and ti'inkets for
            his wife and children. Lieut. Paige, also, made him some valuable presents ; but he
            constantly asked for more, and was most importunate for whiskey. I told him we had none
            ; but this he seemed to doubt, ■declaring that we were the first party of Americans he

            of his search. Much harm has been done by Americans in giving this poor and
            simple-hearted people intoxicating drinks ; and it is a matter of satisfaction to me to
            state, that in my long intercourse with the Indians here, as well as at the Copper Mines
            with the Apaches, none ever got a drop of liquor from me, or from my camp to my
            knowledge. In the evening, while a crowd of Indians were lying or squatting around my
            tent, I had a long talk with a Maricopa, whose name I forget (but who spoke Span- ish
            well), on the manners and customs of his people. This man was terribly crippled, having
            a year before been engaged in a fight with the Yumas, in which his party was defeated.
            He was lanced in many places, beaten with clubs, his hair cut off, and left for dead.
            After the combatants had left, he revived, and by some means succeeded in getting home.
            He was still unable to walk, except with a long stajQf, but had to be lifted on his
            horse, and rode about with some diffi- culty. He was quite an intelligent man, and,
            while we remained, was constantly in our camp. He said the Coco-Maricopas came here not
            many years before, to escape from the Yumas, with whom they were constantly at war, and
            by whom they had been greatly reduced in numbers. Their former range was along the
            valley of the Gila, on the opposite side 222 THE COCO-MARICOPA AND of the Jornada and
            towards the Colorado. Their pre- sent position adjoining the Pimos, was chosen for the
            benefit of mutual protection. This people, restrict themselves to a single wife. Their
            ideas of a Supreme Being, in whose existence they believe, are of so vague a nature that
            I could not ascertain them with exactness. After death, they believe that their souls go
            to the banks of the Colorado, their ancient dwelling-place, and there take refuge in the
            great sand hills, where they are metamorphosed into various animals and birds. Their
            heads, hands, feet, etc., each become owls, bats, wolves, and other animals. They
            believe, too, that the souls of their ene- mies, the Yumas, also find a place there ;
            and that the wars which have so lonar existed between them on earth, will be continued
            there, after death. When a man desires to marry, and has made choice of a girl for his
            wife, he first endeavors to win over her parents by milking them presents. The fair ones
            attention is sought by another process. To do this, be takes his flute, an instrument of
            cane with four holes, and, seating himself beneath a bush near her dwell- ing, keeps up
            a plaintive noise for hours together. This music is continued day after day ; and if no
            notice is at length taken of him by the girl, he may "hang up his flute," as it is
            tantamount to a rejec- tion. If the proposal is agreeable, the fair one makes it known
            to the suitor, when the conquest is considered complete. No girl is forced to marry
            against her will, however eligible her parents may consider the match. Whenever a girl
            marries, it is expec ted I that her husband will present her parents with as mnc THE

            of the work. Besides taking care of the children and attending to the house- hold
            matters, they grind the corn, make baskets, gather mezquit beans, help till the "ground,
            and sometimes spin and weave. The men plant and gather the crops, and take care of the

            and comes hard on the poor women, who are obliged to get upon their knees, and exert the

            seen women thus em- ployed when the thermometer stood at 110°, while their lords lay
            stretched out at length on their backs looking on. Water is invariably brought by the
            women in large earthen vessels upon their heads resting upon a small cushion. Some of
            these vessels hold six gallons. This mode of carrying burdens, by which the body is kept
            in a perfectly erect position, tends greatly to develope the chest and add to the
            general beauty of the figure. Hence we see among the Indians, as well as among the lower
            class of Mexicans, forms which Walker might well have taken for models in his " Analysis
            of Beauty in Women." As the manners and customs of the Pimos and Coco-Maricopas are the
            same, with the exception of their rites of burial, T shall include both in describing
            these customs ; although there is little doubt but that the knowledge of the arts which
            they possess originated with the Pimos. Cotton is raised by them,* which they spin and
            weave. Their only manufactures consist of blankets of various textures and sizes ; a
            heavy cloth of the same material used by the women to put around their loins ; and an
            article from three to four inches wide, used as a band for the head, or a girdle for the
            waist. The blankets are woven with large threads, slightly twisted and without any nap.
            They are made of white cotton, and are without ornament of colors or figures, save a
            narrow selvage of buff. * I brought home with me the seeds with samples of this cotton,
            which was pronounced equal to the best Sea Island. The seeds I diet- tributed among
            various planters. I ! * ■r: THE PIMO INDIANS, 225 The implements used by these tribes
            for spinning and weaving are of the most primitive character. A slender stick about two
            feet long passing through a block of wood which serves to keep up the momentum imparted
            to it, constitutes the spindle. One end of this rests on a wooden cup inserted between
            the toes, Indian weaving. and the other is held and twirled by the fingers of the yight

            alternate thread of the warp is passed round a piece of cane, which, being lifted, opens
            a passage for the shut- tle in the manner of a slej. The operator sits in the fashion of
            a tailor, and, raising the sley with one hand, with the other passes the shuttle, which
            is simply a pointed stick with the thread wound upon it, between the threads of the
            warp. The work is beaten up after the passage of each thread by the use of a sharp
            smooth- edged instrument made of hard wood. The operation of course progresses slowly ;
            and from the length of time consumed in spinning and weaving, they set a high price upon
            their blankets, asking for them ten or twelve dollars in money, or a new woollen blanket
            of equal size. The weaving is generally done by the old men. The head-band or girdle
            consists of a white ground with a variety of figures of red, blue, and buff. The figures
            are angular, and, though they present a great variety, are all of one general character.
            The colored portions of these belts are made of wool, and the colors are quite
            brilliant. On examining the patterns on these bands, one is struck with their general
            resemblance to the figures on the ancient pottery found among the ruins of this country,
            a cojnparison with which will be made hereafter. The pottery made by these tribes is all
            red or dark brown, the latter a blending of black and red. The articles made are very
            limited, though, perhaps, qiite sufficient for their wants. In fact, they are the same
            as those made and in use by the Mexicans. They con- sist of ollas, or vases, of every
            size, the largest holding THE PlilO INDIANS 227 about two pailfuUs, and the smallest
            half a pint ; jars with small apertures, resembling bottles ; basins of dif- ferent
            sizes and forms, from that of a milk-pan to a saucer ; and oblong vessels of small
            dimensions used as dippers. All these vessels are painted or ornamented with black lines
            arranged in geometrical figures, and of a character resembling those on the head-bands.
            Baskets and Pottery of the Pimos and Coco-Maricopas. r The basket work of this people is
            remarkably well ade of willow twigs, and so close as to be impervious to water. The
            baskets are of various shapes, and are Jised for different purposes. Those of a large
            basin- ike form are the most common. These they carry on tbeir heads filled with corn or
            other articles. Like 228 THE COCO-MARICOPA AND tlie pottery, they are ornamented with
            geometrical figures, arranged with much taste. The dress of the Coco-Maricopas and the
            Pimos is the same. The women fold the smaller blankets or other cloths, and pass them
            around their loins, letting them hang to their knees. They are sometimes fastened with
            one of the belts before mentioned, but are generally kept in place by simply tucking one
            end in. Sandals of raw hide are worn on the feet. No- thing is worn on the head, nor is

            women. One boy in particular, who might pass for a dandy among them, wore some twenty or
            more strings of beads. The body, arms, and legs of the women are naked. They generally
            have fine forms; for which they are indebted, as I have before remarked, to their mode
            of carrying bur- dens on their heads. In this respect, there is a marked difference
            between them and the men, who are gener- 'ally lean and lank, with very small limbs and
            narrow chests. Their labor is so light, and they keep so closely to their villages or
            the immediate vicinity, that there is no opportunity for physical development. The men
            in general go naked, except the breech- cloth, A few, however, are provided with their
            native blankets of large size, which they fold and throw over their shoulders in the
            manner of the Mexicans. Some fasten them around their waists in graceful folds, letting
            the ends fall to their knees ; then drawing a cord between their legs and attaching it
            to their waists, their garment resembles a capacious pair of pantaloons. I suppose that
            all are provided with cotton blankets ; but, owing to the almost incessant heat of the
            day, they seldom wear them. At night, when cool, these constitute their sole covering.
            The head-band is worn by nearly all the men gracefully put on in several folds, with the
            braided ends hanging down to their shoul- ders. They also have a large woollen cord,
            from half an inch to an inch in diameter, of different colors, which they use as a head
            ornament, twining it around the hair. So many Americans have been among these people,
            that most of them have obtained ragged or ■fL 230 THE COCO-MARICOPA AND cast-ofiF
            shirts, which they put on on great occasions, By their traffic with the Boundary
            Commission, they obtained a large number of these garments of a good substantial quality
            both cotton and woollen. The bright scarlet shirts gave them quite a picturesque appear-
            ance. When they visited our camp, every man put on his best garments, no matter what was
            their fashion, or how many he had. I remember that on one occa- sion Francisco made his
            appearance in a pair of panta- loons, with a white shirt, over which was a checked' one,
            and another of red flannel outside of that. For a short time he strutted about the camp,
            the envy and admiration of his friends. But he soon got tired of sporting such a dress
            with the heat at 110°; and shortly after we saw him cooling off on the grass, divested
            of all his finery, which he had carefully tied up in a bundle. The men wear their hair
            long, never cutting it except across the eyebrows, down to which it hangs, and thus
            partially protects the eyes. When loosed, their hair teaches to their knees; but usually
            it is clubbed up in a large mass on their backs. Their ear- locks either hang loose, or
            are braided in several strands, with little ornaments of bone, tin, or red cloth
            attached to them. But the decoration of their heads with the bands of which I have
            spoken, forms the most picturesque part of their costume. They have a sin- gular
            practice of filling their hair with clay ; so that when dry it resembles a great turban.
            I could not imagine their object in adopting so filthy a custom, unless it was to
            destroy the vermin. The men also wear a profusion of beads when they can obtain them.
            THE PIMO INDIANS. 231 61 Some have long strings of sea-shells or parts of shells, which
            are highly prized. I tried to buy some of them ; but the only man at all disposed to
            sell asked me five dollars or a pair of blankets for a few strings, a price so
            extravagant that I declined to make the purchase. The women carry their infants in
            cradles similar to those of other Indians. I have seen them in camp with a basket of
            green corn on their heads,' and on the top of this the cradle and child. When it gets to
            be about a year old, it is carried astride on the hip, the mother holding one arm around
            its body. Although the men and boys go naked, I never saw a girl, how- ever young,
            without clothes around its hips similar to those worn by the women. The Indians were
            much amused by Dr. Webb's col- lection of insects, reptiles, and small mammalia, which
            were preserved in bottles or hanging about our tent. I told the boys to go out and
            collect for us any curious insects, lizards, or snakes they could find, and that I would
            reward them for so doing. Instead of letting the boys go, the men, in the belief that
            they would be well rewarded, went themselves, and in a few hours came very earnestly to
            my tent with a few grasshop- pers and crickets. Although utterly valueless, as con-
            taining nothing new, yet Dr. Webb graciously re- jment to prosecute their zoological
            researches further, at the same time inform- ing his new recruits that lizards and
            horned frogs, which abound on the plateau, would be most accept- able. They now set off
            again, and we hoped some- thing better from this second effort. About an hour after,
            some half-a-dozen sturdy fellows marched to- ceived them, as an encourag 232 THE

            leader advanced with a dignified air, and the Doctor got his bottles ready to receive
            the specimens which the six men had collected. But his expectations, if he indulged any,
            of adding new species to his collection, soon vanished, when the man laid upon the table
            two small lizards, minus their fails; which had been broken off in securing them. For
            their lous services in the cause of science, the captors ard of the tailless lizards
            coolly demanded a shirt apiece. Two old chiefs made their appearance to-day, and at once
            recognised Mr. Leroux as the person who guided Colonel Cooke and his battalion through
            here in 1847. Mr. Leroux also recognised one whom they called Blanco, as a chief who
            commanded the Marico- pas twenty-five years ago, when a party of hunters and trappers
            from New Mexico, among whom was Leroux, had a severe fis-ht with them, and escaped of
            wly with their lives. On being reminded oi the old chief recollected the circumstances,
            which he related, and which corresponded with th Leroux. The valley or bottom-land
            occupied by the Pimos and Coco-Maricopas extends about fifteen miles along the south
            side of the Gila, and is from two to four miles in width, nearly the whole being
            occupied by their villages and cultivated fields. The Pimos occupy the eastern portion.
            There is no dividing line between them, nor any thing to distinguish the villages of one
            from the other. The whole of this plain is intersected by irrigating canals from the

            most luxuriant crops. * At the .western end of tlie valley is .a rich tract of grass,
            where we had our encampment. This is a mile or more from the nearest village of the
            Coco-Maricopas. On the northern side of the river there is less bottom-land, and the
            irriga- tion is more difficult. There are a few cultivated spots here ; but it is too
            much exposed to the attacks of their enemies for either tribe to reside upon it. The
            villages consist of groups of from twenty to fifty habitations, surrounded by gardens
            and cultivated fields, intersected in every direction by acequias, which lead the water
            from the Gila. Their mode of irriga- tion is the same as that practised in various parts
            of Mexico. Their cultivated fields are generally fenced with crooked stakes, wattled
            with brush, the thorny mezquit predominating; although I noticed large patches of wheat,
            a long distance from any village, that were not inclosed. Their houses are built with
            stakes, poles, .corn- shucks, and straw. For the small houses, four upright stakes
            forked at one end are inserted in the ground. For the larger dwellings nine are used ;
            three on each side, and one in the centre. Across the tops of these, other sticks are
            laid to support the roof. Next a row of poles is inserted in the ground, a few feet
            outside the larger upright stakes, bent over towards the centre and fastened to the
            horizontal beams. These are then united in the centre, forming a slightly rounded top.
            Smaller poles are now horizontally interlaced with the upright ones, and between them
            straw, corn-shucks, or rushes are interwoven in large masses, so as to shed the rain and
            protect them from the intense heat of the 234 THE COCO-ilARICOPA AND sun ; some are

            Lieutenant Whipple and party, I determined to take a short trip up the river Sail mas,
            as far as the " Casas Grandes," or ancient remains said to be there. I asked a couple of
            Mari- copas to go with me as guidfes, and offered them a red flannel shirt each for
            their services. They wished two others to accompany them, if I would take them on the
            same terms. Finding that I consented so readily, they parleyed a while, and then
            demanded for each a shirt, six yards of cotton, and sundry small articles, without which
            they declared they would not go. Francisco, the interpreter, was their spokesman, and I
            have no doubt ured them to make this demand. I 240 AT THE COCO-MARICOPA AND refused to
            accede to it, and told them that Francisco and one other would answer my purpose, as
            first pro- posed. At six o'clock this morning we set off, the party consisting of Dr.
            Webb, Messrs. Thurber, Pratt, Seaton, Force, Leroux, and myself, with attendants.
            Lieute-. nant Paige, with six soldiers, also accompanied us, that officer wishing to
            examine the opposite bank of the Gila, as well as the lands contiguous to the Salinas,
            with a view of establishing a military post in the vi- cinity of the Pimo villages.
            After crossing the bed of the Gila we pursued a westerly course about eight miles to the
            point of a range of mountains, near which we struck the bottom-lands. We now inclined
            more to the north, and in about eight miles struck the Sali- nas, about twelve miles
            from its mouth, where we stopped to let the animals rest and feed. The bottom, which we
            crossed diagonally, is from three to four miles wide. The river we found to be from
            eighty to one hundred and twenty feet wide, from two to three feet deep, and both rapid
            and clear. In these respects it is totally different from the Gila, which, for the two
            hundred miles we had traversed its banks, was slug- gish and muddy, a character which I
            think it assumes after passing the mountainous region and entering one with alluvial
            banks. The water is perfectly sweet, and neither brackish nor salt, as would be
            inferre(3 from the name. We saw from the banks many fish i its clear waters, and caught
            several of the same species as those taken in the Gila. The margin of the river on both
            sides, for a width of three hundred feet, consists of sand and gravel, brought down by
            freshets when i| i i PIMO VILLAGES. 241 the stream overflows its banks ; and from the
            appear- ance of the drift-wood lodged in the trees and bushes, it must at times be much
            swollen, and run with great rapidity. The second terrace or bottom-land, varies from one
            to four miles in width, and is exceedingly rich. As it is but little elevated above the
            river, it could be irrigated with ease. At present it is covered with shrubs and mezquit
            trees, while along the imme- diate margin of the stream large cotton-wood trees grow.
            Near by we saw the remains of several Indian wigwams, some of which seemed to have been
            but recently occupied. Francisco told us they were used by his people and the Pimos when
            they came here to fish. He also told us that two years before, when the cholera appeared
            among them, they abandoned their dwellings on the Gila and' came here to escape the
            pestilence. Owing to the intense heat, we lay by until five o clock, and again pursued
            our journey up the river nntil dark, when, finding a little patch of poor grass, we
            thought best to stop for the night. Supper was got, and a good meal made from our fish.
            As we brought no tents, we prepared our beds on the sand. We had not long been in when
            we saw a body of twelve or fifteen Indians on the river making for our camp. At first
            some alarm was felt, until Francisco told us that they* were Pimos. They proved to be a
            party which had been engaged in hunting and fishing. They were a jolly set of young men,
            dancing and sing- ing while they remained with us. I told them we .ould like a few fish
            for breakfast, if they would bring tHem in. With this encouragement, they took leaVe

            morning. But instead of waiting till the morning, they returned to the camp about
            midnight, aroused the whole party with their noise, and wished to strike a bargam at
            once for their fish, a pile of which, certainly enough to last a week, they had brought
            us. There was no getting rid of them without making a purchase, which I accordingly did,
            when they left, and permitted us to get a few hours' more sleep. Juhj Uh, 1852. Left
            camp at half-past four, a. m., determined not to wait for breakfast, but make the most
            of our time while it was cool ; for it would be impossible to travel, or rather be
            attended with great inconvenience, during the heat of the day. We con- tinued our course
            due east up the river, towards some singular piles of rocks with fantastic tops,
            appearmt, like works of .art. For some time we all imagined these rocks to be the ruined
            buildings of which we. were in search — the '' houses of Montezuma," as our Indian
            friends called them. We passed over the edge of a mountain, at the base of which the
            river ran, and then came to a wide and open plain, stretching some twenty -five or
            thirty miles eastwardly and southwardly- Entering this, we attempted to cross the
            bottom, which was so thickly overgrown with weeds and bushes that we could not penetrate
            it. We tried m vain to get through, but finding ourselves scattered, and fearing we
            should lose sight of each other, ffe retraced our steps along the margin of the hill, un
            i we passed the jungle. The bottom now became more open, and five or six miles further
            brought us to plateau. On our way we saw many traces of ancien 4 4 PIMO TILLAGES. 243 m
            * irrigating , canals, which were the first evidences that the country had been settled
            and cultivated. But on reaching the plateau we found remains of buildings, all, however,
            in shapeless heaps. Not an erect wall could be seen. A little mound, conical or oblong,
            designated the character of the building. In many places I traced long lines of fallen
            walls, and in others depressions, from which the soil had been removed to make the
            adobe. On the plain, in every direction, we found an immense quantity of broken pottery,
            ■ metate stones for grinding corn, and an occasional stone axe or hoe. The ground was
            strewn with broken pottery for miles. It was generally painted in a variety of geometric
            * figures. The predominant colors were red, black, and white. The quality of the ware
            was very fine, more so than that made by the Pimos. I noticed too that much of it was
            painted on the inside, while at the present time all the pottery of the Indians and
            Mexicans is painted on the outside. As it was now growing very warm, we left the plateau
            and struck off for the Salinas, encamping beneath some tall cotton-woods, where we
            prepared and partook of a late breakfast. Mr. Leroux, who had before come down the Sali-
            nas, pointed out to me a mountain some six or eight miles off, at the base of which the
            river San Francisco or Verde enters from the north. Since we struck the Salinas, its
            course had been mostly east and west ; and as far as it could be traced by the
            cotton-woods and verdure which mark its course, its direction indi- cated the same. We
            supposed ourselves now to be from thirty-five to forty miles from its mouth. Look- 244
            AT THE COCO-ilARICOPA AND o from where we were, the whole prospect shut in by mountains
            rising one above the other. I was informed by Leroux, that such was the character of the
            country all the way to New Mexico ; and that there were no more broad desert plains or
            luxuriant valleys like those of the Salinas and Gila rivers for the entire distance. He
            came here from Albuquerque, on tlie Eio Grande, by tlie valley of the Rio Verde, in
            fourteen days. We found the river clear and rapid, as at the first camp, with many
            trout, whose silvery sides glittered iu the translucent stream. ■ The quantity of water
            passing down the Salinas is more than double that of the Gila, which only becomes a
            respectable river after it receives the waters of the former. Yet there are seasons
            Avhen the whole is evaporated, or absorbed by the sandy bed through which it passes,
            before reach- ing the Colorado. When at Hermosillo, in Sonora, I met an American who had
            passed over the same route, and he found the bed dry in many places. At five in the
            afternoon, the heat being less, I crept from beneath my shelter of willows, where 1 had
            spent several hours, and, accompanied by Dr. Webb, mounted my mule, and left for the
            plateau in advance of the party. A ride of a mile brought us to the table- land, when we
            made for a large mound or heap which arose from the plain. In crossing the bottom we
            passed' many irrigating canals 5 and along the base of the plateau was one from twenty
            to twenty-five feet wide, and from four to five feet deep, form-ed by cut- ting down the
            bank — a very easy mode of construc- tion, and which produced a canal much more substan-

            miles. The whole of this broad valley- appeared to have been cultivated, though now
            over- grown with mezquit shrubbery. On reaching the great pile, I found it to be the
            remains of an adobe edifice from two hundred to two hundred and twenty-five feet in
            length, by from sixty to eighty feet wide, its sides facing the cardinal points.
            Portions of the wall were visible only in two places, one near the summit, at the south
            end, where, from the height of the pile, it must have originally been three or four
            stories high ; and the other at the north- ern extremity, on the western side. These
            remains just projected above the mass of rubbish and crum- bled walls. The rest formed
            rounded heaps of various heights and dimensions, worn into deep gullies by the rain ;
            the whole presenting a striking resemblance to the mounds which matk the site of ancient
            Babylon. The higher walls seen in . the sketch, , probably belonged to an inner portion
            of the building. Near this is a conical hill, formed, doubtless, by the crum- bling away
            of the higher portion or tower. Near the wall, which projects from the lower portion, at
            the northern end, are some large masses of this wall which have fallen. The adobe is
            still very hard, so much so that I could not break it vrith the heel of my boot. Several
            broken metates, or corn-grinders, lie about the pile. I picked up a stone pestle and
            some small sea shells. Along the eastern side are the remains of a long wall, extending
            beyond the build- mg, now but a rounded heap, which seemed to have formed an inclosure.
            On the western side is an exca- 246 AT THE COCO-MARICOPA AND vation about four feet
            deep, and extending from sixty to eighty feet from the main heap, and along its entire
            length ; from which I suppose the mud and gravel to have been taken to make the adobe.
            To the north- east, at a distance of two or three hundred feet, are the ruins of a
            circular inclosure. This was not large enough for a corral ; nor could it have been a

            may be seen in all directions similar heaps ; and about a mile to the east, I noticed a
            long range of them running north and south, which the Indians said were of a similar
            character to that on which we stood. In every direction, the plain was strewn with
            broken pottery, of which I gathered up some specimens to show the quality, as well as
            the style, of ornamenta- tion. I also found several of the green stones resem- bling
            amethysts which the Indians, after heavy rains, come here in search of. They are highly
            prized by them. All the early travellers in this country, from Coronado, who crossed the
            Gila in 1540, to the present time, have spoken of these so called amethysts. I would
            have liked to make a further examination of this plain ; but our animals had no grass or
            other feed, nor should we find any until we could reach the Gila, twenty-five miles
            distant, which prevented me from extending my examinations. Mr. Leroux informed me that
            on the banks of the an Francisco, are similar heaps to these, and other ruins, the walls
            still standing. He thinks that the buildings he has seen on that river, and others in
            the Moqui and Navajo country, of three and four stories m height, would, if in a ruined
            state, make similar heaps to those under our notice. I am inclined to the same opinion,
            and believe that the ruins we visited, belonged to a building of several stories. There
            is no doubt that this valley, as well as that of the Verde and Gila Rivers, were once
            filled with a dense population, far enough advanced in civilization to build houses of
            several stories in height, surrounded With regular outworks, and to irrigate their lands

            fate. I made fre- quent inquiries of the Pimos and Coco-Maricopas as to the builders of
            these and the ruins on the Gila, hut could obtain no other than the ever-ready, sahe ?
            These, as well as the ruins above the Pimo villages are known among the Indians as the "
            houses of Montezuma," an idea doubtless derived from the Mexi- cans, rather than from
            any tradition of their own. We asked our Indian guide, who Montezuma was. He answered, "
            Nobody knows who the devil he was ; all we know is, that he built these houses." After
            spending an hour here, we took a strongly marked trail, which looked as though it had
            been travelled for a century, and which led due south towards the Pimo villages. There
            were other trails, leading in various directions ; showing that the plain is much
            traversed, and the ruins often visited. vVe journeyed rapidly over the plain, which was
            a portion of the great plateau or desert. It was a perfect level without an undulation.
            Not a hill or a ravine inter- cepted our path. The vegetation was the same as found on
            the plateau in our journey up the south side of the Gila. Larrea and small mezquit
            bushes predom- inated ; while now and then the graceful petahaya raised its tall head
            far above the dwarfish plants of the desert, often startling us with its sudden
            appearance. It was near midnisrht when we entered a thick grove of mezquit, from whose
            branches were pendent quantities of the beans of which the mules are so As \v-e had now

            daylight should again appear. July 5th. At half-past four, without waiting breakfast

            other, until it reached their villages " Apaches ! Apaches ! " was the cry from every

            their allies the Maricopas. The two Indian guides who were with us, discovered the
            stampede we had so unin- tentionally caused among their Pimo brethren, and seemed to
            enjoy the joke much. In a few minutes we saw the Pimos mounted, bounding towards us in
            every direction, armed and ready for the contest ; others, on foot with their bows and
            arrows, came streaminf? after them : and a sh time, the foremost h who was doubtless

            they all burst into a hearty laugh, which was joined in by the rest as they came up.
            Assem- bling around our two Maricopas, they learnt the par- ticulars of our visit to the
            Salinas, They then all wheeled around; and while a portion acted as our escort to their
            villages, others fell behind and brought up the rear, so that our entry was that of a
            grand cavalcade. At 8 o'clock, we reached our place of encampment, having travelled
            fourteen miles. In the afternoon, Lieutenant Whipple and his party arrived. They had
            completed the survey of the Gila, a labor at this season of the year, with the heat at
            from 100 to 120 degrees Fahrenheit, attended with no small difficulty. June Qth. As the
            notes of this survey, and the accompanying astronomical observations, had been obtained
            with great labor and some suffering. I felt unwilling to expose them to the risk of
            being lost in a journey across the continent; and, accordingly, determined to remain
            here a few days longer, to give Lieutenant Whipple an opportunity to duplicate them with
            the view of sending them back by a messenger to Major Heintzelman, at Fort Yuma, to be
            forwarded by him to the Secretary of the Interior at Washing- ton. \ A brisk trade was

            to each of them I gave shirts, a few yards of cotton cloth, some Vermillion, beads,
            trinkets, etc. ; with all which they seemed greatly pleased. I told them that these
            things were in return for the friendship shown, and the assis- tance they had given to

            continue to aid them when in their power to do so. I added that they would then be
            considered as the true friends of the Americans, and would be rewarded accordingly ;
            furthermore, that the Ameri- cans might be induced to establish a garrison near them,
            which would protect them and prevent all future attacks from the Apaches. It was on this
            occasion, that I gave Francisco so many things, for which he seemed so ungrateful, I
            found too, that he had told his people to advance the price of their corn, and other
            things ; which made this day's bartering the end of our trade. I felt quite indif-
            ferent on the subject, as it was my intention to remove the camp to the villages of the
            Pimos; for Mr. Leroux had ascertained that they were much better supplied ith corn and
            every other commodity than the Cooo- -jfaricopas, and were very desirous that we should
            divide our time with them for the purpose of trading. A few Indians of a nearly extinct
            tribe called the Cawinas were in camp to-day. Only ten of this tribe 252 AT THE

            former dwelling-place was on the Gila towards the Colorado. There they were brouglit in
            contact with the Yumas ; and in the constant wars that existed between thera and the
            Cawinas, they were all exterminated, except the small number which had here. They speak
            a language different from the Pimos and Maricopas, and I could find one man among the
            latter who understood it. He promised to come and give me the vocabulary, but did not
            again make his appearance. July 8th. After breakfast this morning; we struck our tents,
            and bade farewell to our Maricopa friends, among whom we had been ten days, with many
            regrets. From the first day of our arrival, they had thronged our camp both day and
            night ; and I am not aware that they ever took an article that did not belong to them,
            nor had there been anv difficulty between us, except their trying to overreach us in
            trade. But this did not interrupt our friendship, or prevent me from treat- ing them all
            with kindness. In their intercourse with the whites, they are a docile and inoffensive
            people; but they exhibit the same cruelty as other Indiafis, towards those of their red
            brethren with whom they are at war. They still have occasional fights with the Yumas and
            the Apaches ; and should any prisoner fall into their hands, they would delight, as much
            as the Apaches do, in putting him to the torture. Last winter, while Dr. Webb and his
            party were here, they saw an example of this. It appears that when Captain Ximenes, with
            the Mexican Commission, was at the Colorado, they induced an intelligent Yuma z PBIO

            discovered him, and by stratagem, got possession of him; The party endeavored to effect
            his release ; but they had not force enough to compel his captors to surrender him, and
            no presents would induce them to do so. He was put to the torture; and Dr. Webb and the
            other gentlemen of the U. S. Commission, were, invited to join the Maricopas, in the
            festivities and dances on the occasion. Th Group of Pimo Indians. As we rode through the
            villages, we saw the peo- 254 AT THE COCO-MARICOrA AND VI pie engaged in their various
            occupations. The women were generally at work grinding their corn or wheat. The children
            were squatting or lying in the shade, doing nothing. The cradle was suspended by a cord
            to the roof and kept swinging by the husband, who lay stretched at length on his back,
            or by the children. In these communities, there are men who labor in the fields, while
            others lounge about the villages doing nothing. They seem to have their dandies and gen-
            tlemen of leisure, as well as their more civilized bre- thren. The women, too, were
            carrying water on their heads, or transporting other things in the sprawHng frames upon
            their backs. At noon, having journeyed about twelve miles through these villages and
            cultivated fields, we reached a spot near an acequia, where there was grass, and a
            pleasant grove of mezquit trees. Here we pitched our tents, intending to remain a few
            days. We had scarcely got our camp in order, when we were surrounded by the Pimos. I
            sent a messenger to inform their head chief Cola Azul (blue tail) who was at work in the
            fields, that I would be glad to see him. In a short time he appeared, accompanied by his
            inter- preter Tu-maams, Although it was a dreadfully ' day, when we felt like divesting
            ourselves of as much clothing as possible, Cola Azul appeared in a large blue blanket
            overcoat, pantaloons, and a green felt hat, while his attendants were either naked, or
            wore around their loins the white cotton blanket of their own manu- facture. He at once
            presented me a number of cre- dentials from various American officers, and others, who

            under Mr. Gray and Lieutenant Whipple, which had been operating here during the winter.
            I told him that, having completed the work, we were now on our return to the United
            States ; and that having heard of his kind treatment of the Americans who had passed
            through the villages of his people on their way to California, I wished to see all the
            chiefs of his tribe and present to them a few articles, as a token of the respect which

            chattering of strange voices around my tent ; on putting out my head, I found to my
            surprise, that, although it was but' 4 o'clock, the Pimo chiefs were already on the
            spot. This was a little too early for business, and besides, I was not prepared for the
            proposed conference. It would have been impolite to send them back ; so I requested them
            to wait until I ad taken my breakfast, which would be in about three V 256 AT THE

            gave them to stroll around the camp, and inspect the several culinary processes, from
            that of the Mexican arrieros with their queer dishes, to the of officers, where, if th

            towards them. That the surveying parties belonging to the Boundary Com- mission, had
            also spoken favorably of them. That I was not an Indian Agent, such as the United States
            often sent to make treaties with the tribes, and to dis- tribute presents ; but was in
            command of a party from the American government to trace the Boundary line which
            separated the United States from Mexico. That having been to California, and completed
            this duty, I was then on my return to the United States, and should 4 -I 9 1 few days

            made, such as their blankets, baskets, pottery, bows and arrows, etc., to show to the
            American people, that they might see what they could do ; and that, for these I would
            give them in exchange, blankets, cotton shirts, and other articles. Furthermore, I told
            them,, as an evidence of my good feelings towards them, and in consideration of the kind
            treatment they had extended to the Americans, I would present to each of them and to the
            interpreters, some shirts and cotton cloth. To these I added, for Cola Aznl, blankets,
            calico, beads, and trinkets for his wife and children. Before separat- ing, I requested
            them to exert themselves in endeav- ormg to obtain the liberation of the two American
            girls (Mr. Oatman's daughters) who had been carried into captivity by the Apaches, or

            much pleased with these trifling pre- sents, reiterated their expressions of friendly
            feelings towards the Americans, and said they would do all in their power to recover the
            two girls. They believed the Tonto Apaches to have been the murderers of their parents.
            I told them of the intention of the government to establish a military post near tliera
            on r the Gila, which would protect them from further attacks of the Apaches. This
            pleased them much. ' After the conference was ended, trading com- menced with much
            briskness. The same articles were bought of them as from the Maricopas, and we were .
            enabled, without difficulty, to obtain all the corn that was necessary for the mules of
            the whole train. One of their baskets we agreed upon with them for a measure, a certain
            number of which was the value of a yard of white cotton or a particular kind of shirt
            This was c|uite satisfactory to them ; and a much larger quantity of corn was brought in
            than we were able to take. When we had nearly completed our purchases, Francisco, the
            Maricopa chief and interpreter, came in and again interfered ; but the Pimos did not
            regard him, and manifested much pleasure when I ordered him out of the camp. They did
            not like his officious- ness, and said he always thrust himself forward when- ever a
            party of Americans or Mexicans came along, and managed to get whatever they had to give

            for twelve miles, turned short off to the north, and en- camped for the last time on the
            banks of the Gila. The river was here much contracted, with steep banks fif- teen feet
            high, and completely overhung with willows and cotton-woods, the latter from the
            opposite banks, meeting at the top. Its width was less than fifty feet, and its greatest
            depth did not exceed nine inches. It moved sluggishly along, was well and uncomfortably

            to-day, as we were between six £nd eight miles' above their most easterly village. Those
            who ventured to follow us, said that it was un- safe to go so far from home unless in
            large numbers, as bands of the Apaches were constantly hanging about near their
            villages, watching every opportunity to send an arrow through them, or rob them of their
            animals. It was so exceedingly hot to-day, that after reaching camp, we lay under the

            Excessive heat. r Having now left these peaceable semi-civilized Indians, 0'' a few
            general remarks respecting litem seem to be "' required. Some writers have endeavored to
            point out physi- cal differences between the Pimos and their allies the Coco-Maricopas ;
            but I must confess, that after being w constantly with, them for thirteen days, I was
            unable to distinguish one from the other, except bj some slight difference in the method
            of wearing their hair. Their modes of life, as before remarked, are the same, with the
            exception of their funeral rites. In the valley, or rather bottom-land, which they
            occupy, there is no 262 INDIANS OP THE GILA. dividing line between them ; nor is there
            any distin- guisliihg character in tlieir villages. I consider that the arts of spinning
            and weaving, and of making pottery, now practised by both tribes, and in which they are
            equally expert, originated with the Pimos, 'who inher- ited this knowledge from their
            ancestors; and that from the earliest period, doubtless for centuries, they have
            occupied portions of the same valley where w-e now find them. In leaving their villages,
            I noticed on the edge of the plateau traces of former habitations, which had been
            abandoned for a great length of time. The Coco-Maricopas took up their abode in the
            valley immediately adjoining the Pimos about thirty years since, from a point lower down
            the Gila, where they were exposed to the constant attacks of the Ynmas and Apaches,
            Avhich tribes, in consequence of their greater numbers, had nearly annihilated them.
            They came hither for protection, and formed an alliance, offensive and defensive, with
            the Pimos. They found the latter possessing the arts of weaving, of. building more
            comfortable dwellings, of making better pottery, enjoying a more peaceful mode of life,
            than that to which they had been accustomed. These arts and habits the Maricopas
            gradually adopted. Their lan- guages are totally different, so much so that I was
            enabled to distinguish them when spoken. The former is soft and melodious, the latter
            harsh and guttural. The Pimos bury their dead, while the Coco- Maricopas burn theirs.
            These peculiarities stamp them ns distinct nations. . I have not cited the agriculture
            of these tribes as superior to that of all other Indians ; although I may AND THE CASAS
            GRANDES 263 be safe in saying, that the system is more extensively and methodically
            practised than elsewhere. The Yu- mas, and other tribes on the Colorado irrigate their
            lands, and raise wheat, corn, melons, etc. The Moquis and the Navajos, far to the north,
            do the same ; and the warlike Apaches, who . are more nomadic in their habits than any
            tribe west of the Rocky Mountains, raise corn when driven to extremities. But the Pimos
            and Coco-Maricopas have made agriculture more of a system. Their lands are better
            irrigated, their crops are larger, and the flour wdiich they make from their wheat and
            maize is .quite as good as the Mexicans make, except in their grist-mills. I am inclined
            to think that Major Emory in his Report has greatly over-estimated the number of these
            people. ' He states, that "the population of the Pimos and Coco-Maricopas together is
            estimated variously at from three to ten thousand, and that " the first is evi- dently
            too low."' From information obtained from the chiefs, and the Mexican officers in
            Sonora, I should not place them above two thousand. Captain John- ston,! another officer
            attached to the army under General Kearney's command, in estimating them as embracing "
            over two thousand souls," came very near the mark Of the number stated by me, I was told
            that tv/o thirds were Pimos. Their complexion is a dark brown, differing from that of
            the red-skins east of the Rocky Mountains, and from the olive cast of the California
            tribes. The women have good figures, with full chests and finely * Enaorj's Report, p.

            measure, to the buraens tbey carry on their heads. The men have small and slender limbs,
            and, in their physical development, are quite inferior to the tribes between the
            Mississippi and the Rocky Momitains. This is readily accounted for by their different
            modes' of life. The Pimos exhi- bit a great simplicity of character, more so, I think,
            than the Maricopas, preferring to lead the quiet hves of agriculturists to the roving
            and predatory habits of the Apaches, Comanches, Navajos, and others. But although they
            do not like wars, they are by no means cowards, and do not hesitate to march against
            their enemies, the Apaches, when it becomes necessary. There are no tribes of Indians on
            the .continent of North America more deserving of the attention of philanthropists than
            those of which I am speaking. None have ever been found further advanced in the arts and
            habits of civilized life. None exhibit a more peaceful disposition, or greater
            simplicity of character ; and certainly none excel them in virtue and honesty. They are
            quite as industrious as their necessities require them to be. Possessing no market for
            the sale of their produce, they raise but little more than is necessary to supply their
            own wants. To do this, with a soil of great fertility, and water at their command,
            requires but little labor. Hence, after their crops are in, they have nothing to do
            until the season arrives to gather, them. Their granaries are then filled -with wheat,
            corn, beans, pumpkins, squashes, mezquit beans (their substitute for sugar), and the
            fruit of the peta- haya ; and after that, they undergo another long season of
            inactivity. Our Missionary Societies and Boards, ot AND THE CASAS GRANDES .265 Education

            shall hereafter speak), he says : river, distant one league " On the margin of the from
            the Casa Grande, we found a town in which we counted one hundred and thirty souls."* The
            author continues : "Having traversed four leagues, we arrived at the town of Tusoniraou,
            which is so named from a reat heap of horns, from the wild or sylvan sheep, which
            appears like a hill ; and from the number that I am inaebted for this extract to Mr.

            what can be seen of the highest of these houses, there appears to b'e a country of more
            than a hundred thousand hastas in extent. ■'' u The heathen Indians received us with
            jubilee, giving of their provisions to the soldiers; and we counted two hundred persons,
            who were gentle and affable. Remaining there to sleep, the Father and I instructed them,
            through the interpreters, in the mys- teries of our Holy Faith; on which' they besought
            us that there might be baptized fifteen of their children and seven sick adults." Four
            leagues from the Casa Grande would bring us about to the spot where we were then
            encamped, and near to the villages of the Pimos, which, in former times, extended much
            further up the Gila than they do at present. The great country which the writer saw here
            was doubtless the plain where the villages now stand, and the great plain to the north,
            extendin twenty-five or thirty miles to the Salinas. But Alegro,f in recounting the
            arduous labors oi Father Kino, relates other particulars of the Pimos and
            Coco-Maricopas, and the interviews between them and this zealous missionary. Kino found,
            in' 1698, the most friendly relations existing between them, and noticed the difference
            in their languages and dress. But their manners and customs were the same; and Cf \ « t

            thousand ; but whether or not this includes both tribes, is not clear. They then
            irrigated their lands as* now; and had large cultivated fields of wheat. The Coco-

            Font, a manuscript copy of which is in my possession : November 1st. 1775. We left the

            great joy at seeing us. They lodged us in a G shed of boughs, which they erected on pur

            tall and graceful petahaja occasionally thrusts forth its- thorny arms, like so many
            solitary columns or giant candela- bra. The bright walls of the ancient edifice
            presented a striking contrast with the deep green foliage of the trees which surrounded
            it. The " Casas Grandes," or Great Houses, consist of three buildings, all included
            within a space of one hun- dred and fifty yards. The principal and larger one is in the
            best state of preservation, its four exterior walls and most of the inner ones
            remaining. A considerable portion of the upper part of the walls has crumbled away and
            fallen inwards, as appears from the great quantity of rubbish and disintegrated adobe
            which fills the first story of the building. Three stories now stand and can plainly be
            made out by the ends of the beams remaining in the walls, or by the cavities which they
            occupied ; but I think there must have been another story above, in .order to account
            for the crumbling walls and rubbish within. The central portion or tower rising from the
            foundation, is some eight or ten feet higher than the outer walls, and may have been
            several feet, probably one story, higher when the building was complete. The Avails at
            the base are between four and five feet in thickness; their precise dimensions- could
            not be ascertained, so much having crumbled away. The inside is perpendicular, while the
            exterior face tapers towards the top,in a curved line. These walls, as well as the
            division walls of the interior, are. laid with large square blocks of mud, prepared for
            the pur- pose by pressing the material into large boxes about two !* I ■ AND THE CASAS

            hardened, the case was moved along and again filled, and so on until the whole edifice
            \vas completed. This is a rapid mode of building ; but the Mexicans seem never to have
            applied it to any pur- pose but the erection of fences or division-walls. The material
            of this building is the mud of the valley, mix- ed with gravel. The mud is very
            adhesive, and when dried in the sun, is very durable. The outer surface of the wall
            appears to have been plastered roughly ; but the inside, as well as the surface of all
            the inner wallsj is hard finished. This is done with a composition of adobe, and is
            still as smooth as when first made, and has quite a polish. On one of the walls are rude
            figures, drawn with red lines, but no inscriptions. From the charred ends of the' beams
            which remain in the walls, it is evident that the building was destroyed by fire. Some
            of the lintels which remain over the doors are formed of several sticks of wood,
            stripped of their bark, but showing no signs of a sharp instrument. The beams which
            supported the floors, were from four tq five niches in diameter, placed about the same
            distance apart, and inserted deeply in the walls. Hieroglyphic ■ \ :Most of the

            air. The ground plan of the building shos that all the apart- ments were long and narrow
            without windows. The inner rooms, I think, were used as store-rooms for corn ;• in fact,
            it is a question whether the whole may not have been built for a similar purpose. There
            are four entrances, one in the centre of each side. The door on the western side is but
            two feet wide, and seven or eight high; the others three feet wide and five in height,
            tapering towards the top, — a peculiarity belonging to the ancient edifices of Central
            America and Yucatan. With the exception of these doors, there are no exterior openings,
            except on the western side, where they are of a circular form. Over the doorway
            corresponding to the third story, on the western front, is an openm where there was a
            window, which I think was squar In a line with this are two circular openings. The
            southern front has fallen in in several place and is much injured by large fissures,
            yearly becomii larger, so that the whole of it must fall ere long. The other three
            fronts are quite perfect. The walls at the base, and particularly at the corners, have
            crumbled away to the extent of twelve or fifteen inches, and are only held together by
            their great thickness. The moist- ure here causes disintegration to take place more
            rapidly than in any other part of the building ; and in a few yeai-s, when the wmIIs
            have become more undermined, the whole structure must fall, and become a mere rounded

            AND THE CAS AS GR ANDES. 277 interesting patterns are represented in tlie accompany- ing
            engraving. The origin of these buildings is shrouded in mys- tery. They were found much
            as they now appear by the earliest explorers of the country, who were told by the
            Indians that they had been built five hundred years before. One thing- is evident, that
            at some former period the valley of the Gila, from this ruin to the western extremity of
            the rich bottom-lands now occu- pied by the Pimos and Coco-Maricopas, as well as the
            broad valley of the Salinas, for upwards of forty miles, Avas densely populated. The
            ruined buildings, the irrigating canals, and the vast quantities of pottery of a
            superior quality, show that, while they were an agri- cultural people, they were much in
            advance of the present semi-civilized tribes of the Gila. But this civi- lization
            extended far beyond the district named. From information given me by Leroux, it appears
            that rums of the same sort exist on the San Franci§co or Verde River ; and Captain
            Johnston and Major Emory both saw similar evidences of wide-spread population far above
            the district in question. What connection this ancient people had with the Moquis and
            Zuiiis, and with the "seven cities of Cibola," visited by Marco do Niza and Coronado,
            remains to be settled. This is strictly an ethnological question, requiring evidences
            and arguments which do not properly belong to this work. So with regard to the
            identification of particu- lar tribes yet in existence as the descendants of this
            ancient race, philology renders us the most reliable aid. But I have omitted speaking of
            philological ana- gies, as they belong to another topic and would 1 278 INDIANS OF THE
            GILA, occupy too mucli space to be introduced here. Little has yet been done for the
            ethnology of the Indian tribes west of the Rocky Mountains, except by Mr. Hale, in his
            elaborate and admirable " Ethnology and Philology of the United States Exploring
            Expedition." But I have reason to believe, that when the various lan- guages of Mexico,
            California, and of the tribes between the Colorado and New Mexico, are subjected to a
            rigid examination and comparison, some interesting facts will be deduced. The most
            detailed of the early accounts of the ruins on the Gila is that of Father Pedro Font, to
            whose interesting and reliable journal I have before alluded. As these ruins have been
            misunderstood by many and an important error propagated respecting them, I will give an
            extract from the diary of this missionary from the manuscript copy obtained by me in
            Califor- ) ma " The Commandant determined that we should rest to-day, and thus we had an
            opportunity to ex- amine the large building called Montezuma's House, situated at the

            accord ing to the histories and meagre accounts of it which w( have from the Indians,
            may have been built some five hundred years ago: for, as it appears, this buildii was
            erected by the Mexicans, when, during their transmigration, the Devil led them through
            various countries until they amved at the promised land of Mexico ; and in their
            sojourns, which were long ones, they formed towns and built edifices. The site on which
            this house is built is level on all sides, and at the dis- tance of about one league
            from the river Gila, and the ruins of the houses which composed this town extend more
            than a league towards the east and other cardi- nal points ; and all this land is
            partially covered with pieces of pots, jars, plates, etc. ; some common, and others
            painted of different colors, white, blue, red, etc. ; which is a sign that this has been
            a large town, inhabited by a distinct people from the Pimos of the river Gila, who do
            not know how to manufacture such earthenware. We made an exact survey of this edi- fice,
            and of its situation, which we measured in the mean time with a lance ; and this measure
            I after- wards reduced to geometrical feet, which gave a little more or less than the
            following result : " The house forms an oblong square, facing exactly to the four
            cardinal points, east, west, north, and south ; and round about it there are ruins,
            indicating a fence or wall, which surrounded the house and other buildings, particularly
            in the corners, where it appears there has been some edifice like an interior castle or
            Watch-tower; for in the angle which faces towards the south-west there stands a ruin,
            with its divisions and an 9 280 INDIANS OF THE GILA, 4 upper story. The exterior wall
            extends from north to south four hundred and twenty feet, and from east to west two
            hundred and sixty feet. The interior of the house consists of five halls ; the three
            middle ones J being of one size, and the two extreme ones longer. The three middle ones
            are twenty-six feet in length from north to south, and ten feet in breadth from east ■
            to west. The two extreme ones measure twelve feet from north to south, and thirty-eight
            feet from east to west."* • The Casa Grande, as described in this extract from Father
            Font, has been alluded to by many authors, and the dimensions, as given by him, quoted;
            but all have mistaken the meaning of the "vtriter in the dimen- sions. He speaks of the
            house around which "there are ruins, indicating a fence or wall which surrounded the
            house and other buildings ; " and then goes on to say, that "the exterior ivall extends
            from north to south four hundred and twenty feet, and from east to west two hundred and
            sixty feet." Nearly all the writers who refer to the building (and there are man}' among
            which may be named Baron Humboldt him 5 self*), quote these dimensions of the "fence" or
            ex- terior wall," as those of the edifice itself It is possi- ble that the manuscript
            referred to by Baron Hum- boldt differed from that in my possession ; for the extract
            from Font's journal, contained in Mr. School- craft's work on the Indian tribes, says :

            the environs are to be seen many other ruins and heaps of broken earth, which
            circumscribe it two leagues, with much broken earthenware of plates and pots of fine
            clay, painted of many colors, and which resemble the jars of Guadalajara, in Spain. It
            may be inferred that the population or city of this l3ody politic was very large ; and
            that it was of one government is shown by a main canal, which comes from the river by

            irrigate the plantations in the adjacencies." By the foregoing extracts it will be seen
            that these linildings were in much the same condition as that in which we now see them,
            although a century and a half has elapsed since Mangi's visit. He was told of other
            ruins " a day's jonrney to the north on another .stream " flowing into the Gila, which

            AND THE CASAS GRANDES. 283 I have been unable to learn from what source the prevailing
            idea has arisen of the migration of the Aztecs, or ancient Mexicans, from the north into
            the valley of Mexico, and of the three halts they made in their journey thither. This
            is" another idea which has been so widely promulgated that it has settled down into an
            acknowledged fact, although I confess I have seen no satisfactory evidence of its truth.
            People have got too much in the way of ascribing all ancient remains to the Aztecs. We
            hear of them on the shores of Lake Michio-an. where some have located the remains are
            spoken of of the Great Salt Lake, famous city of Aztlan. Other in the Navaji where the A

            our return to Our Indian companions, having got out of camp water (of which we had none
            to spare), set off in advance to reach the river, and there wait for us. They were quite
            reluctant to go alone even a couple of miles, for fear of the Apaches ; and I doubt
            whether they would have ventured even then without us, had they not been driven to do so
            by extreme thirst. As our canteens were all exhausted before leaving, we were obliged to
            follow their example. We found the river's bank about fifteen feet high, and so abrupt
            that it was with some difficulty we reached the water. After following the route by
            which we came, and crossing on our way several of the old irrigating canals, from which
            the ancient people who occupied the valley derived their water, we reached our camp at

            me, begging that I would give him a written recommendation to show to other Americans.
            His request was peremptorily refused. ' CASAS GRANDES TO SANTA CRUZ. 285 CHAPTER XXXIIL

            we struck the desert beyond the Colorado. During the week we were at Fort Yuma, as well
            as during our journey, there was but little variation. The nights remained comfortable
            all the timer so that open smgle blanket was necessary. Having a long march before us,
            we left camp at half- past 4 p. M., desiring to reach a mountain forty -five 286 CASAS
            GRANDES TO or miles distant, or half way across the great Jornada, the following
            morning, although we had little hope of find- ing water until we should get to Tucson.
            The mountain referred to is called the' " Picacho," a name applied to every high abrupt
            peak. Our course lay a little to the east of south, direct for the Picacho, across a
            vast open plain. A short range of mountains on the west, within a mile of the road, was
            soon passed. On the east was a lofty range fifty miles distant, with no intervening ob-
            jects. The road was excellent; and our animals being fresh, we hurried them on as fast
            as it was prudent to do. As we progressed, there seemed to be a likeli- hood of rain,
            which was somewhat increased by a per- ceptible change in the air. ;The prospect before
            us was dismal enough, in the midst of the wide-spreadii desert ; for by night-fall we
            had passed the mountams on our right, and were soon far from any landmark. As the sun
            sank below the horizon, the dark cloud- bank which we had observed far to the south
            ascended, and we could see the rain already falling on the dis- tant mountain. Night now
            set in ; the thick clouds rose higher and higher, and before nine o'clock had completely
            obscured every star. Shrouded as we were in darkness, it was no easy matter to find our
            way through the low mezquit bushes scattered over the desert. But nature's light-house
            opened its portals, and the vivid lightning flashed around us ; so that the black
            mountain, bur beacon in this desert, seemed constantly before us. Up to this time I had
            taken the lead in my wagon ; but as my mules became alarmed, rendering it impossible to
            get along,! placed Mr.LerouX, who rode a milk-white mule, immediately before mine. SANTA
            CRUZ. 287 His animal could be seen, and all followed hirn. Peals of the most terrific
            thunder burst upon us, leaving scarcely an interval of repose. Next came violent gusts
            of wind, accompanied bj clouds of sand and dust, reminding one of tlie African simoom.
            The wind was from the south, and brought the sand directly in our faces. To avoid it was
            impossible. Not a tree was to be seen ; no ravine appeared where we could shelter
            ourselves ; and the nearest mountain was yet twenty miles off. • Lastly came torrents of
            rain, and this ter- rific storm was at its heiht. • Slowly we journeyed on, drenched to
            the skin, not- withstanding our overcoats and India rubber gar- ments. The march before
            us must be made, and the sooner the " Picacho" was reached the better. To stop, was to
            endanger our animals ; for no pools had yet been seen where the rain had accumulated, so
            that we had neither water nor grass to give them. At mid- iiight, in the midst of this
            extreme darkness and rain, where one would about as soon expect to meet a human heing as
            in the middle of the broad ocean, we were suddenly brought to a stand by the sound of
            voices! Who comes there? Quien vive?" were quickly cried by a dozen voices in English
            and Spanish, and as quickly answered, "Friends! Amigos! Who are you ? Where are you from
            ? De donde viene ? " etc., and in a moment we were surrounded by horsemen, pack-mules,
            and the accompaniments of a large party. *ere they Indians, or Mexicans, or Americans —
            friends or enemies, ran through my mind, till the sound of English voices dissipated my
            apprehensions. It proved * be a party of between .forty and fifty Americans, (( ; i 288
            CAS AS GRANDES TO bound for California. We stopped about ten minutes to excbante a few
            words, tbougb we could not distin- guisb faces. This we were, in a measure, compelled to
            do, to separate our animals from those of the passing train, for all were now mixed up
            together. The party was from Missouri, and had come by the way of El Paso. They gave us
            some news from the latter place, which was very acceptable. Inquiries were made by each
            party about the grass and water on the route, when, the animals becoming restive, we
            bade them adieu, and resumed our journey. Up to this time, the tempest had not in the
            least abated. Indeed the darkness seemed growing still thicker, while the flashes of
            lishtninf were becoming less frequent, which rendered it more difficult to keep on our
            course. After a longer interval than usual, the heavens were again lighted up, when I
            found myself going in an opposite direction to the right one, and the party much
            scattered. Leroux came up, and said that it was absolutely necessary to stop where we
            were ; as some of the pack-mules were missing, and it was impossible to keep together or
            find our way in such impenetrable darkness. I accordingly had my mules taken out and
            hitched to my wagon ; the same was done with the teams. All the pack-mules that could be
            found, were brought together ; and the horsemen fast- ened their animals wherever they
            could find a bush. Dr. Webb and myself remained quietly .in our wagon. In the midst of
            the storm Mr. Thurbei-, with a great deal of perseverance, succeeded in making a fire.
            This was done by taking the leaves of some books that had seen their best days, and

            lighted. To these was added some dry wood found in the wagons ; and when bushes were
            piled upon the whole, a blazing fire was the result. This served as a guide to our
            scattered people, some of whom had found themselves among the emigrating party, with
            their faces turned towards the Gila ! June lAth. As soon as we could, see, the animals
            were mustered ; when three mules with their packs, two donkeys, and our three remaining
            beef-cattle, were missing. Two Mexican et,rrieros w'ere left to hunt up these animals,
            and the train resumed its journey. The road was now very muddy, and every depression in
            the desert became filled with water, making the travelling quite heavy. Soon after
            starting we met the rest of the party that we encountered in the night. They had become
            separated from those in advance, and had been com- pelled to await the return of day.
            Among them were several women on mules, who appeared to have had a sorry time of it.'
            The " Picacho" was still far ahead ; but after waterin o the animals, we pushed on, and
            at n n at 11 o'clock reached its base, where we encamp- ed*. I had been eighteen hours
            in my seat, and was glad to throw myself on the ground beneath the shade of a mezquit
            bush, and get some sleep. After an hour's rest I got up and made a fire for my cook, who
            was still deep in his slumbers ; and by one o'clock we had or breakfast. This forty-five
            miles was the most fatiguing day's journey we had yet had, including the exposure during

            food in the tufts of grass, and mez- quit beans. At 5 o'clock in the afternoon we
            started again, although we had had but little rest. I would have .remained till morning,
            but our water was nearly out. The road had by this time become quite dry, and we rolled
            on at a steady gait of three miles an hour. Soon after leaving, the sky became overcast,
            and we feared a repetition of the storm ; . but it did not occur, and, although we had
            considerable difficulty in keeping our course, we were enabled to continue our journey
            through the entire night. July 15tk At 5 o'clock this morning, being in ad- vance of the
            train, we reached some mud holes contain- ing a little water, which our thirsty animals
            drank with eagerness. During the night, many who were mount- ed on mules were so much
            fatigued as to be unable to retain their seats in their saddles ; so dismounting, and
            tying their animals to the bushes, or to their bodies, they lay down on the desert, and
            refreshed themselves With a couple of hours sleep. At seyen, the wagons ■ith the rest of
            the party came up; and, although but eight miles from Tucson, such was our fatigue after
            two long: nisrhts' ride, that we determined to t) 'et remain here to-day. Much to my
            regret, no tents "Were pitched ; for a heavy shower came up in the iglit, which wet most
            of the party to the skin. I was so fortunate as to make my bed beneath a wagon ; liere,
            protected by an India rubber blanket, I passed a comfortable night, and scarcely knew of
            the rain that "Was falling around me until morning. r 292 CASAS GRAXDES TO July IGtJk We
            started with a heavy road, and made but slow progress. The wagons got mired several
            times in crossing arroyos, one of them so deeply that it be- came necessary to unload it
            before it could be released ; while another, in passing a deep gully, plunged so
            suddenly down, that the tongue was snapped off. We reached Tucson at ten o'clock, A. m.
            As we passed the garrison, a body of Mexican soldiers were CD who had just arrived from
            the campaign against the Apaches. Among the officers standing at the gate I recognised
            Captain Barragan, who was in command at Santa Cruz when we reached that place in October
            last. Hearing from him that General Blanco was within, I left the train and accom-
            panied the Captain to pay my respects to him. General Blanco informed me that the
            depredations of the Apaches had lately been more frequent than ever. Many animals had
            been stolen in the immedi- ate vicinity of Tucson, Tubac, and Santa Cruz ; and many
            Mexicans had lost their lives. The troops had had some skirmishes with the Indians, in
            which Coletto Amarillo, one of the chiefs who so frequently visited us at the Copper
            Mines, was killed. The General fur- thermore told me that when on his march he fell upon
            a large Indian trail, and noticed among the footprmts several made by new American
            shoes, which he readily distinguished from the Mexican shoes by their larger size and
            heels. He believed that there were Ameri- cans among them, or that they had murdered and
            robbed some party of emigrants. In October, when the weather should be cooler, and the
            rainy season past, it was his intention to make a campaign against Tt*- o h - SANTA
            CRUZ. 293 tlie Apaches on the Gila, and thence go to the Mogo- J lion Mountains, near

            town, and there found my party encamped on the hanks of the Santa Cruz River, where
            there -was an abundance of grass. Near our camp we found Mr. Coons, an Am his way to San
            Francisco, with 14,000 sheep For the protection of this large flock, he had sixty
            persons, forty-five of whom were Americans, and fifteen Mexi- cans. He quieted iety

            entirely unprepared for the attack, particularly as the rascals approached him from the

            no means well prepared for the visit; for tlie wagon which contained my tent and
            baggage, being the one which had met with the acci- dent before mentioned, had not yet
            reached camp : I was therefore obliged to receive him in another and very small tent,
            not large enough for one half the officers who accompanied him. It began to rain too at
            the time, which added to my dilemma. However, there were other tents pitched, in which
            these gentle- mea took refuge. General Blanco again spoke of our common enemy, the
            Apaches, and of operations against them. He recommended that the American troops should
            attack them north of the Gila, while the Mexi- cans should receive them as they came
            south for refuge. I told him that my views agreed with those he had expressed, and that
            I had suggested a simi- lar plan of operation to the United States government r in a
            recent dispatch sent from California. * The General tendered me the use of his black-
            smith's shop, and any other facilities I required to repair my broken wagons ; of which
            I was very gld to avail myself, although we found it difficult to obtain a piece of wood
            for a new tongue. My little wagon also wanted repairs, and some of the animals required
            shoeing. There was, therefore, no alternative but to remain here a day or two. I would-
            have regretted this delay more, had, not the grass been so I believed the mules would be
            benefited by it. In the evening the rain set in hard, and continued during the night.

            it flows south to that place. It then takes a westerly direction for about ten miles,
            after which it flows northward through -Tubac and Tucson, and soon be- comes lost in the
            desert. The lands- near Tucson are very rich, and were once extensively cultivated ; but
            the encroachments of the Apaches compelled the peo- ple to abandon their ranches and
            seek safety within the town. The' miserable population, confined to such narrow limits,
            barely gains a subsistence, and could not exist a year but for the protection from the
            troops. More than once the town has been invested by from one to two thousand Indians,
            and attempts niade to take it, but thus far without success. These Apaches have become
            reduced quite as much as the Mexicans ; so that two hundred warriors are about the
            largest force they can now collect. In addition to the river alluded to, there are some
            296 CAS AS GR ANDES TO springs near the base of a hill a mile to the west of the town,
            which furnish a copious supply of water. Near these is a hamlet, and a large hacienda,
            which in former times must have been very rich. It is now in a decayed state, and but a
            small portion of its fine lands are cultivated. This hacienda is seen in the fore-
            ground of the annexed sketch of Tucson. ■ Wheat, maize, peas, beans, and lentils are
            raised in perfection ; while among the fruits may be named, apples, pears, peaches, and
            grapes. The only vege- tables we saw were onions, pumpkins, and beans; but in such a
            fertile valley all kinds will of course do well. The houses of Tucson are all of adobe,
            and the majority No be given to repair ; but as soon as a dwelling becomes
            uninhabitable, it is deserted, the miserable tenants creeping into some other hovel
            where they may eke out their existence. We found three hundred soldiers in the place,
            although the average number for some years past' has not exceeded twenty. The
            bottom-lands are here about a mile in width. Through them run irrigating canals in
            fevery direction, the lines of which are marked by rows of cotton- woods and willows,
            presenting an agreeable land- scape. I ascended a rocky hill above the hacienda men-
            tioned, about a quarter of a mile from our camp, and had a fine view of the valley and
            surrounding country. This hill was covered with cacti of every variety, among which the
            petahaya was most prominent, in® fouquiera, yucca, and agave, were also luxuriating 9

            was the valley, its fields and" acequias defined by the long lines of shrubbery and
            trees. The town is seen on the border of the plateau, where the desert begins, and
            stretches off to the east, to a high range of mountains about fifteen miles distant. In
            these mountains is a singular cliff of rocks resembling a huge castle. Like othej;
            mountain ranges, these take a south-easterly direction and extend nearly to the San

            the like of which cannot probably be found, even in this country of strange animals. The
            interior is gaudily painted ; and from the profusion'of gilding, one might suppose the
            Mis- sion to have possessed a gold placer. Around the altar, and in the niches, are many
            -wooden statues, from the size of a foot to that of life. The poor Indian doubtless
            believed them all to be saints, and made his oiferings accordingly, although about one
            half are statues of old Spanish cavaliers and figures of Chinese mandarins. There are
            besides angels and archangels, or figures intended to represent celestial beings with
            wmgs, five or 'six. feet high, springing from the walls. This church was built towards
            the close of the last cen- tury from the produce of the Mission lands, and is throughout
            in a good state of preservation. It appears that there was a previous structure here,
            erected by Father Kino as early as 1700.* hat a marked difference there is in Spanish
            and English colonization! Here the zealous Missionary preceded all others, planting the
            cross along with the banner of his country. Then commenced the work of baptizing ; and
            as soon as a sufficient number of con- certs had been made, a fertile valley was chosen,
            and a church erected with buildings to accommodate some hundreds. Next came the
            colonists, whose main efforts * Alegre, Hist, de la Corap. de Jesus en Iueva Espala.—
            Tom. iii p. 119. Tfl 300 '• CASAS GRAXDES TO were ,to support the Mission and its
            priests. The Anglo-Saxon pioneer entered the wilderness with his axe, his plough, and
            his rifle ; and after he had erected his own dwelling, the mill and blacksmith's shop
            rose up. Lands were brought into cultivation, the mecha- nic arts flourished; and when
            the colony became large enough and rich enough to support a pastor, a church was built
            For the results of the two modes of coloni- zation, compare Texas, New Mexico,
            California, So- nora, and Chihuahua, before the three first became annexed to the United
            States, and the States of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, and Michigan. The latter had attain-
            ed more wealth, more population and importance, and had done quite as much towards
            promoting Christianity in the first ten years after their settlement, as the former
            States had in two centuries. . Near by is a fertile valley, a very small portion of
            which is now tilled : although from appearances, it was all formerly irrigated and under
            cultivation. I tried in vain to purchase vegetables. A more thoroughly lazy set of
            people, I never saw. The Pimo and Coco- Maricopa Indians of the Gila, are infinitely
            superior to them. 'Whether a proximity to the church and the worthless half-civilized
            Mexicans has reduced them to this state of indolence and poverty, I know not ; but if
            so, they would better have remained in their native valleys, and never seen the faces of
            white men. Leaving the village, we rode on a mile further, and stopped in a fine grove
            of large mezquit trees near the river, where there was plenty of grass. We remained here
            until 3 o'clock, p. m., when we resumed our journey along- the valley as before,. SANTA

            hour before it began to rain in torrents, the wind blowing directly in our faces. Be-
            lieving the shower would soon pass over, I turned my wagon round and stopped. Those on
            horseback drew up under trees ; but there was little shelter from them, so violently did
            the rain pour down. After an hour's delay, we pushed on. The road was now exceedingly
            muddy, the ravines and gullies were filled with water, and our progress was very slow.
            After journeying eight miles, making seventeen in all since morniug, and being much in
            advance of the train, I deemed it prudent to stop. The wagons would not probably get in
            before night, after which, it would be unsafe to tra- vel, owing to the washing of the
            road by the rains ; for we had in many places to avoid it, and force our way through the
            woods. The clouds indicated more rain ; so I set to work and had a good fire in
            readiness for my cook when he should arrive. Those who were with me followed my '
            example, and we soon had several large fires blazing, and a good stock of wood in. As
            soon as the train got in, all hands set to work to pitch the tents, and take the
            necessary precautions to keep them in their places before the storm should be upon us.
            Guys were fixed to all the tents, which were further supported by being attached to the
            wagons ; for the ground was so soft that the pins would not hold. Trenches were dug
            around each one, to keep It dry as possible ; and we were quite ready for it, when the
            rain airain beran to fall. After a hearty C5""' "tD supper, we retired to rest ; but it

            of the tents was hurled from its fastenings and blown more than a hundred yards before
            it was arrested. July 20th. The rain having continued the whole night, we were much
            delayed in getting off this morn- ing. The whole country was drenched with water, and
            the road almost impassable for our heavily-loaded wagons. After a hard journey of
            eighteen miles, we stojped at the banks of the river; and strange as it may appear,
            notwithstanding all the rain that had fallen, the river, such is the uncertainty of the
            streams in this country, was quite dry. Fortunately, in some cavities in the river's bed
            we found water enough for t our present wants. Our march was a straggling one to-day, as
            some of the teams could not keep up. My baggage wagon in par- ticular, which also
            contained my tent and cooking utensils, did not get in until after d*ark. One of the
            mules broke down to-day, and was taken out of the team. Others showed signs of great
            exhaustion, from the heaviness of the road and the long march. July 2lst. It having
            rained most of the night, and every thing being wet, we were unable to leave before nine
            o'clock. After journeying over a muddy road for nine miles, we reached Tuhac another
            presidio or garrison, consisting of a collection of dilapidated build- ings and huts,
            about half of which were tenantless, and an equally ruinous church. Captain Gomez, who

            Craig in May, 1851, was in command here, and came out to meet us as we passed through
            the plaza. To our infinite astonishment and regret, we learned that Senorita Inez
            Gonzales, the Mexican girl whom we had liberated from captivity, and restored to her
            parents at Santa Cruz in September, was living at this place with the officer just
            named. Captain G. himself, although acquainted with all tlie circumstances of her *
            restoration, did not mention her name to me; but having been informed of the fact from
            others, I asked him if she was at his quarters. He replied that she was, but was quite
            ill, and furthermore that she was about to return with her mother to Santa Cruz. On
            telling him that I must see her, he invited me into his house, whither I was accompanied
            bj several gentle- men of the Commission. The poor girl seemed very glad to see us. She
            was not ill, but evidently felt under some restraint, as the Captain remained dur- ing
            the interview. She seemed very sad and un- .happy ; and when asked if she would
            accompany us back to the States, as we had before invited her, she knew not what to say,
            and, fearing to give offence to her new captor, looked to him for a reply. The interview
            was a very unsatisfactory one, and we were all quite reluctant to leave her in such a
            position ; hut Captain Gomez assured us she would return home with her mother, who was
            then in Tubac. The next iay we accordingly took, leave, expecting that the party she
            accompanied would overtake us. In a book of travels in a strange country, one is 304 .

            forsaken place, when I have said that it con- tains a few dilapidated .buildings, and an
            old church, with a miserable population, I have said about all It was established as a
            presidio almost a centurj and a half ago, and usually maintained a population of four
            hundred souls. It was abandoned a year before our arrival, but had since been
            repopulated, and might have comprised at the time of our visit a hundred souls. The
            bottom-lands near it, along the Santa Cruz River, are quite rich, and can be made to
            produce the same grain, fruit, and vegetables as at Tucson. At the rancho of Calabasa,
            in the same district, is a gold mine which was once productive, but the fear of the
            Apaches led to its abandonment. As an example of the uncertainty of crops from
            artificial irrigation in this country, I will mention a circumstance which occurred at
            Tubac. The preceding fall, after the place had been again occupied, a party of Mormons
            in passing through on their way to California was induced to stop there by the
            representations of theComandante. He offered them lands in the rich valley, where
            acequias were already dug, if they would remain and cultivate it ; assuring them that
            they would find* a ready market for all the corn, wheat, and vegetables they, could
            raise, from the troops and from passing emigrants. The offer was so good, and the
            prospects so flattering, that they consented to remain. They therefore set to work, and
            ploughed and sowed their lands, in which they expended all their means, anticipating an
            abundant harvest. , But the spring and summer came without SANTA CRUZ. 305 rain : the
            river 'dried up ; their fields could not be irrigated ; and their labor, time, and money
            were lost. They abandoned the place, and, although reduced to the greatest extremities,
            succeeded in reaching Santa Isabel, in California, where we fell in with them. We had
            got but a mile from Tubac, when one of the wagons broke down and became a total wreck.
            We were travelling on level ground at the time, and the accident was wholly unexpected.
            On examina- tion, it was found that the rim and spokes of one of the wheels had become
            loose, and giving way simul- taneously, the wheel was crushed. This let the axle- tree
            down with such force as to break oS the end. A new fore-wheel and axle-tree were now
            necessary, to- gether with some blacksmith's work, without which the wagon would be
            useless. I accordingly sent to Oaptain Gomez, to learn if he could render us any aid ;
            but to my regret he sent me word that there was not a mechanic in the town, nor tools of
            any description. As there was no prospect of moving further until some change was made
            in our transportation, and perhaps some articles left, I gave orders to pitch the tents
            and turn out the mules, there being plenty of grass and ood near, with the Santa Cruz
            Kiver, now full of ater, within a hundred yards of us. In the midst of our dilemma, and
            while we were pondering what to do, a train of some twelve or fifteen emigrant wagons
            hove in sight, and in a few minutes reached our camp. It was a pleasant event to meet a
            party from home once more ; although they .had no ews to tell us, as they had left their
            homes in Arkan- s m May, and had now been nearly three months on VOL. II. — 20 306 CASAS

            that we must behind us, and they de clined to take it at any price. We accordingly

            for tent-pms J and abandoned the remainder. July 22d. We did not get th , when we

            covered* with mezquit trees of a large size. The bottom-lands resembled meadows, being
            covered with luxuriant grass, and but few trees. The impiediate banks of the river,
            which is here as diminutive as near Tucson, are lined with cotton- wood trees of a
            gigantic size, resembling our largest elms. In some places there are large groves of
            these trees, rendering this part of the valley the" most pic- turesque and beautiful we
            had seen. At four o'clock, we reached one of these groves on the river's bank, where we
            encamped. A mile before reaching camp, we passed the rums of a large rancho known as
            Calabasa ; for every large rancho or hacienda has its name and place on the map. Even
            after the establishment has been aban- doned, and its walls have crumbled to the ground,
            the name remains. This custom is prevalent throughout northern Mexico. Along the valley
            of the Rio Grande and in New Mexico are a host of names on the map sPplied to ranchos,
            and sometimes to places where neither villaofes nor ranchos now exist. The same inay be
            said of Sonora and Chihuahua, and where there were no settlements locations were given.
            A stranger on looking at one of these maps would ima- gine the country thickly settled,
            whereas there might not be a village, rancho, or even a single inhabitant, tere he is
            treated to a long list of names, including If the saints in the calendar, all the
            apostles, and the Holy Lady of Guadalupe into the bargain. . is Calabasa, I was told by
            Leroux, was a thriv- Dg establishment when he visited it twenty years ago. 308 CASAS
            GRANDES TO A large tract of land was tlien under cultivation, and herds of cattle were
            reared on llie adjacent hills. But tlie stream did not furnish a sufficient quantity of
            water to irrigate it, without cutting off entirely the towns of Tubac and Tucson ; and
            consequently it was aban- doned. This is the difficulty with these small water- courses
            ; for having few or no tributaries to keep up the supply, as our northern streams have,
            and fre- quently running a course of several hundred miles before they terminate, their
            water cannot be drawn off without destroying the crops below them, and even depriving
            the people and animals of water to drink. I ascended one of the low hills here, about
            two hundred feet in height, which approached within one hundred and fifty yards of the
            river. This range crosses the stream, and runs far to the south on the western side.
            From these hills the plateau extends some ten or fiften miles on both sides, when it
            strikes the mountain ranges. On the east is the mountain called Santa Kita, the highest
            within a hundred miles : in fact it 'is higher than any we had passed since leav- ing
            the Gila; and on its opposite side, where I was in September last, there is none of so
            great an altitude for one hundred and fifty miles. From the point where I stood, I could
            see the mountain at the base of which my party was lost last year in trying to reach
            Santa Cruz, This place was directly east of us, about twelve or fifteen miles distant.
            During our journey to-day, some five or six miles back, I noticed the ruins of
            Tumacacori. Its beauti- ful and picturesque church showed finely among the thick grove
            of trees by which it is inclosed. The J SANTA CRUZ. ' 309 + "church is a mile from the
            road ; and supposing that we should pass it, I made no inquiries, but kept on, until I
            got too far to return. It seems that there was a path leading to it, which Mr. Pratt and
            some of the horsemen took, but which I did not observe. Mr. P. took a sketch of it.
            Tumacacori was formerly a mis- sion of note. It was connected with the presidio of
            Tubac, and had been lately abandoned in consequence of the incursions of the Apaches. ,
            Passed to-day two parties of emigrants on their way to California. They each had from
            twelve to fifteen wagons, all drawn by oxen, and were from the State of Arkansas.
            Numerous questions were asked, as on former occasions, about grass, water, and the
            Indians. We learnt from these people that there were many parties of emigrants behind,
            and that we should pro- bably fall in with them every day. The emigrants from Arkansas
            and Texas all take the southern route, % way of El Paso ; while those from the more
            northern States go by way of Independence and the Great Salt Lake. V A party of Mexican
            soldiers from Tucson overtook and passed us after we had encamped, carrying in a
            palanquiu their Colonel, who was ill with a fever. As there was no medical attendant at
            the place, they were taking him to Arispe. Soon after, a second party of soldiers
            stopped and encamped near us, probably for the sake of security against the Apaches ;
            for they feel perfectly safe when Jinder the wing of a party of well-armed Americans.
            This valley is a favorite ' haunt of these freebooters ; and although we saw none, there
            is no doubt but they / 310 CASAS GRANDES TO botli saw and followed us. Thej keep to tlie
            hills near by, where they can overlook the road, and are sure to pounce upon any small
            and unprotected party of tra- vellers ; for not a week passes without depredations and
            murders, " July 23d The valley to-day was more contracted, owing to the proximity of the
            hills, which in many cases reached the stream, compelling us to cross them. The country
            grew more picturesque and diversified, exhibiting alternate valleys and gentle hills. In
            thq former were groups of large walnut-trees, whose deep green foliage presented a
            striking contrast with the lighter and yellowish hue of the cotton-woods, and the
            brighter green of the willows. The intermediate spaces between the hills and the stream
            exhibited a luxuriant growth of grass. But it must be remem- bered that the enchanting
            aspect which every thing now wore in this valley does not continue. It was the rainy
            season, when vegetation presents its most attractive garb. In a few weeks the daily
            showers ■_ would cease, and the parching sun would dry up every thing but the cacti,
            which do not seem .to be bene- fited by rain, and the large trees of the valley, which
            find moisture enough in the earth to sustain them until the rainy season again comes
            round. The grass then withers and dies, and the stream furnishes barely water enough to
            supply the immediate wants of the people. Passed a party of emigrants with nine wagons,
            each drawn by ten oxen. The men were hardy and good-looking, being just such as are
            wanted in Califor- nia. This train, as well as the others we had met, SANTA CRUZ. 311
            had more oxen than were required to draw the wagons; but the owners were taking them to
            market as beef cattle, and found it much easier" to joke them to their wagons than to
            drive them loose. Some of these wagons drawn bj five yoke of cattle did not contain more
            than five hundred pounds weight, while the capacity of the team would suffice for five
            or six thousand pounds. At three o'clock, we encamped in a fine grove of trees near the
            river, having travelled twenty miles. A heavy rain set in just before we stopped,
            attended with thunder and lightning. July 2Uh. Got an early start this morning. The
            valley grew still more contracted; in fact for miles there cannot be said to be any
            valley, the stream sim- ply winding its way among the hills. Eight miles brought us to
            the old rancho of Scm Lazaro where we found an encampment of fifty or sixty emigrants
            jfrom Arkansas, bound for the land of gold. Before these people knew who we were, they
            ex- pressed much surprise at seeing a large and well-or- ganized party going eastward ;
            some exclaiming, when they saw we were Americans, "Holloa, strangers, haven't you
            mistaken the road — you're going the wrong way— this is the way to Californy!" Similar
            expressions were made by almost every party we met; ut when they found we had been to
            California, and could give them some information about it, there was »o end to their
            inquiries. All seemed to have their thoughts up6n gold ; for they invariably asked whe-
            ther the yield continued as great as at first, what we thought of its holding out, etc.,
            etc. I 312 CASAS GR ANDES TO Several of this party were sick, particularly women and
            children. On hearing this, I stopped to give Dr. Webb an opportunity to visit and
            prescribe for them. The Doctor had done the same for other parties which we found were
            unprovided with medicines, or any of the comforts required in their condition. The con-
            stant rains they had been exposed to, with no protec- tion but their wagons, had caused
            much sickness among them ; and it was pitiful to see these poor ema- ciated and
            suffering creatures lying beneath the trees, resting a day or two, until they could
            recover strength enough to proceed. In my former journey through Sonora, we stopped at,
            San Lazaro, a large deserted hacienda, with ex- tensive orchards and fertile grounds
            around it. Leav- ing this, we kept along up the stream, over a rough road, for nine
            miles, and reached Santa Cruz at eleven o'clock. Travelled distance to-day, seventeen
            miles. I sent the train and party a mile beyond the vil- lage, to encamp where there was
            plenty of grass, and where the men would be away from the contaminations of a low
            Mexican population, miserable filthy, and poor as this was. I called on our old friend,
            Padre Bernardino Pa- checo, and took breakfast with him. He had much to relate to us
            that had transpired since our last visit. The Apaches, he told us, had made several
            attacks on the people within half a mile of the town, and had carried off many of their
            mules and cattle, and mur- dered five of the inhabitants. The last attack was made two
            weeks before our arrival, when they were pursued by a party of soldiers, in which a
            Polish officer _Ki 1 L ■ Lf 1 ■ 'I .4 SANTA CRUZ, 31a i in the Mexican service was shot
            by a rifle ball in his arm from which wound he was then suffering severe- We also
            learned that the three men who joined us at Santa Isabel, California, and who left us on
            the desert at the time Colonel Craig was killed, had reached here about the time of the
            affray with the Indians. They took part in it, and one of them re- ceived a wound. After
            a couple of hours spent in the town, I rode forward to our camp, where the tents and
            wagons had been arranged in a square, for the better protection of the men and animals
            in case of an attack from the Indians, who, we were told, were constantly prowling about
            the neighborhood, and watching an opportunity to surprise any party whom they thought
            unprepared, or to run off any animals not sufficiently guarded. i' ■ 314: SANTA CRUZ TO

            Yuma, we had had no opportunity to complete the repairs on the wagons, some of which
            were much injured and had been temporarily patched up with raw hide or other- wise.
            Besides the iron work to be done on these, many of the mules required shoeing. It was
            necessary, therefore, that this work should be done here, as we should have no other
            opportunity until we reached the frontier towns of Janos or Carrelitos in the State of
            Chihuahua, still nearly two hundred and fifty miles distant. The Guadalupe Pass, which
            we had twice been through, and with whose difficulties we were well acquainted, was yet
            before us, besides some very rocky mountain ridges. I therefore deemed it advisa- ii- .
            1 THE PRESIDIO OF JAKOS. " 315 ble to shoe the fore feet of all the team mules, leaving
            the pack and riding mules, with few exceptions, to go as they were. It would have been
            well to shoe them all ; but the difficulties in the way of getting any thing done
            compelled me to dispense with such work as was not absolutely necessary. There was a
            blacksmith's shop in the village, a bellows, and an anvil, but very indifferent tools.
            Then there was no charcoal, and no shoes or nails. The first step, therefore, was to
            send three or four men witH pack -mules to the mountains for wood, and several others to
            guard them, and prevent a surprise by the Apaches, This obtained, we had to burn it into
            char- coal ; and then three of our most ingenious men were dispatched to the
            blacksmith's shop, to assist in forg- ing the shoes and nails, and in shoeing the
            animals. I took my turn last night, for the second time, in that most disagreeable of
            all our duties, standing guard. The arrangements which we made before starting from the
            Pimo villages, where our escort left us, were, that two of the men should stand guard
            for two hours, commencing at 8 o'clock, and that this guard should be relieved every two
            hours until the camp was called in the morning, and the mules turned out to feed. But I
            was unwilling to trust to all the tiiligeuce would not be observed. The officers there-
            fore agreed, without exception, to take their turn; one to stand every night till 12
            o'clock, and another ft'om that hour till the morning. This was an arduous uty ; but our
            safety absolutely required it. To rise "before day and travel until three or four
            o'clock in the afternoon, and then stand guard half the night, was a men. fearing- that
            due 316 SANTA CRUZ TO * *■ duty that we all felt severely, and eacli dreaded the night
            when his turn came. Last night was a very bad one, in fact, the worst we had experienced
            during our journey (the march across the Tucson desert always excepted), as it was
            exceedingly dark, and tlie rain came down in torrents. I kept a light burning in my tent
            the whole night, and made my rounds with a lan- tern. The strict watch kept by us during
            the march, no doubt saved us from robbery ; and, if there had been nothing to fear from
            the Indians, it was a safe- guard against the Mexicans, who are as great thieves as the
            Apaches. We had suffered much from theft in our last visit to Santa Cruz, and took good
            care that this pilfering should not be repeated. In the afternoon I called on Padre
            Pacheco with Dr. Webb, to make inquiries about Inez Gonzales. The result was very
            unsatisfactory. He manifested an in- terest in the welfare of the poor child, but said
            that he had no control over her or her family, and that his in- fluence or exertions
            would avail nothing against the plans or the doings of the military officers. Their
            power was supreme, particularly in an outpost like this. From all the information I
            could gather from the Padre, it was evident that unfair means had been resorted to by
            Captain Gomez ; first, in getting her away from her home under some pretence, and
            secondly, in depriving her of her liberty, and preventing her return with her mother to
            Santa Cruz. I have not before observed that the mother overtook us the day after leaving
            Tubac, and accompanied our train to her now desolate home. Believins: that Governor

            officer who had been ounded in the fight with the Apaches, and Capt Murphy, the officer
            in command at this place. The to town appeared to be very sickly, fevers being the pre-
            vailing form of disease. Of the troops here, which numbered a hundred men, thirty were
            disabled by illness. The prevalence of fevers arises from the prox- imity of a lare
            marsh between here and San Lazaro,. into town, I met parties of the inhabit- ants
            promenading. The women were neatly dressed, mostly in white, with dark rebosos over
            their heads ; "vhile the men who accompanied them were armed "ith muskets or lances,
            without which they never ven- ture beyond the walls. Even at the distance of our camp,
            which was within a mile of the town, our visitors "Were invariably ai'med. So with those
            immediately ynder the walls tending cattle, or in the fields plough- ing, all had their
            fire-arms at hand. Such is the state of things in this place. Of course, agriculture is
            neg- lected, and the people, being confined to that portion of the valley near the town,
            are able to raise barely h for their own subsistence a one a party of Apaches actually
            entered the town during the day, and drove ff a number of mules. These robbers were
            within gun-shot of the garrison, from which they were per- ceived by a sentinel. Yet
            such was the terror they 318 SANTA CRUZ TO inspired, that no attempts were made, either
            by the military or tlie%nliabitants, to repel them or rescue, the animals. Outside the
            walls were a number of cattle. These the robbers did not think proper to take, as they
            could not keep up with the mules. They therefore lanced them where they stood; and their
            bleached bones Btill remain under the walls, within a stone's throw of the dwellings, as
            testimonials of Mexican cowardice. I cannot conceive what object there is in support-
            ing this miserable population of less than two hundred souls, in an outpost where they
            are liable to the con- stant attacks and depredations of savages. The adja- cent valley
            is not occupied, although' one of the finest in the State. Better would it be for the
            government to take the whole population, not only of Santa Cruz, but also of Tubac and
            Tucson, remove them to the central parts of the State, and provide them with other land
            of equal value. As there are tracts equally good which are at present unoccupied, the
            govern- ment would be savers by this arrangement. The ex- pense of maintaining a
            battalion of five hundred troops in this quarter for two years, is greater than would be
            the cost of removing the whole population in question. If this is not practicable, then
            the government should encourage emigration to these valleys, and enable the people to
            protect themselves. It is quite possible, and I think it probable, that the town of
            Santa Cruz will be eventually abandoned by the present miserable remains of its
            inhabitants ; they will be compelled to this step to save themselves from starvation, or
            from being finally cut off by their more brave and warlike enemies. July 2Qth. This day

            imprisoned. He was the same man who killed the Apache at the Copper Mines, and had given
            me trouble at every settlement where we had stopped. I was therefore glad to get rid of
            him, and found no difficulty in filling his place. In fact, had I permitted them, half
            the population would have availed themselves of the opportunity that presented, to get

            outside my tent until he should return. The Padre brought me a bottle of wine, and
            another of excellent vinegar, which was very accept- able, together with a few
            vegetables ; in return for which, we gave him a few articles that he could not obtain

            the afternoon, a heavy rain set in. July 27th. A large party of emigrants from Arkan-
            sas, via El Paso, arrived just before night, and encamp- ed near us. They had twenty
            wagons, each drawn by five yoke of oxen. Soon after their arrival, they applied to me
            for flour. I told them I had barely sufficient to take us to El Paso, and directed them
            to apply to a mill in the town where it was for sale. I heard afterwards that they made
            a demand on the Padre for provisions ; and that they treated him rudely, sitting down
            without ceremony in the little piazza at his door, where they commenced playing cards
            with each other, and annoyed him exceedingly by their boisterous manner and inso- lence.
            July 2Stk Our repairs and shoeing being completed, we resumed our journey early this
            morning. Many of the inhabitants earnestly begged to be employed or to be permitted to
            accompany us, offering to aid us m any way in their power, without compensation. Feehng
            THE PRESIDIO OP JANOS. 321 pity for the poor creatures, I told several that tliey might
            accompany the train, if they would furnish their own provisions and transportation. Four
            of them fol- lowed us on foot ; and I afterwards found that the Mexican arrieros, and
            the cooks, kept them at work when in camp in bringing wood and water, as well as in
            herding the mules, and gave them their food for so doing. Hearing from the emigrants who
            arrived last even- ing, .that the road taken by them from the San Pedro river was very
            bad for loaded wagons, I determined to avoid it by following a path little known, which
            was some ten miles further. Instead, therefore, of passing directly over the hills on
            leaving the valley, we kept on three miles to the termination of these hills, and then
            took an easterly, though very tortuous course, keeping most of the way in valleys, and
            avoiding the mountains altogether. As we passed out of the valley, I observed a long
            train of wagons winding over the hills on the other road, accompanied by many horse-
            men. This was an emigrating party, which we had been told we should meet ; but we were
            not near enough to speak with them. After winding through these valleys for four miles,
            e ascended to the plateau, to which we kept for six or eight miles over a smooth
            gravelly plain, without a tree or a bush. The valleys below were studded with small
            oaks, and covered with luxuriant grass ; in fact, I was told at Santa Cruz, that in
            former years large Jierds of cattle were raised here. The countiy seems admirably
            adapted for the purpose, and in other hands, or when the Apache robbers are
            exterminated, will VOL. II. — 21 9 322 SANTA CRUZ TO et ain become a grazing countrj. Not
            a head was now to be seen ; nor is there another settlement, a single habitation, or a
            spot of cultivated ground between Santa Cruz and Janos in the direction we were travel-
            ling. * At two o'clock the rain began to fall in torrents ; and soon after, seeing a
            small basin of water near a grove of large walnut trees, we stopped and encamped, having
            travelled fifteen miles. This was the first daj, since leaving the vallejs of
            ■California, that we had met with oak groves and broad pastures. The whole country here
            assumed a new aspect, resembling the hills and valleys of Vermont or New Hampshire,
            rather than Mexico. Involuntarily we looked at the turn of every hill, as we wound
            through the valleys, to meet with farm houses, culti- vated fields, herds of cattle, and
            an agricultural popu- lation ; but all was silent as the grave. An occasional wolf
            sneaked across our path, or a herd of antelope bounded over the plain, reminding us that
            we were far from all human habitations. Juhj 2dth. The road or path we travelled yester-
            -day was very faint, and could no longer be traced. Our only course, therefore, was to
            follow the valley, which we knew must lead to the San Pedro. After keeping along it for
            three or four miles, Leroux set off over the hills, to see if he could find any trail.
            He at length found one, which he recommended us to take ; as following the valley might
            lead us to some canon, -and thus involve us in difiiculties. We therefore alter- cd our
            course from east to south, which we kept for four miles, and then entered the old road.
            Near this, we met two suspicious looking characters with gun 'J x r % THE PRESIDIO OF
            JANOS. -323 an unusual event iu these regions. We first discovered them at a distance,
            and on applying our spy-glasses, were still more puzzled, as they resembled Americans.
            On coming up, they proved to belong to a party of emigrants ahead, which they had left
            some hours before m search of deer or other game. They seemed as much surprised as
            ourselves at the meeting, and had many questions to ask. Their party was short of pro-
            visions, about which they felt more anxiety than about the state of the road or the
            grass. After striking the road, our course was again due east through a fine valley
            watered by a small stream ; the western tributary or source of the San Pedro. We
            followed this valley for about six miles, and met a train of twenty or tweiity-five ox
            -teams, with emigrants for California. We stopped a few minutes to exchange news with
            them, as well as to ask sundry questions about the state of the road, grass, water, and
            Indians ; toe result of which was more satisfactory to us than to them. On the south
            side of the valley we were traversing, erebold rocky clifis, about a hundred feet high;
            while on the opposite side, it was bounded by low hills 01 gravel. The valley was
            covered with grass, but not tree or shrub was visible. We crossed the stream over a
            rocky ledge, where there was but a few inches of water. Shortly before reaching it, we
            passed on our right the ruins of a village, which appeared to ave been long deserted.
            Amid these ruins, on the summit of a hill, there seemed to have been a fortifi- tion. We
            encamped directly by the crossing near tte base of a hill, where there were traces of
            previous 324 SANTA CRUZ TO M encampments. We estimated tlie distance travelled to-day at
            fourteen miles, making altogether, by tlie route we had come, twenty-nine miles from
            Santa Cruz ; while the usually travelled road does not exceed eighteen. Yet I would
            advise all travellers with wagons to turn to the right after crossing the San Pe- dro,
            and take our route, thereby avoiding one of the worst mountain passes in the whole
            distance to Califor- nia. With pack-mules, the shorter route should of course have the
            preference. Jidy OtJi. Passing round the base of the hill near our camp, we ascended the
            plateau, and then pursued a course due east, over a plain as level as a floor, and
            without a tree or shrub, covered with short grass that had sprung up since the rains.
            Five miles further, we again descended into a valley or bottom, through which ran a
            small stream, where we met another party of emigrants. After keeping the bottom for five
            miles, we reached a swampy place, caused by a recent accu- mulation of waters from the
            heavy rains. In the midst of this was a stream, or rather, I think, a gully, filled with
            water, which was running very rapidly. It was from two to three feet deep, and full of
            deeper holes, so that even the horsemen met with some difficulty in crossing. Fearing
            that we should break the tongues of our wagons in plunging down so abrupt and short a
            bank, the picks and spades were got out and both banks cut down ; we then all got over
            in safety. Crossing this boggy plain, our course continued eastward, through a bottom,
            for about six miles, the plateau bounding the valley on both sides. In t afternoon we
            began to ascend gradually through the THE PRESIDIO OF JANOS. 325 4 same valley, and at
            half-past three encamped near a stream, where the water merely stood in holes. It was
            very good, though, from appearance, not perma- nent. Near us was a large cotton-wood
            tree, the only- one to be seen ; so that it was with difficulty we could find scraps of
            wood enough to cook our dinner. From our camp we could see the mountain near Santa Cruz
            bearing due west. The rain set in before night, and continued several hours ; and as we
            were in a very exposed situation, it was necessary to put extra fastenings to the tents.
            Distance travelled to-day, fif- teen miles. July Ist Every thing was drenched with rain,
            which prevented an early start. We still kept due east, through an open defile in a
            mountain range, which ran north and south, with an easy and gradual ascent. On both
            sides were conical hills from three to four hundred feet in height, detached from the
            adjacent mountains, and destitute of trees and shrub- *ery. In fact, scarcely a tree or
            bush had been seen since we left the vicinity of Santa Cruz. As the coun- try continued
            bare to day, the men picked up every fragment of wood or brush we passed, and threw it
            into the wagons. It would be prudent for all parties tra- velling this country to
            provide themselves with wood whenever an opportunity ofiers, and always keep on hand a
            supply for three days. We were told by the emigrants we had passed, that their greatest
            difficulty had been to procure fuel ; and they cautioned encamped when we could, and not
            wait untU At two o'clock the rain began to fall ; but as there I- 1. 326 SANTA CRUZ TO
            was no water to be seen, we were reluctantly compels led to keep on until near niglit,
            when we reached a stream, called by Leroux " Ash Creek," where we en- camped. He said it
            was the same place where Colonel Cooke stopped with his battalion in 1846, and from
            which several parties were sent out in search of water, ag it was then dry. The stream
            is so called from the ash trees which grew near it, but which have now nearly
            disappeared, It is the toughest and best wood for repairing wagons ; and passing trains
            have stopped here to cut new tongues, and make other repairs. Dis- tance travelled,
            twenty miles. August 1st Our general course was still east, through defiles in the
            mountain's ridge we were then crossing, for about four miles, when we emerged into an
            open plain from twenty-five to thirty miles across. Keeping the same direction, slightly
            descending for nine miles, through a level plain covered with mezquit chapporal, we
            reached Agua Prtefa or the "Black Water Creek" of Colonel Cooke. My readers will
            recognise this as the spot were I encamped at the time of my visit to Fronteras in May,
            1851, when I was accompanied by Colonel Craig and a small party. It was then dry ; but
            now it was filled with a dark muddy water, whence it derives its name. This, like many
            other small streams we had lately passed, we now know is not permanent. After heavy
            rains, it receives the washings of the broad plains, which rise gradually on either side
            for many miles. As the next water we expected to find was at San Bernardino, eighteen
            miles distant, I thought it best to go no further, although it was but. twelve THE
            PRESIDIO OF JANOS. . 327 o'clock, and we had come not over thirteen miles. But as there
            was a bright sun, we could not do better than devote the remainder of the day to drying
            our .tents, blankets, saddles, and every thing that had been carried on mules. The packs
            were therefore over- hauled, and their contents, as well as the bedding, spread out to
            dry. The road to-day had been excel- lent, as it had for the most part since leaving
            Santa Cruz. Towards evening, an alarm was given by the Mexican arrieros that the Apaches
            were upon us, and after our mules, then a mile off. All flew to arms ; and in two
            minutes every animal about the camp was saddled, mounted, and off in pursuit, or rather
            to the aid of our cahallada, which we could see approaching . at full speed, followed by
            the herdsmen and arrieros, yelling and screaming at the top of their voices to keep up
            the stampede. The mules were evidently as much frightened as the Mexicans ; and such a
            state of commotion we had not beheld since we left California. Far across the plain we
            could see the supposed enemy approaching on horseba.ck, making directly for the camp at
            full speed. Having got my rifle ready and cocked, I drew out my telescope to ascertain
            the iiumber of the enemy, now about a mile ofi". To my great relief, I perceived that
            several were clad in dark coats, and that all wore hats, some of them black. This showed
            that they were neither Apaches nor Mexi- cans ; for the former do not wear hats at all,
            and the Matter at this season wear white calico shirts, with -traw hats. In a few
            minutes the supposed enemies 'ere with us, and proved to be a party of American 328
            SANTA .CRUZ TO emigrants in advance of a train of wagons, which our people did not see,
            or they would have caused no alarm. Perceiving the stampede they had caused, and hearing
            the yelling of the arrieros, they had hastened, forward to quiet our fears. This party
            consisted of thirty-five persons, men, women, and children, with mule-wagons and horses,
            from Arkansas and Texas. Their wagons had turned off to the left to a spring, where
            there was better water than in the stream two miles below us. After spending an hour in
            giving us some interesting news from our friends at El Paso and on the Rio Grande below
            that li place, they took leave of us and rejoined their party. They had seen a party of
            forty or more Apaches two days before near the Guadalupe Pass. August 2d We moved off at
            seven ; the morning clear and pleasant, and with the satisfaction of having dry tents
            and clothing once more ; for we had escaped the rain last night, probably from being so
            far from the mountains. Our course was still east, across the plain, to a high conical
            mountain capped with a rocky • bluff. The road was excellent until we reached the base
            of this mountain, when it became hilly, though not bad. After winding among these hills
            for three or four miles, we again emerged into a broad plain, in the middle of which
            stood the ruined hacienda of San Bernardino. We now descended again very gradually over
            a plain filled with mezquit chapporal, and six or seven miles further brought us to the
            hacienda. Is- tance travelled, eighteen miles. Just as we were entering this plain, we
            met Colo- nel Garcia, with a detachment of two hundred Mexi- THE PRESIDIO OF JANOS. 329
            can troops from -Tucson, on a campaign against the Apaches. A more miserable set of men
            I never met, certainly none calling themselves soldiers. Some of them were destitute of
            shirts, others of pantaloons, and some had neither coats nor hats. Some wore over-
            coats, without a rag of clothing beneath. They had seen no Indians, as might be
            expected, although forty were observed here the day before. In all probability the wily
            enemy had perceived them, and would follow them, in the hope of stealing some of their
            animals, and piercing some of them with a lance or an arrow. These campaigns against the
            Indians aie utterly use- they be attended with success. D o last two years that the
            Mexicans have been operating against them on this frontier, not fifty have been killed.
            The Indians are too cunning to risk an open fight, even with such antagonists. Their
            mode of warfare is ty stratagem, and they must be encountered with their own weapons.
            August 3d. We kept on our easterly course tp- ards the Guadalupe Mountains. Met a train
            of ox- teams with emigrants from Arkansas, and soon after entered the famous canon,
            where there was an abun- dance of water and grass. In passing a small ravine, one of the
            wagons upset, discharging its contents upon poor Mexican who happened to be seated
            inside, because too ill to sit upon his mule. Dr. Webb was sent for, but found the man
            not seriously injured, fortunately the wagon was not broken ; so that after a little
            delay all was made right again, and the train continued through the defile nntil three
            o'clock, when e stopped and pitched our tents where the road « 330 SANTA CRUZ TO takes a
            sudden turn, and leads over the mountains, through the much-dreaded Guadalupe Pass. I
            noticed near this spot traces of a large encampment, which Le- roux said was one of
            Colonel Cooke's in 1846. August 4.tJi. We commenced the ascent of the mountain
            immediately after leaving camp ; . and the animals being fresh, we reached the summit of
            the first hills with ease. I took my rifle and set off on foot, keeping near the train,
            as it would have been imprudent for the party to scatter in such a place. The descent of
            the first hill was difficult, being full of short turns, rocky and yery steep. About
            half way down, we took the mules out of my wagon, and let it down by hand, the driver
            taking the pole, while four of us held it back until it reached the bottom. • The
            baggage and subsistence wagons were got down m safety by attaching ropes behind and to
            one, side, to which ten or a dozen men held on, thus preventing them from upsetting or
            making a too sudden descent. Tke only vehicle that met with an accident was that
            containing Lieutenant Whipple's valuable instruments. Although more pains were taken
            with it than with any other, it was upset, and its contents thrown out, but happily
            without any damage either to the instruments or the wagon. The worst is a chalky hill,
            near the last in the pass. It is exceedingly smooth and steep, with short and very
            abrupt turns, so as to render it impossible to double a team, or even hitch six mules
            together to advantage. To ascend this place with loaded wagons, IS impossible. I sent
            Leroux off in the mornmg m advance with the pack-mules, directing him to pass all THE
            PRESIDIO OF JANOS. 331 f n'fc I t I f ► Y the hills, then discharge his loads, and
            return and meet me at the base of the chalky hill mentioned. I found him there on my
            arrival ; and we set to work at once to discharge the wagons. This being done, the con-
            tents were put upon the backs of the mules, which were sent ahead again to deposit their
            loads. We then took hold of the wagons ; and bj alternately pushing them and chocking
            the wheels, the mules got them up this formidable ascent with comparative ease. While
            this was going on I took a sketch of the pass, which will convey a better idea than a
            written description. It will be found in the first volume. On the summit of the hill we
            met a train of wagons with forty persons bound for California. They were a substantial
            hardy looking set of people, and had been four months on their journey from Arkansas. A
            magnificent view of the country in eveiy direc- tion is obtained from this spot. On
            looking back the way we had come, the whole pass with its defiles and mountains, its
            forests of oaks and pines, its deep gorges and grassy valleys, lay before us ; while in
            the very centre, protruded a huge pile of rocks of a light green and whitish color,
            presenting a pleasing contrast with the rich hue of the foliage around. Some of the
            hills Were covered with grass, and others were dotted with clumps of cedars, although
            small live and post oaks predominated. Beyond the pass could be seen the high conical
            mountain beyond San Bernardino ; and in the dim distance, an elevated chain near the San
            Pedro i'er, at the' base of which we passed. The perspec- tive of these receding
            mountains, the furthest more than a hundred miles distant, was exceedingly beautiful 332
            SANTA CRUZ TO Before one o'clock we had passed all the hills; when the wagons were
            reloaded, the mules packed, and we continued our journey. I here turned off and took the
            old Janos road, believing it to furnish a shorter route to El Paso than that by the
            Copper Mines, which we took in our journey into Sonora last year; besides I was desirous
            of varying my course, an4 examining the country further south. This road has been
            travel- led for nearly two centuries, or since the first settle- ment of the country. It
            is the only route practicable for wagons between Chihuahua and Sonora, and was only made
            so by Colonel Cooke. Nor is there any other for pack-mules, except one a short distance
            to the south leading from Correlitos to Babispe. Further south the great Sierra Madre is
            impassable for more than five hundred miles. When Colonel Cooke set out from Santa Fe
            for California, he came down the Rio Grande to the pre- sent ford at San Diego, and
            thence to Ojo de Taca. His most direct course would then have been west across the
            unexplored region lying between that place and the San Pedro ; but as his guide, Leroux,
            knew noth- ing of that country, he deemed it prudent, when so many lives were dependent
            on him, to follow a route with which he was acquainted. Accordingly he led them in a
            south-westerly course to the Guadalupe Pass, through which he knew there was a trail
            from Janos. In reaching this he had to pass over a district of fifty- two miles to Las
            Playas without water, in which his men suffered severely from thirst; and on reaching
            the pass, he was obliged to cut a road for his wago'ns, as wheeled vehicles had never
            before gone that way. i I THE PRESIDIO OF JAN03, 333 i. Emigrating parties, and all
            others, are mucli indebted to this gallant officer for opening this road, which
            otherwise would have remained in its ancient condition to the present dav. But with all
            the labor that has been or maj hereafter be bestowed upon it, it can never be- come the
            great thoroughfare for emigrants to California. The mountain pass must always remain an
            impedi- ment. The long tract from Ojo de Vaca to the ► Playas without water, is another;
            and the Guadalupe Pass presents the same difficulty in the dry season. A fourth
            objection is the distance, which is fully a hun- dred miles greater than a course nearly
            west from Ojo de Vaca, coming out near Tucson. The latter route was taken by the
            Commission last year, and the longest stretch without water was less than forty miles.
            Our government should send out a party to make explorations within our line of boundary
            ; when, I doubt not, a route would be dis- covered which would shorten the distance at
            least one hundred and fifty miles, besides furnishing wood, water, and grass in
            abundance. It is desirable, too, that we should have a road as far as possible within

            here opens to the view eastward and southward, extending far and wide, with short
            detached ridges of fountains, running generally from north-west to south- east. Our
            course was south-east, to a range of moun- tains whose direction is east and west,
            fifteen miles dis- 334 SANTA CRUZ TO taut. This great plain is lost in tlie horizon at
            the north-east, there being no mountains in sight; in a south-westerly direction, the
            Guadalupe range is seen some fifty miles distant, verging eastward, until it unites with
            the great chain of the Cordilleras. Our course lay towards a portion of the mountains
            where I presumed the pass to be. The plain was per- fectly level and the road excellent,
            without a stone, a tree, or a bush. When we had reached its centre, where there was a
            slight depression, we found that the drainage of the adjacent slopes had made it so miry
            as to be impassable by the direct road. We "therefo diverged to the right, keeping on
            higher ground, and got safely across. At 3 o'clock it commenced raining, with the wind
            from the south-west, when we would gladly have stopped ; but there was neither wood nor
            water at hand. We were, therefore, obliged to keep on anotber hour, when a spring with a
            small pool of water was discovered at the base of a plateau or terrace which extended
            about three miles from the mountains. Here we encamped. Estimated distance travelled,

            for three miles, and then entered a defile which led directly across the lower portion
            of the mountains. This defile was at first of easy ascent, through proves of small oaks
            A and cedars, and over a carpet of rich verdure. From this the road led directly up a
            hill, which, thoi steep, was a very hard one for the animals, being cjh cr Wholly
            composed of loose and rolling stones. The poor THE PRESIDIO OF JANOS. 335 f" creatures
            had a severe tug of it ; and altliouili I ascended slowly on foot, I readied tlie summit
            nearly an hour before all the wagons got up. Here we found a party of from forty to
            fifty emi- grants with ten ox teams. While waiting? for our wagons to come up, we seated
            ourselves beneath the trees, and entered into conversation with these people, who were
            quite an intelligent party, both of men and women. The usual inquiries were made of us
            about the road and the prospects in California. The women were very inquisitive, chiefly
            as to the difietculties they had yet to encounter. They had already been five months on
            their journey from Arkansas, and had lost several of their party by death; and one of
            the men had had a narrow escape from a large brown bear but an hour before, on the hill
            we were now about to descend. The ■ skin of the animal lay before us, bearing authentic
            tes- timonj to his immense size. It seems that as three of the men were scouring the
            adjoining woods, one of them discovered ijah bear, and discharged his rifle at him. The
            bear limped off into an adjacent thicket ; the man followed ; and as he approached the
            animal's place of concealment, the infu- riated creature sprang from the thicket and
            seized im. He was of course thrown, when a hard struggle took place for the mastery.
            The.bear bit him severe- ly in the leg ; while the man, after a violent effort, suc-
            ceeded in getting bis knife from its sheath, and plunged It into the animal's body. The
            struggle took ilace on" the brow of a steep hill, and near the brink of a preci- pice
            some twenty feet in height. Over this they both fell together, the bear, fortunately,
            being underneath, 336 SANTA CRUZ TO and striking on his back. This saved the man from
            injury, and released him from his antagonist's embrace. Lacerated as he was, he arose
            and prepared to act on the defensive, expecting the bear would again give battle ; but
            the latter, not feeling very comfortable from his wounds and his fall, stood quietly
            gazing at the man, for some moments, and then leisurely turned around and walked away.
            The man was not so badly injured as to prevent his walking ; and, as soon as the berar
            was out of sight, he called to his companions, and pointed out the direction taken by
            the animal. Follow- ing the track, they soon discovered him, and dispatch- ■m ed him
            with a couple of well-directed shots. We now descended the opposite slope of the moun-
            tain, which, though long and tedious, was not precipi- tous. Reaching the base in
            safety, we stopped on the banks of a beautiful little stream, which had its source in
            the mountain. Here it was thought advisable to water the animals and make a noon halt,
            as it was un- certain whether we should find water again for many miles. After a delay
            of three hours, which afforded us an opportunity to dine, we resumed our journey,
            keeping near the stream for three miles, and then strik- ing off into a very broad and
            level plain from twenty- five to thirty miles across, on which not a tree or a bush was
            to be seen.. Low gravelly hills of a conical form rose from the plain on our left from
            fifty to two hundred feet in height, covered with grass, but desti- tute of trees. On
            our right, about four miles distant, rose a high and isolated mountain with bold rocky
            sides. Opposite this we stopped at nine o' clock and encamped without water, having
            travelled twenty miles. r THE PRESIDIO OF JANOS, 337 August Qth. We contiuucd our

            "La Play a ;" for when there, I noticed that the plain stretched far to fhe south-west,
            unlimited by the mountains. Our attention was arrested to-day by the sight of the
            remains of two human bodies, but whether of Mexicans or Americans we could not
            determine. What Was left of their clothing consisted of white shirts and narrow white
            cotton drawers. The latter article is not worn by Mexicans, which led us to suppose the
            murdered men might have been our countrymen. In the afternoon we crossed a fine clear
            stream, thirty to forty feet wide and about two deep, occasion- ••iily expanding into
            ponds twice that depth, and en- camped on the opposite bank where there was excel- lent
            grass. This stream is a branch of the river which passes Janos and Correlitos, the

            extremity of a hill, from which a gentle descent of a mile brought us to the old

            rare an event for trains or travellers to enter Janos from the west, that our approach
            created quite a sensation among its quiet people. We stopped in toe main street as we
            passed along, and were at once accosted by some . Americans, who advised us to en- camp
            near the river on the opposite side of the town ; which we did, and found good grass
            near. Janos is one of the seven presidios or military posts, a line of which was formed
            along the frontier as carin- as 1718. The others were Galeana, Carrizal, Norte, Cojome,
            San Eleazario, and San Carlos. These posts Were of great service in subduing the Indians
            and pro- tectmg the inhabitants, and were connected with a greater chain which extended
            from San Antonio in Texas to San Francisco in California. A direct and constant
            communication was kept up between these 340 JANOS TO CORRELITOS, posts until the period
            of the subversion of the Spanish rule. They have since been retained and occupied for
            the same purpose as before, but have dwindled frgm respectable garrisons of well
            disciplined soldiers, to a mere handful of raw militia, as undisciplined as they are
            wanting in bravery. In the year 1826, the force in Janos consisted of six commissioned,
            and ninety non-commissioned officers and privates, and was supported at an annual cost
            of 26,894. It now numbers twenty soldiers ; but this force is augmented from time to

            inroads of the universal enemy, the Apaches. The present population is but three hnn-
            di'ed, and even these dare not venture far beyond the town, but lounge out a miserable
            existence beneath the shade of the adobe walls, changing their position as the shadows
            change. The streets have a desolate and forsaken appearance. No one seemed to be at work
            ; and such as were not squatting under the walls were engaged in gambling. The presidio
            buildings occupied by the military, are in a state of ruin. Before going to camp, I rode
            to the quarters of the commanding officer, Colonel Medina, who had extend- ed many

            wished to rejoin were travelling with ox-teams. But they were in trou- ble about their
            animals. Two of them, having strayed away, had been refused to deliver them ed by the
            Mex who up, on the ground that they belonged to the party which had left. I accordingly
            addressed a note to Colonel Medina, stating such facts tisfy him of the ownership of the
            animals; whereupon he complied with my request, and ordered the men who held them to
            deliver them up forthwith. He found an American "herb," or " Thomsonian as to 11 doct or

            of getting the latter sum. August 8. A horse died last night from the bite of a
            rattlesnake received three days before. We start- ed this morning, pursuing a course
            south-east by east across an open and level plain about 12 miles in width, and of a
            desert-like character, which it assumes imme- diately after lejiving the river. In one
            instance, I noticed a patch of grama grass half a mile in width, extending across the
            plain as far as the eye could reach. This desert, or plateau, is but little elevated
            above the bottom lands of the river, and is composed of a fine gravel. The bottom lands
            along the San Miguel are fertile, and yield abundant crops of wheat, corn, and the usual
            products of the country; although, at present, much of this fine soil has been suffered
            to run waste, on account of the hazard of cultivating it- There was formerly much stock
            raised here ; but so completely have the Indians got possession of the vicinity, that
            there are not horses and cattle enough left to cultivate the soil. The road continued
            excellent, and the train made good progress. On our left I noticed the course of the
            river winding across the plain, marked by a long line of cotton-woods. Crossing this
            plain, we passed around the base of some gravelly hills, and then con- tinued in a more
            easterly direction over a similar pla- teau for ten miles, which brought us to
            Correlitos, a town standing on the eastern bank of the San Miguel, or Casas Grandes
            River, as it is called here. ■n fr AND VISIT TO CASAS GRANDES. 343 On arriving at the
            river, I found, greatly to my surprise, a large and rapid stream, much swollen by the
            late rains, and about 100 yards in width. At first we hesitated whether to cross the
            stream at once, or wait till the following morning ; as the people said the water would
            then be several inches lower, provided there was no more rain. We concluded, however, to
            attempt it as it was; which was fortunate for us. After some search, a fordable place
            was found ; and notwithstanding the strength of the current, we suc- ceeded with care in
            getting every thing bver in safety. As a general rule, it is best always to cross a
            stream immediately, so as to encamp on the opposite side ; for should there be a fall of
            rain, or an overflow of the river from other causes, it might be found impassable in the
            morning, and perhaps continue so for several days. Four mules which had been driven
            along sev- eral days with sore backs and otherwise disabled, being unfit to go further,
            were abandoned here. August Wi. As a supply of fresh meat and vege- tables was wanted, I
            determined to remain here a few tours, and after breakfast walked to the town, about a
            quarter of a mile distant, to see what could be had ; for we were yet 160 miles from El
            Paso, and could procure nothing after leaving this place. I had sent to Ihe town
            immediately on our arrival last evening, to engage some cattle or sheep, and was told
            that they would be in the corral this morning for selection ; but wben I called, they
            were still several miles off. Some Jnen were sent after them ;. and in the mean time, I
            yent to examine some large furnaces, where the silver s extracted from the ore taken
            from a mijae in the vicinity. 344 JAXOS TO CORRELITOS, Althougli these smeltiDg works
            are a very indifferent and primitive affair, jet they are said to produce a large r
            nmoLint of silver, and to yield to their owner, Senor Zn- loaga, a handsome income. The
            ore is taken from a mountain eighteen miles distant, and brought hither in carts to be
            smelted. The owner was absent ; but the superintendent was very polite to us, taking us
            through the establishment and pointing out the several processes used in extracting the
            metal, as well as explaining to us the various qualities of ore. One of the greatest
            difficulties which attend the smelting here is the scarcity of firewood. As there are no
            forests near, the roots of mezquit bushes are almost exclusively used. These roots, it
            is true, afford excellent fuel ; but they are obtained with much labor, and the supply
            must sooner or later cease, as no more is produced. Correlitos is a mud-built modern
            town, containing about four hundred inhabitants, who depend wholly upon the mine and
            smelting works for their living. There is some fine bottom land near ; but little of it
            is cultivatecT. At the time of my visit, the streets were filled with mud holes, half
            full of putrid water, in which swine were wallowing ; and the people looked sickly as
            well as filthy, caused by the strong fumes of arsenic which proceed from the furnaces
            and are disseminated through the town. These fumes were so powerful, that when the wind
            blew towards our camp, half a mile distant, they were quite offensive. The super-
            intendent gave me some fine specimens of ore, as well as of the product in its various
            stages as it undergoes reduction. AND VISIT TO CASAS GRANDES. 345 • The Apaches, I was

            beeves had not come in, nor the promised vegetables ; and as it would require an hour or
            two after the cattle arrived to kill one and distribute the meat, making it too late to
            leave to-day, I directed the mules, which eady hitched up and ready to move, to be

            inquiries, but with no better results. When I had come to the conclusion that the ruins,
            of which so much had been said, must have crumbled away and' disappeared, a Mexican who
            had heard of my inouiries, and who felt some interest in the antiquities of his country,
            called upon me, and advised me by all means to visit the D place, now that I was within
            so short a distance of it, me that there was much there to repay my curiosity. Following
            the river up in a course nearly south, we reached the village of Barranca ColoVada, four
            miles distant, where I stopped to call on Mr Lewis Flotte. an American gentleman Ions-
            resident there. and the owner of a silver mine which is situated in the same mountain
            with that of Mr. Zuloaga, whose smelt- ing: works I visited at Correlitos. Mr. Flotte
            had gone to Chihuahua ; but his mayor-domo received us politely, and showed us 'through
            his works, which are more extensive and better arranged than those at Correlitos. He had
            six furnaces, four of which were in full blast, while the hearths were being replaced on
            the others preparatory to their being lighted again. The machinery which kept the
            bellows in motion was propelled by mules. The superintendent took us through the
            establishment, describing the various processes, and gave us a set of specimens of the
            ores. We learnt here, as we did at Correlitos, that Mr. Flotte had been badly treated by
            'the owner of the other mine, and that he was about to sell out his estate m |

            to the mayor-domo at the mine, after which we resumed our journey. . Following the
            river, which we crossed near Bar- ranca, we kept down the valley about sixteen miles,
            when we came to a beautiful grove of large cotton- wood trees, extending from the river
            across the bottom to the very bank or edge of the plateau, which here rises from twenty
            to twenty-five feet above the valley. Passing this grove, we suddenly emerged into a
            broad and luxuriant valley or bottom, extending as far as the eye could reach towards
            the south. -From the pla- teau, we could irace the course of the stream by the deep
            green foliage of the long line of cotton-woods which grow on its banks. r From the point
            where I stood I noticed, about a mile distant, the ruins of a large building on the
            verge of the plateau, near which the road passed. As we approached, several others of
            lesser dimensions were seen, both on the plateau and in the bottom near its hase. It
            required but a glance at these buildings to show what they were, the first being a
            church, with its entire walls standing, together with a portion of its tower. Remains of
            tombs were also visible ; but from the decayed and weather-worn appearance of the walls,
            the church had long been abandoned. The ruins near Were those of haciendas and ranchos,
            some of them luite extensive ; from which I inferred that the town as originally here,
            though it now stands two miles beyond. As we entered the town, which bears on account of
            these ruins the name of Casas Grandes, we attracted 348 JANOS TO CORRELITOS, much
            attention from its quiet and retired inhabitants, who, in this remote and secluded spot,
            are seldom dis- turbed by visitors, save those who come on some errand connected with
            the church. Gasas Grandes is not a ace of business, nor is it on any great thoroughfare,

            here, which I sent on in advance hj my Mexi- can servant, that he might find the persons
            to whom they were addressed, and then 'return and meet me. Unfortunately, both the
            gentlemen were absent. The man, however, had shown the letters to another gentle- man,
            who had read them, and who Tequested that we should stop at his house. We accordingly
            drove up to a respectable looking adobe heuse, where we were met by well-dressed per-
            sons, and received with much politeness. Being con- ducted into the house, we Were
            scarcely seated before the room was pretty well filled with visitors, to see who .the
            strangers were. I made myself and companion known, as well as the object 'of our visit ;
            viz., to see the ruins' near by, or as they called them the " Casas de Montezuma." Our
            host soon began to make prepara; tions for dinner ; but as it was then five o'clock, an
            hut little time remained before dark, I requested him to defer the meal until evening,
            that we might make the most of our time in examining the ruins while day- light lasted.
            This being arranged, Dr. Webb and myself set off for the ruins, accompanied by our host
            and three or four others. Being but half a mile from the village, they were soon
            reached, when, after a hasty walk among ttem, I seated myself on a small knoll, or
            mound, and occupied myself while there remained any light in leaking a sketch. The
            Doctor, in the mean time, was engaged in searching among them for relics. We re- 350 .

            mezquit chapporal, and partook of an excel- lent supper with such appetites as people
            might be sup- posed to have who had not eaten since sunrise. The evening was spent in
            questioning our friend about the ruins, and in selecting, some fragments'of pottery from
            a peck or more which the boys who had accompanied us had picked up, I having set them to
            work for the purpose. The ruins of Casas Grandes, or Great Houses, face the cardinal
            points, and consist of fallen and erect walls, the latter varying in height from five to
            thirty.feet, and often projecting above the heaps of others which have fallen and
            crumbled away. If the height were esti- mated from their foundations, it would be much
            greater, particularly of those in the central parts of the build- ing, where the fallen
            walls and rubbish form a mound twenly feet, above the ground. If, therefore, the high-
            est walls now standing have their foundation on the lowest level, they have a height of
            from forty to fifty feet ; and as these ruins have stood exposed to the elements for
            more than three, centuries, they must originally have been much higher. Indeed the
            thick- ness of the walls, some of which are five feet at their base, would indicate that
            they must have been much higher than they now appear. From a close examination of what
            remains of the building or buildings, I came to the conclusion that the outer portions
            were the lowest, and not above one story in height, while the central ones were from
            three to six stories. Hence the large heaps of ruined walls and rubbish in the centre,

            preservation and support of that portion of the edi- fice. By far the larger portions
            which have fallen are the exterior walls. This arises from the moisture of the earth and
            the greater exposure to rains. The cen- tral parts are in a measure protected by the
            accumula- tion of rubbish', and by the greater thickness of their walls. I should
            observe that eveiy portion of this edifice IS built of adobe, or mud, and that nowhere,
            as far as I could trace the foundations, could I discover any alls of stone. The point
            in which it differs from the work of the Spaniards or modern Mexicans, is in the mode of
            constructing the walls. The latter employ regularly made brick, from fourteen to sixteen
            inches in length, about twelve in width, and three or four in •thickness, often mixed
            with chopped straw and gravel, and baked in the sun — a, mode adopted ages ago by the
            primitive inhabitants of Egypt, Assyria, and other Oriental countries, and practised by
            them at the pre- sent day. But the buildings of which I now speak «ire built with large
            blocks of mud, or what the Mexi- cans call tapia about twenty-two inches in thickness,
            and three feet or more in length. In fact, the length of these blocks seemed to vary,
            and their precise iiniensions could not be traced ; which induced me to helieve that
            some kind of a case or box was used, into Hch the mud was placed, and as it dried, these
            cases ere moved along. It is true, they may have been first made in moulds or cases,
            and, after being dried, placed on the walls ; but the irregularity and want of
            uniformity in these layers as to their length, leads me to believe they were made on t£e
            walls themselves. 352 JA'OS TO CORKELITOS,. The mud is filled witli coarse gravel from
            tlie plateau, which gives greater hardness to the material. In this respect I consider
            it superior to the modern adobe, which is oftener made without any gravel or straw,
            although in the better class of buildings, I have seen both used. In the town of El Paso
            there are some old division ' walls from three to four feet high, connected with the
            earliest buildings in the place, that are built of large blocks of adobe, well filled
            with gravel, of a siniilar character with those in the " Casas Grandes ;" but in no ;
            buildings of the Mexicans have I seen them used. I ■ have also seen modern fences made
            in the same man- ner of the common mud taken from the fields. ' All adobe walls, whether
            of buildings or mere fences, decay first at their base, from the moisture ; which
            'causes them to fall over. Such is the case with the modern as well as the ancient
            buildings. When pros- trate, the water easily permeates them ; in a few years they
            crumble in pieces, and are reduced to the original mud and gravel from which they were
            made. The outer walls of the Casas Grandes are or be traced by long lines of rounded
            heaps parallel to, or at right angles with, the walls now standing ; while !iere and
            there a corner of the original wall may be seen, or where it was intersected by a
            transverse wall which tended to support the other and bind them to- posi Sc gether.
            These corners often retain their erect tions long after the other portions have fallen
            with the higher and more massive walls of the interior, which are five feet in thickness
            at their base : the sides ger walls have "fallen, while the 'J with f AND VISIT TO CAS

            resemblin£ at a distance the isolated columns of a ruined temple. In so ruinous a state
            are these buildings, that it is extremely difficult to trace their original form. In
            approaching them one first meets with the low walls or embankment, which any where else
            would be taken for a work of nature ; but the transverse heaps connecting them with the
            standing wallsat once show them to have been similar, though of less height. A closer
            inspection brings to view a portion of a corner which has not fallen. As the vis- itor
            approaches the interior, where the edifice is in a better state of preservation, he
            becomes confused g the erect and fallen portions; for thelcgi o sides are mostly
            prostrated, while the shorter ones, and those forming angles, are standing. In this
            dilemma I found it best to take a stand upon the highest point, hich is a mound in the
            very centre of the erect Walls, as well as the centre of the edifice. From this point,
            after having examined and traced the exterior portion, one may form a tolerably correct
            idea as to the arrangement of the edifice. It was not until I had walked several times
            around it and traced its inner apartments, that I could satisfy myself of its actual
            outline. M first I believed that there were three separate tuildings, even when I took
            my sketch, as there were three large heaps, apparently unconnected, each having portions
            of erect walk But on closer examination, I found that they had been connected by a low
            range of buildings, which may have been merely courts, as they Jere of but one story. On
            the supposition, tbere- fcre, that all were connected either by low buildings or VOL. n.
            — 23 354 JAXOS TO C0RRELIT03, corridors, the entire edifice must have extended from
            north to south at least 800 feet, and from east to west about 250. On the south side a
            regular and continuous wall can be traced, while the eastern and western fronts are
            extremely irregular, with projecting walls. There appears to have been several courts
            within the inclo- sure, of greater or less dimensions. The general character of this
            extensive range of buildings is the same as that of the Casas Grand es, near the Pimo
            villages, on the Gila, and they are unquestion- ably the work of the same people. The
            material, too, is the same as that of the ruins on the Salinas. Like the edifice on the
            Gila, it is built with huge blocks of mud,laid up in the same manner, though, from some
            cause, probably the lesser tenacity gf the adobe, the walls are in a greater state of
            decay. In no other way can this decay be accounted for, unless a greater an- tiquity is
            allowed for these than for the Gila edifice, which would be contrary to all preconceived
            opinions of them. The ruinous state of these buildings may also be attributed to the
            more frequent rains to which they .are exposed than those on the Gila. The walls of the
            present building are much decay- ed ; in fact one half of their thickness is washed
            away, .and it is only by digging below the surface that their original thickness can be
            seen. In the Gila edifice, the inner surface of the walls is as perfect as though the
            mason had but yesterday passed his trowel over them, and the exterior ones are but
            little injured. In these ruins, on the contrary, no portion of the surface is visible. I
            sought for this, in order to ascertain if they had been plastered inside or out ; but it
            could only ue AND VISIT TO CASAS GEANDES. 355 decided by digging to the foundation,
            which I had not time to do. Several portions of the walls within the area, and in
            particular one midway between the most southwardly building and the one to the north,
            had fronts precisely like that on the Gila ; their doors were similarly placed, and
            receded towards the top, and the same circular openings were seen in the upper partition
            walls. So much of the walls had washed away, that I could not trace the cavities where
            the beams were inserted, and hence was unable, as in the Gila edifice, to ascertain the
            number of stories, or how the beams were laid, 'Not a fragment of the woOd forming the
            beams or lintels could be discerned. Many doorways remained; but the lintels being gone,
            the tops had crumbled away or fallen. Although these ruins are alluded to by many of the
            earlier as well as the recent writers on Mexico, I have been unable to find in any
            author an accurate or full description of them. I have been particularly de- sirous to
            see some early account, that I might know their appearance when first seen by the
            Spanish colo- nists, who traversed this country anterior to the year 1600. Ribas, one of

            nation that occupied the country where they are found, their manners, customs, religion,
            etc. I find, however, in Clavigero* a brief account, which that • History of Mexico.
            8vo. ed. vol. i. p. 151. Xt 356 JANOS TO COERELITOS, laborious investigator doubtless
            had authority for. He repeats the old story that this edifice, ''agreeably to the
            universal tradition of these people, was built by the Mexicans in their peregrination,"
            That it con- sisted of '' three floors with a terrace above them, and without any
            entrance to the under floor. The door for entrance to the building is on the second
            floor, so that a scaling ladder is necessary." This would show r that at some period
            since the settlement of the country its floors remained. The other details in Clavigero
            are incorrect, and unquestionably refer to another edifice, which was built of stone,
            was roofed, and "surrounded by a wall seven feet thick." He also calls it a "fortress,"
            which term cannot be applied to this structure. I am of opmion that our author either
            mistook the sense of the writer he obtained his information from, or has blended the
            descriptions of two different buildings. Garcia Conde also states* that this edifice is
            known to have had "three stories and a roof, with stairs out- side probably of wood,"
            and that the same kind of structures are found at the present time among the pu- eblos
            of the independent Moquis," north of the Gila. He also repeats the story of the itec
            emigration, and that this was the third stopping-place of that people on their way from
            the North to the valley of Mexico. There is a class of apartments in this edifice, the
            object of which I am unable to conjecture, unless they were intended as depositories for
            maize, beans, and other agricultural products, or in other words, a gra- • Ensajo

            357 narj. These apartments, whicli are arranged along' of the main walls, are twenty

            too contracted for 'dwellin places or sleeping-rooms, with connecting doorways and into
            which the light was admitted by circular apertures in the upper part of the walls. The
            number and extent of these long and narrow apartments, with- out windows, led me to
            believe they were used for granaries. There were also large halls ; and some in-
            closures within the walls are so extensive, that they could never have been covered with
            a roof, but must have been open courts. The lesser ranges of buildings, hich surrounded
            the principal one, may have been occupied by the people at large, whose property was
            deposited within the great building for safe keeping. Although there is less order in
            the tout eiisemlh of *tis great collection of buildings than in those at the orth ; the
            number, of small apartments, the several stages or stories, the courts within, and some
            of the minor details, resemble in many respects the large edifices of the semi-civilized
            or Pueblo Indians of New Mexico. The position of these buildings differs from that of
            those near the Gila and the Salinas. Tlie latter ere built upon the plateau or table,
            just above the 358 JANOS TO COREELITOS. bottom land which their occupants had
            cultivated. The former stand on the declivity, with portions extending both on the
            plateau and on the bottom. The bank here is about twenty feet in height. Why so built I
            cannot imagine, unless excavations were made in the bank for store rooms. Wherever these
            old structures are found, ■ they show much sagacity on the part of their builders, who
            must have had some object in view in adopting the plan just mentioned. As a general
            custom at the present day, among the Mex- ■ icans, their villages and ranchos are built
            upon the plateau above the valley, or cultivated bottom, and on spots where there is no
            vegetation, except such plants as are peculiar to the deserts. Not a blade of grass can
            flourish there. I supposed this to be for two rea- sons : first, that the valleys are
            sometimes overflowed, and in rainy seasons are extremely wet and damp ; while on the
            gravelly plateau, which is hard and smooth, it is always dry. The second reason is, that
            being elevated, the people have a good view of their cultivated grounds, can trace their
            cattle and herds with ease, and discover the approach of an enemy. On the western or
            upper side, some sixty to eighty yards from the building, are three mounds of loose
            stones, about fifteen feet Jiigh, no doubt the burial places of the chiefs or great men.
            I would have opened these, but had not the time or facilities for so doing. If these
            were burial places, and there are no indications of places of sepulture elsewhere, some
            valuable relics might be found beneath them. I made particular inquiry of my Mexican
            friends, who were familiar with every spot of ground in this AND VISIT TO GASAS GEANDES

            these, about two hundred feet distant on the plateau, are the remains of a building, the
            dimen- sions of which I did not take, but think it about 150 feet square. But small

            tance, he says, they uniformly have the appearance of small hills or mounds, and in all
            that have been excavated, there have been found jars (cantaros), pitchers, ollas,* etc.,
            of pottery, painted with white, blue, and scarlet colors ; corn grinders (metates), and
            stone axes, but no instrument of iron. The builders of this edifice, and the occupants
            of the rich valley in the vicinity, showed much sagacity in their choice of so fine a
            region for agricultural purposes. There is none equal to it from Ahe low lands of Texas,
            near San Antonio, to the fertile valleys of California, near Los Angeles ; and, with the
            excep- tion of the Eio Grande, there is no river of equal size iSetween those of Eastern
            Texas and the Colorado of California. The water, too, is clear and sweet, unlike the
            muddy waters of the Rio Grande, the Pecos, and the Colorado, which are charged with
            vegetable mat- ter and earth. Many beautiful articles of pottery have from time to time
            been found here, the texture of which is much superior to that made at the present day
            by the Mex- icans. This pottery has chiefly a white or a red ground, ornamented with a
            variety of angular figures : Ollas (pronounced oyas) are the most common of all the
            utensils of pottery used by the Indians or present Mexicans. They are of various
            capacities, from half a pint to six gallons. Suspended by a cord over the fire they are
            used for cooldng in, and are in universal use for carrying water. The household utensils
            of the poorer Mexicans consist entirely of an assortment of these useful articles. * r 9

            purpose of comparing them with the pottery found at the Gila and the Salinas. They will
            also serve for comparison with the pottery of the Moquis, Zunis, and other Pueblo
            Indians, as well as with the ornaments made by the present Pimos and Coco-Maricopas.
            When so little remains of a people, the smallest fragments of their works of art become
            important. It is for this reason I have given so many specimens of their ornaments. On
            the summit of the highest mountain south-west of the ruins, and about ton miles distant,
            there was pointed out to me an ancient fortress of stone, from which the whole country
            for a vast extent can be viewed. It is attributed to the same people who erected the
            "Casas Grandes," and was doubtless in- tended as a look-out. This fortress can be
            discerned with the naked eye, and on looking at it through my spy-glass, it showed quite
            distinctly. I did not visit it, as it would have required a day, which time I could not
            spare. We were told that this building was a stone for- tress of two or three stories,
            with a very solid founda- tion. I think that the description of Clavigero refers both to
            the adobe edifices I have described and to this fortress, and that the worthy historian
            was not aware of their being separate structures.* . * This edifice is constructed on
            the plan of those of New Mexico, that is, consisting of three floors, with a terrace
            above them, and witn- out any entrance to the lower floor. The doorway is in the second

            nearly north by the town and ruins of the same name, the towns of Barranca, Colorada,
            Correlitos, and Janos, and, after a course of 62 J leagues, is discharged into Lake
            Guzman. It receives a tribu- tary nine miles north of Janos ; a second one at that town,
            which bears its name; and a third about ten miles below the ruins called Temeivaca. Yet
            not- withstanding these tributaries and the large volume of water, it often dries up,
            and remains only in pools barely sufficient for the population and the herds of cattle
            which graze upon its banks* The valley here is about two miles in width, covered with
            luxuriant fields of grass, wheat, and corn. The river passing through its centre is
            marked by a line of gigantic cotton-woods, while in various detached spots are groups of
            the same. The acequias which intersect the valley in every direction, are, bke the
            river, lined with a thick growth of shrubbery. Beyond the valley rises the plateau,
            which has a gradual ascent to a low range of hills about eight Hiiles distant ; beyond

            west, seated on the top of the little mounds referred to, in which the whole extent of
            the buildings is shown, with the valley and mountains beyond. This I have shown in three
            parts, to exhibit them more distinctly. Two of these are wood cuts ; the third, the
            small lithograph. The other is taken from a point near the south-eastern corner, showing
            portions of the walls which are not seen in the first sketch. This view is given in the
            large lithograph facing the title-page of this volume. As may be seen in the sketches,
            low mezquit bushes have taken root around the buildings, as well among its walls as in
            its apartments. On the west, the plateau extends to a range of low mountain about five
            miles distant, running in a line from north- west to south-east. The river bottom and
            adjacent plateau are about fifteen miles in width, which is about the average width from
            Janos to Casas Grandes. Proceeding south, these mountains appear to" approach, thereby
            contracting the plateau and valley. The latter, I was told, continues fertile far to the
            south, and is as highly cultivated as any portion of the country. August IQth. From our

            men, whom I had engaged r o"""o unable to complete my Survey of the edifice and its
            numerous walls, which it would have required the labor of several men, for at least two
            days, to accomplish in a satisfactory manner. At 11 o'clock, being pretty tired and
            hungry, we returned to the house of our friend to breakfost ; after ch the wagon was
            brought up, and our Correlitos. where we arrived at four o'clock pleased with i to dig

            and which it was believed had been a sort of kitchen ; but we found nothing but broken
            pottery, an obsidian arrow-head, and some * small marine shells. Leaving Dr. Webb to
            superintend these excafations, I set to work to take a ground plan of the buildings, as
            far_ as it was possible to do so ; but the Mexicans who undertook to assist me were far
            from adepts in the business, and caused me much annoy- ance. This was not a little

            course over a plain of very gen- tle ascent for about fifteen miles towards a conical
            mountain. We then entered a defile, and soon after reached tlie base of tlie mountain,
            where we found F- water, and encamped. In this conical mountain are the two silver mmes
            of Senor Zuloaga and Mr. Flotte, whose smelting works we had visited at Correlitos and
            Barranca. As soon as the camp was arranged, I set off with several others to inspect
            them. The mines are on the oppo- site sides of a ravine or indentation, which makes up 7
            into the mountain, and their entrances are not more than a hundred yards apart. On the
            hill sides, around and above the entrances, are the habitations of the work- men ; most
            of them . are built of the rock excavated in mining, and from a little distance have a
            most singular appearance. 1 i I i *■ \ TO EL PASO. . 367 r I first went to Mr. Flotte's
            mine. I presented my letter of introduction to the superintendent, a native Castilian,
            and was received by him with the politeness that characterizes his countrymen. After
            sitting a short time in his house near the entrance, we were each provided with torches
            ; whereupon we descended the mine, following the footsteps of our guide, the super-
            intendent himself It was quite muddy, owing to the late rains. The shaft was between six
            and seven feet high, branching off in various directions. We traced it to its bottom,
            which was eighty varas, or about 240 feet, from the entrance. The principal vein of ore
            is about five inches in thickness; there is also another of one inch. Both have a dip of
            about 45 degrees. The entire length of the various shafts is 300 varas, or 820 feet. On
            returning to the house of our attentive guide, he presented us with fine specimens of
            the ore. We did not go further than the entrance of the other inine ; as it was late,
            and the mine did not materially differ from the one we had examined. August 12th. Our
            journey to-day was twenty-five iiiiles. After leaving camp, our road wound for a cou-
            ple of miles through the hills, and then emerged into a broad plain, interspersed at
            intervals of two or three lilies with conical hills, from one to three hundred feet in
            height. Some of these were capped with a ridge or mass of stone, of a reddish color,
            resembling a work of art. Five miles further brousht us to Walnut Creek, a small run of
            water, which is dry except at this sea- so, and even then contains but little water.
            Half a dozen walnut trees of a small size, grow upon its banks, whence its name. After
            crossing this rivulet, • 368 COREELITOS our course was north-east without variation,
            over a slightl}' undulating plain, covered with grama grass. A dark line of trees now
            showed itself far in the dis- tance, indicating a water-course, which we reached at 5
            o'clock, and which proved to be the Santa Maria. The road had been excellent since
            leaving Correlitos, including the mountain defile. A heavy cloud arose as we approached
            the stream ; and we had barely got our tents pitched and well stayed, before it burst
            over our heads, accompanied by a violent wind. Vhen a few miles from camp this morning,
            a man got up from behind a bush, where he appeared to have been concealed, and joined
            the train. He proved to be a Mexican, who wished to accompany us to El Paso. Soon after
            two men on horseback overtook us, r r and handed me a note from the superintendent of
            the mine, stating that one of his men had run away, and asking permission to take him in
            case he had joined our train. I could not, of course, interfere in the matter, and gave
            orders that the men should not be obstructed in arresting the runaway. The poor fellow,
            who was a peon, was very reluctant to return ; but his captors were armed with sabres
            and rifles, and all resistance Avas unavailing. As we journeyed on, we saw blows
            inflicted on the poor creature, who was, no doubt, destined to spend the remainder of
            his days at hard labor for the benefit of his owner. Our Mexican arrieros were anxious
            to liberate him ; but as we were on Mexican territory, with liberty to go whither we
            pleased in the performance of our official duties, inter- ference would have been
            unjustifiable. August IWl. We remained two hours longer than r TO EL PASO. 369 V L r
            usual this moriiiug, to give the mules a chance to feed. Near us were some walls of old
            stone buildings, where a number of stone arrow-heads, and clippings of jasper, flint,
            and obsidian were found, showing that here had been a work-shop of the natives. A few
            weeks previous, a party of four Americans was here surprised and surrounded by a band of
            some 15 or 20 Apaches. The men were armed with rifles and pistols, which enabled them to
            keep the savages , at bay. Whenever the latter exposed themselves, the Americans gave
            them a shot, and killed, as they be- heved, several. * After being thus encompassed for
            three days, protected in a measure from the arrows of the enemy by a little wall which
            they raised, and after they had all been wounded, one of their number crept out at night
            and made his way to Correlitos, where he applied for relief It was granted ; but they
            were compelled to pay 500 for it. I ascended a hill near our camD, from which I could
            trace the course of the Santa Maria, by the line of trees along its banks. A broad plain
            extended for many miles on either side without a tree or a shrub. Our course continued
            north-east, without change, Pver the same level 2:)lain we had been traversing, of clay
            or gravel, with occasional patches of grass and a lew mezquit bushes. Passed some holes
            of rain-water, here we stopped to water our animals. The hills and fountains, which here

            prevailing with the hills ; while the mountains, which erefrom 1500 to 2000 feet high,

            There were no continuous ranges to be seen ; but all were isolated, or in groups, rising
            abruptly and extending but a few miles. At 3 o'clock, the usual black cloud began to
            rise at the south, portending rain, which warned us to make camp before it reached us.
            We took ad to of a little patch of grass, where the animals might obtain a scanty meal,
            and stopped. Every man with- out exception, at once set to work ; and within a very
            short space of time the tents were pitched, trenches dug, and the camp-fires made.
            Scarcely was this completed, when the storm was upon us ; and but for the extra ropes
            and stays put to the tents, all would have been blown away. But as it was, we sat
            quietly within, listening to the peals of thunder, and watching the vivid flashes of
            lightning. We needed not to seek for a stream or a spring, for in a very few minutes the
            depressions in the plain around our camp furnished an ample supply, both for man and
            beast. We made 18 miles to-day, over an excellent road. The country around is of a most
            desolate character. August lUh. Six miles from camp brought us to a liill, on which was
            a smooth rock covering about half an acre, to the right of the road. In this rock I
            count- ed twenty-six artificial cavities within a few feet of each other. They were from
            twelve to eighteen inches deep, and about six in diameter ; and had been dug out by the
            Indians for mortars in which to pound their maize. The place was thickly covered with
            various kinds of cacti as well as the agave and yucca. The •common prickly pear abounded
            with its luscious look- « TO EL PASO. 371 but unwholesome fruit, of which our men

            high, we had a fine view of the vast plain around us, stretching in every direction as
            far as the eye could reach, and unlimited by any continuous range of mountains. Short
            isolated ridges rose up at intervals of from ten to twenty miles, and between them the
            conical hills before referred to. Immediate- ly below, about a mile distant, was the
            Salado, or Salt Lake, from two to four miles across ; although after rams it is
            doubtless much larger. Some ten or fifteen miles to the north-west, I noticed what
            appeared to be another small lake, which may have been the Laguna de Santa Maria.
            Although from its whitish appear- ance, it may have been but the salt bed of a dry
            lake.f I took a sketch of the country here, with a curious cone- shaped hill in the
            foreground, on the summit of which IS a mass of rocks resembling a tower. Similarly
            crown- ed hills were seen during the day's march. We made a noon halt at some pools of
            fresh water near the Salado ; as it was my intention to go as far as possible io-day, so

            produced by a too free use of it. t In my former journeys, we frequently saw these
            playas, or dry 'ates ; and even when within a quarter of a mile, it was utterly impos-

            it rather uncom- fortable, as it rained most of the time; yet I made my hourly rounds,

            sun on the white sand, the crossing was never attempted except at night 'We were now
            favored by the rain ; and it was thought best, notwithstanding our day's march, to. make
            the passage of the hills this night ; the weather would be cooler and the sand more
            compact from the ram. The place where we stopped was about two miles from the sand
            hills.- We accordingly dined, and let the animals feed, and at 7 o'clock, p. m., resumed
            our march. Upon consultation, it was thought best for Leroux to leave a couple of hours
            in advance of the wagons with the train of pack-mules, and go as far as Samalayuca a
            spring two miles beyond the hills, in case he could not find water nearer. He was then
            to discharge his loads and return to the wagons, to give us such aid as might be
            necessary. The first three miles were not very bad ; for thougli the sand was loose, it
            was not deep ; still it was a steady pull up a gradual ascent. As we proceeded, the sand
            grew deeper, and the vegetation less, until nothing but a few half-buried mezquit bushes
            were to fe seen. An aromatic shrub was also noticed here. At a great depth there is
            probably some moisture vliich sustains these plants ; but even with this, it is
            I'emarkable how they can survive in the midst of such intense and dry heat, in a spot
            where, for more than nine months in tlie year, tbere is no rain. Every thing around us
            had a strange wintry aspect, the white sand iesembling banks of snow, from which the
            tops of the an » I 374 COREELITOS buslies projected. At nine o'clock, Leroux returned to
            us with tlie pack-mules, when we stopped and unloaded the wagons, to transfer their
            contents to the animals' backs. It was now raining fast ; and as the mules had had a
            tedious march over the sanTi hills and back, Leroux thought it best to remain where he
            was until • day -light, while we pushed forward with the wagons, now almost empty.
            Slowly and with hard tugging, we again advanced, but not noiselessly ; for the incessant
            hooting and yell- ing of the teamsters, accompanied by the cracking of their huge whips,
            and not a few of those terrible oaths which they seem to consider it their privilege to
            use, made the air resound in the midst of the solitude that reigned around us. At every
            fifty feet it was neces- sary to stop, and let the tired animals breathe and get a
            moment's rest ; then would the air resound agam with the screams of the men and the
            lashing of the whips ; then was every shoulder literally put to the wheels and the back
            parts of the wagons, before they could again be started. But with all this pulling and
            pushing, this hard swearing and beating, the poor jaded animals often stalled, and could
            not, with all the aid the men could give them, start the wagons an inch. The team was
            then doubled; and when the twelve mules had succeeded in hauling the wagon up some
            little rise, the descent would prove a great relief, and enable them to get forward a
            few rods unaided. The reader will have an idea of the sand here, when I state that the
            hub of the fore wheel was only the breadth of my hand above its surface. This too, was
            with wagons not half filled, and at a time when TO EL PASO. 375 tlie hills are easier to
            pass than at any other, on account of the rain, which packs the sand, and prevents tlie
            wheels from sinking as deep as they would if it was entirely dry. In this manner we
            pushed and pulled, making a gradual though slow headway, until one o'clock, when the
            mules refused to go further. The poor creatures held their noses to the ground, and
            patiently bore the beating of their cruel drivers. It was all to no pur- pose ; further
            they would not go. In the five hours we had been tugging, we had not made more than four
            miles through the hills, and there were yet about two miles more before we should get
            through. There was no alternative left but to remain until morning, by which time the
            animals would get a few hours' rest. As my carratella (little wagon) was quite light,
            and my mules in good condition, T pushed forward, going jnyself on foot, and before four
            o'clock in the morning passed the hills, and reached the place where Mr. Ieroux had
            stopped with the packs. Several of the wagons also managed to get through, leaving only
            three behind. This had been one of the most tedious nights of our long journey . I was
            on my feet from 7 o'clock la the evening, when we entered the sand-hills, till lour in
            the momino:, makins: nine hours, in which time we advanced but eight miles. It rained
            the whole ight ; yet such was my fatigue, that several times, when the mules stopped to
            rest, or became stalled, I threw myself on the wet sand and stole a few moments' sleep.
            On reaching camp, I sent back six mules, which, f 376 CORRELITOS _ J with those left
            with 'the wagons, enabled them all to get through a few hours later. ' We did not go on
            to the spring talked of, which was two miles further, but stopped at some holes of rain
            water immediately at the foot of the hills. The' Medanos or Sand-hills, are a peculiar
            feature in this country, stretching in a line from north-west to south-east for some
            twenty miles," as far as I could judge. Nearly destitute of vegetation, their light yel-
            low or whitish appearance presents a strong contrast to the deep brown of the adjacent
            mountains, which form the bactground of the landscape. This sand is very light and fine,
            and forms deep ridges resembling the large waves of the ocean. When the wind blows, this
            sand is set in motion, filling up the former valleys, and forming new drifts or hills.
            The road is then entirely obliterated ; not a foot-print or wagon rut being left to show
            its direction. The whitened bones of mules and cattle project here and there from the
            sand, with an occasional carcass which has dried up before the wolves discovered it.
            Although these hills lie on the direct road from El Paso to the city of Chi- huahua,

            These take the river route, which passes entirely beyond their furthest southern
            extremity. Persons on horseback, pack-mules, . and light pleasure wagons, alone attempt
            to cross the hills. The place is also attended with danger on account of the Apaches,
            who well know the helpless condition of animals passing, and take the opportunity to
            attacii parties. From Correlitos, there is no other to El Paao TO EL PASO. 377 r for
            wagons ; and a train loaded with corn from the Casas Grandes valley, was attacked here a
            year before by these savages, and all the mules driven off. The distance travelled the
            last twenty-four hours from beyond the Salado was twenty-eight miles, including the
            passage of the i/?(7awo5. August IGth. All, both men and animals, were so much exhausted
            with fatigue, that we were compelled to lie by to-day. In the afternoon, we had the
            usual show rer. August 11th. Two miles brought us to the spring known as Samalayuca. It
            is a complete oasis in the desert, and consists of a small pool of water, in and around
            which are bushes and trees. It seems to be placed here by nature, for the weary and
            thirsty trav- eller, by whom the route would else be impassable. On the west there is
            not usually any water nearer than the Salado, thirty miles distant, which is also the
            dis- tance of El Paso, the nearest point to the north. East- ward is San Eleazario,
            twenty miles. The rain of yesterday had made the road so heavy/ that I feared we should
            not reach El Paso as I wished, ut a few hours' heat of the sun so improved its con-
            dition, that I determined to push on in advance of the tram ; and as we were hear our
            journey's end for the present, I did not hesitate to force my mules to their utmost. We
            ascended gradually from the spring for ahout ten miles, when we reached the level
            plateau, which was as smooth and barren as any desert we had seen. About ten miles from
            El Paso, the road descends from the highest table to a lower terrace, and for five iles
            continues over broken ground with low hills and 378 CORRELITOS gullies, when it strikes
            the bottom-land of the Rio Grande. The sight of the rich valley of this river, with its
            groves and forests of cotton-wood, filled my mind with the most pleasing emotions. I was
            again approaching civilization, at a place too where I had passed an agreeable winter,
            and where I had many kind friends. This long journey from the Pacific, which had
            occupied us for eighty-one days, was now at an end, and we should have a little rest.
            Soon the cultivated fields and the vineyards opened before us, and at 6 o'clock we again
            entered the town of El Paso del Norte. The first familiar faces we met were those of
            Captain Jimenes and some of the other officers of the Mexican Commission. From them we
            learned that Lieutenant Wilkins, the commanding officer of the U. S. troops at El Paso,
            and Mr. Henry Jacobs, the disburs- ing officer of the U. S. Commission, with a small
            file of troops, had been out several miles to meet us, and had just returned. They had
            heard of our approach by a messenger whom I despatched two days before. After feome
            delays in fording the Rio Grande, I reached my old quarters at Magoffinsville, opposite
            the town, at 10 o'clock, p. M. August IStk The remainder of the party were unable to get
            through last nijht, and came in this mornmg. o Of this journey, now concluded, which
            embraced about eleven hundred miles, about one half was per- formed while the
            thermometer ranged above 100 during the day, and the other half when there -vvas
            scarcely a day without a heavy rain. To Lieutenant Whipple, the chief engineer and

            successful accomplishment under such privations, and hardships, together with so many
            and such serious diflficulties. As regards the health of the party on this journey from
            California, it was generally good. A few cases of scurvy occurred among the escort ; and
            during the last two weeks before reaching El Paso, many began to be afflicted with
            rheumatism, and fever and ague, from their constant exposure for thirty-four days to
            rains, ihere were also some cases of bowel complaints from time to time ; but all
            readily yielded to medicine. One most painful casualty it was our lot to meet with, in
            the death of the excellent officer and friend who com- manded our escort, Colonel Lewis

            Surveyor f the Commission, advising me of the progress made n that portion of the lina
            Two parties had been tively engaged in the work ; and Major E. believed the survey would
            be completed as far as Loredo by 382 INCIDENTS AT October, and the whole line to the
            month of the river by the 4th of March, 1853, if no unforeseen obstacle was placed in
            the way. There yet remained to be completed that portion of the line on the parallel of
            32° 22' north latitude, which was to extend west three degrees from the Rio Grande, and
            thence north to the Gila. Of this line Lieutenant Whipple, while acting as chief
            astronomer, had surveyed and laid down with great minuteness about one half, and had
            also determined and marked its western termination. I now directed the same r oflQcer to
            organize a party, and as soon as the train could be got ready to take the field again,
            to resume and com- plete the survey of the line referred to, in the same manner in which
            he had begun it. The next step was to prepare for the return of my- self and party, to
            rejoin Major Emory at Eagle Pass (Fort Duncan). More wagons had to be procured for
            Lieutenant Whipple* as well as for myself; and all those that had come through from
            California required more or less repairs. The harness, tents, and camp equi- page too
            required a thorough overhauling ; as the con- tinued wet weather and constant marching
            had told severely on every thing. I was so fortunate as to find mechanics here, who were
            at once employed and set to work. In the mean time the mules had to be brought to a
            condition fit to undertake as long a jour- ney as that they had just completed. They
            were, therefore, given rations of corn and sent to the moun- tain near, where there was
            grama grass in abundance. But they had become so thin, that many weeks would be
            necessary, under the best care, to bring them up. I I t * EL PASO DEL NORTE. 383 I was
            sorry to find on my arrival, that the • military post, which was here when I left the
            year before, had been broken up and the troops withdrawn, with the exception only of a
            small detachment under Lieutenant Wilkins, which was quartered at Mr. Magoffin's rancho,
            m the same building where I was. To the regret of all the inhabitants, even this small
            force was withdrawn a few weeks after.* Military Post, El Paso. The town of El Paso del
            Norte, so frequently alluded to, is on the lexican side of the river. Ou the American
            side there was no settle- "lent until after the war, and the rich bottoms were but

            The Apaclies had' been more bold than usual dur- ing the spring and summer of 1852 ; and
            the whole frontier had suffered from their inroads. Man} men had been killed within a
            few miles of El Paso ; and af the astronomical observatory, at Frontera, eight miles
            distant, a man was pierced with arrows while herding the animals within a few rods of
            the house. Mr. Magof- fin's corral had been several times entered, and his mules stolen
            ; and many other citizens there had been sufferers. On two occasions, while I remained
            at Magof- finsville, the Indians made attempts to run off the animals of the Commission,
            but were frustrated, by being discovered in time to prevent the stampede. No one could
            venture alone, with safety, three miles from the settlement, and when I went to take a
            ride, if it was extended as far as three miles, I felt it neces- sary to be accompanied
            by several friends. Such was the state of the Mexican frontier in 1852. As the question
            has been repeatedly asked, What is to be done with the large tribes of Indians on the
            Mexican frontier ? and as there is still a diversity of opinion on the subject, I shall
            take the present occa- sion to make a few suggestions, based upon what I settlement, and
            represents the American El Paso. It consists of a large square, around whicli are
            substantial adobe buildings of a bettter de- scription than usual, embracing some six or
            eight large stores and ware- houses, well filled with merchandise. This town is
            admirably situated, and belongs wholly to James W. Magoffin, Esq., an American, long
            resident in Mexico, whose energy and public spirit will undoubteclly make it the
            principal place on the frontier. Its position, as astronomi- West Whippl Distance the

            from personal observation, and mj inter- course with the Indians. It is known that we
            already have along this fron- tier, but chiefly in the State of Texas and the territory
            of New Mexico, a large military force, embracing full two-thirds of the army, which is
            supported at an enor- mous expense. Military posts have been established at various
            points on the Rio Grande, and in the very heart of the Indian country, in Texas, and
            New- Mexico. Yet two of the largest and most widely spread tribes, the Comanches and the
            Apaches, are as actively hostile to the Americans and the Mexicans as they were before
            the country occupied by them, be- came a part of the Union. At no period have the
            incursions been more frequent, or attended with greater atrocities, than at the present
            time. The Comanches pass across the Rio Grande into Mexico, in bands of 300 or 400, and
            penetrate the very heart of Chihuahua ; they have passed into Durango and Zacatecas, and
            have traversed Coahuila and Nueva Leon. The extent of the 'lepredations and murders
            committed by them would be appalling, if summed up.* Yet the system flourishes in full
            vigor, notwithstanding the efi'orts made to sup- press it on the part of the United
            States, in compliance Jith the solemn stipulations of the Treaty with Mexico. The
            depredations of the Apaches are less serious, 0% because their numbers are less, and
            they have a ore thinly settled country for their operations. In Some idea of the extent

            northern portions of the States of Sonora and Chihuahua. These regions, once inhabited
            by a peaceful and happy population, are now deserted, and the fertile valleys they
            tilled are reverting to the condition of a wilderness. The numbers of both these tribes
            have been, in my opinion, much overrated. That of the Comauches, from the most reliable
            information I could obtain, falls short of 12,000. Their range is from the Mexican
            States alluded to, to the Buffalo region, north and east of Santa Fe. In the fall and
            winter season their home is near the E,io Grande, in the Bolson de Ma]gim% a vast basin
            shut in by high mountains at the west. Here they enjoy uninterrupted possession of a
            wide extent of country, whence they make their sallies into the heart of Mexico. The
            Apaches, whose number does not exceed 5000,* extend from the vicinity of the Pecos
            through the States of Chihuahua, Sonora, 1846, to the 1st of October, 1850, as taken Ly

            the number of Indians in a tribe, unless tbey are actually counted. This is endenl from
            the varying reports of different agents and travellers, lu the tables of tlie Indian
            population of the United States, in Mr. Schoolcraft's great EL PASO DEL NORTE. 387 i-
            and the territory of New Mexico, to tlie confines of the Colorado of the West. Thej are
            less nomadic m their habits than the Comanches, and have districts in which their
            families permanently reside. This tribe, from the time they are first mentioned by
            Father Kino, in the year 1694, have been a nation of robbers. Their hand is against
            every other tribe, and that of all others against them. It was they who drove out the
            peaceable people and semi-civilized tribes from the Gila, and destroyed the builders of
            the ancient edifices we have spoken of. Every account we have represents them as a
            treacherous and blood- thirsty people, living by plunder alone. They have made repeated
            treaties with the States of Sonora and Chihuahua, only to be broken on the first
            favorable opportunity ; and the treaties recently made with the United States have been
            as little regarded. I proposed to the principal chiefs that they should abandon
            cattle-stealing, and cultivate the ground; telling them if they would do so, the U. S.
            government would instruct and protect them, giving them blankets and clothing besides.
            The old chiefs said they could ot adopt this new fashion, although the boys and '"ort,
            the Comanches are variously set down, from the year 1846 to I80O, at from 12,000 to
            20,000. The Apaches embrace so many band?, and are so widely scattered, that it is
            extremely difficult to enumerate them. - f r. Schoolcraft, from the latest authorities,
            puts the Apache bands in Texas at 3500 in New Mexico at 6000, and in the unexplored
            parts north of tne Gila at 2000, mating altogether 11,500; whicji I think too high. It
            is unusual to find 200 of them together; and throughout the States of Sonora and
            Chihuahua, I heard of the same chiefs that we met and With whom we kept up so long an
            intercourse at the Copper Mines, and *to were, of course, accompanied by the same bands.
            ' 388 INCIDENTS AT young men might do so. They said tliey would not rob or murder the
            Americans, but could not be brought to promise the same with regard to the Mexicans.
            What, then, is absolutely necessary, for the sake of these Indians themselves as well as
            of our frontier population, is to convince them of the overwhelming superiority of force
            on our side ; and to show them that, if they wish to escape utter extermination, they
            must lay aside their predatory habits, and learn to live by the labor of their own
            hands. To effect this, a change should be made in the system pursued at the frontier
            posts. Soldiers should go into quarters, and then quietly remain devot o themselves to
            agriculture. Better would it be for the government to pay double the price it now does
            for its wheat and corn, than to employ the soldiers m cultivating it; for the
            consequence of the present system is, that by their attending to the fields, they become
            unfitted for and neglect their proper duty as soldiers. I would suggest, that with the
            opening of the spring, the soldiers should leave their quarters, and be kept moving from
            one point to another. Let them be a few days in a mountain pass, next at some oasis in
            the desert whither the savage must resort to satisfy his parching thirst, and again in
            some of those beautiful valleys covered with luxuriant grass, which are also his resort
            after his predatory excursions, that he may recruit his animals. This active life would
            be much more agreeable and healthy for the men than the inactivity of a garrison, and
            would tend more to overawe and subdue the Indians. EL PASO DEL NORTE. 389 A difficulty
            arises when the Indians, on being pursued, take refuge in Mexico, where our troops
            cannot follow them. Some arrangement should be entered into by which small bodies of U.
            S. soldiers may be permitted, on such occasions, to enter Mexican territory within
            prescribed limits. This plan would he agreeable to the Mexican authorities, as they
            informed me. I have no doubt that much might yet be accom- plished by sending suitable
            agents among the Indians ; men who are at heart philanthropists, and who will ear-
            nestly engage in the work of ameliorating their condi- tion. Much good could be done,
            too, by sending mechanics among them, particularly carpenters and blacksmiths, also a
            supply of implements of husbandry. -Most of the tribes beyond the Rio Grande are more or

            Comanches into the same condition. The pursuit most immediately adapted to tneir nature
            and habits would be the raising of cattle and mules ; a business which they could most

            is a pernicious one, and can have but one result : it will stimulate their fondness for
            war, and render necessary an armed and an annihilating protection to our citizens.
            Besides this, there is but little game in that country, and the arable lands could not
            support such numbers as would be brought into it if the plan should be carried out. •
            The only excursion I was able to make, while waiting for the train to be got ready, was
            to Fort Fillmore. Towards the close of September, Colonel Xangberg of the Mexican army,
            and military inspector of the frontier, proposed to me to visit Colonel Miles,
            cpmmanding at that Fort ; I gladly took advantage of the opportunity. On the day
            appointed I took my carriage, and, accompanied by Colonel Langberg, Dr. Webb, Mr. H.
            Jacobs, and ten dragoons, set off for Fort Fillmore, about 45 miles distant from El Paso
            ; which we reach- ed at sunset, and where we were politely received by Colonel Miles and
            the officers with him. This Fort was established in 1851, when the military posts at
            Dona Ana and El Paso were aban- doned ; as it was thought that its position was better
            than either of those, and that it would be sufficient for this frontier. It contained at
            the time of our visit about two hundred soldiers, infantry and dragoons, under the
            command of Colonel Miles of the 3d Infantry. It occupied a commanding position above the
            bottom-lands ; whence the valley of the Kio Grande can be seen for many miles. Nearly
            opposite is the town of Mesilla: and extending above and r EL PASO DEL NORTE. 391 below
            it, is tHat portion of tlie bottom-lands known as the Mesilla Valley," wliicli is now
            occupying the public attention, as connected with the boundary dis- * Mesilla is the
            derivative of the Spanish mesa table; and, as here applied, means a small plateau, or
            table-land, to distinguish it from the great table-land which extends for many hundred
            miles on both sides of the Rio Grande, and which is not susceptible of cultivation. It
            was without an inhabitant until the year 1850. At the close of the war with Mexico, the
            majority of the inhabitants of Dona Ana determined to leave that place, in consequence
            of the encroachments of the Americans, who endeavoured to despoil them of their
            property. AVhether the Mexican occupants of the town and lands adjacent were the lawful
            owners or not, it is needless to inquire.; it is sufficient to say that they had long
            been in undistnrbed possejsion. ; With this resolution, a spot was selected on the
            opposite or western side of the river, eight or ten miles below Dona Ana, which, it was
            believed, would be within the limits of Mexico. In the month of May, 1850, this people
            established themselves there, and named- the place "La Mesilla." To increase the colony,
            the government of Mexico offered to give lands to other actual settlers; which offer
            induced large numbers of dissatisfied Mexicans h\dng in New Mexico and in the small
            settlements along the Eio Grande, in Texas, to remove thither. More than half the
            population of Dona Ana removed to Mesilla within a year. When the boundary line was
            agreed upon, in December, 1850, and It became certain that La Mesilla was south of it,
            the fears they had pm to entertain were removed, and a day was set apart for- public re-
            joicing. After this, the population increased much on account of the. inducements
            offered; and in October, 1852, the Prefect of El Paso stated that it numbered 1,900
            souls. "Very few Americans settled there — in fact, noiie but traders ; and it Probable
            there never were twenty altogether. Last summer (1853) some speculators attempted the
            same imposi- tions as were practised when they were- citizens of New Mexico, by claiming
            their lands. This created such dissatisfaction, that they threat- ened to leave, and
            again become citizens of the United States. At this 4i * ■ A » •X 392 INCIDENTS AT 4
            pute. The town of Cruces is about three, and Doiia Arra about eleven miles further up
            the valley. The bottom- lands are exceedingly fertile on both banks of the river ', and
            I am not aware that they are better situ- ated or more productive on one bank than on
            the other. The barracks at Fort Fillmore are as yet quite rude, being mere jackals that
            is, built of upright sticks filled in with mud. They were hastily put up ; but it is the
            intention of Colonel Miles to have more substantial buildings of adobe erected
            forthwith. There is no better material in this country for buildings than this. I took
            the opportunity while at Fort Fillmore to visit a silver mine, which had been discovered
            a few months previous, and which was now being worked by its owner, Hugh Stevenson,
            Esq., of El Paso. The mine is situated in the Organ Mountains, about eighteen miles east
            of the Fort ; and as these mountains are the haunts of the Apaches, Colonel Miles kindly
            furnished us with an escort of ten dragoons, commanded by Major Steen, an oflEicer
            familiar with this region, and expe- rienced in Indian campaigns. By taking an early
            start we reached the nearest point in the mountains, about twelve miles distant, before
            10 o'clock, having traversed a desert plain with a gradual ascent the whole way. On
            reaching a defile which leads across the ridge. Major Steen and Dr. Webb took a portion
            of the dragoons and went to the time some mischievous persons put the idea into their
            heads of saving their property bj denying the jurisdiction of Mexico ; and this is
            doubt- less the foundation of the statement that they desire to be annexed to the United
            States. ■ ; II "■a m *i f i i I J M o U V O 2: a ■ 5 ■ x: I -i EL PASO DEL NORTE 393 i.
            £ I t 1 i' about five miles farther to the north I remained with the defil I then took
            my rifle, and walked a couple of miles through it and the deep gorges which indent the
            ridge. In this ramble I passed a beautiful little stream, which, rising far within the
            defile, wound its way along through Oraa Wountain?. any intricacies, where it had worn
            for itself a deep ed, until it tumbled over the rocks in a single fall of some fifty
            feet. Although the quantity of water was small, the fall was exceedingly picturesque.
            When far P in this mountain, whither I was led with some of 394 INCIDENTS AT the
            dragoons in pursuit of a deer, we saw fresh Indian tracks ; and not knowing but an arrow
            or a lance mierht be thrown at us from behind some rock or bush, we thought it best to
            return. The "Sierra de los Organos," or Organ Mountains, are so named from their
            pinnacled summits and sides, which resemble the pipes of an organ. They are of a light
            gray granite, and rise to the height of 3000 feet above the river. The range runs north
            and south, and joins the El Paso Mountains, not far from the town of that name. The
            defiles are filled with large pines, and the more open valley, with live-oaks. Pine
            timber is here cut and drawn by mules to where it can be reached with wagons. From the
            place where we halted and lunched, I took a sketch of these mountains and of the defile
            through which I had passed. A small stream flowed near us, marked by a line of fine
            large oaks. Midway between this spot and the mountains rises a bold mass of white
            granite. Iq the afternoon Major Steen and Dr. Webb returned from the silver mine,*
            bringing specimens of the ore. We then harnessed and saddled up for our return to the
            Fort, which we reached at nine o'clock. We passed a few days very agreeably at Fort
            Fill- more, partaking of the hospitalities of Colonel Miles and his officers. This
            visit, too, was rendered doubly agreeable, by the society of four American ladies, be-
            longing to the families of the officers, who had had the courage to accompany the army
            on its toilsome marcn of three months across the plains. These were the only American
            ladies I had met between San Antonio 4 EL PASO DEL XORTE. 395 and the Pacific coast, and
            were, I believe, the only ones on this portion of the frontier. On our return we made a
            noon halt on the banks of the river, near the spot where the gallant Doniphan won his
            first laurels, the battle-field of Bracito. Al- though this place is laid down on the
            maps, there is no town nor even a single habitation to mark the spot. The battle was
            fought on an open plain, the very last place one would expect the Mexicans to choose for
            meeting an invading army, unless confident, as it ap- pears they were, of overwhelming
            them at once. Had the Mexicans taken a stand in the mountain pass, they might have given
            some trouble ; but even then they could only have retarded a little the progress of the
            con- querors.* * I quote from Colonel Doniphan's despatch a brief account of this •
            affair:—" On the 23d of March, we commenced our march from Dona Ana; and on the 25th,
            our advance of 500 men had halted for the pur- pose of camping, ahout three o'clock. Our
            men were engaged in getting wood and water, when our advanced guard informed us the
            enemy was rapidly advancing at a short distance. The rear, under Colonel Jackson, was
            several miles behind ; the rally was immediately sounded, and our lorces formed in open
            order on foot as skirmishers. The enemy halted *t half a mile, and formed in line of
            battle. Before we had fullv formed, they sent /«y that the commander of our forces
            should go to their lines and confer with their commander; declaring, at the same time,
            unless it was complied with, they would charge and take him and neither ask nor give
            quartm\ ihe reply was more abrupt than decorous — 'To charge, and be d — d.' At the
            return of the hlach flag, the enemy commenced his charge, and opened a fire on us from
            right to left, at about 400 yards. Our forces ere ordered to receive their fire without
            returning it, until it could prove effective. Three rounds were fired by the whole line,
            before they had vanced within rifle shot. I then ordered their fire to be returned. This
            396 INCIDENTS AT It had been my intention, wlien leaving El Paso, to take the San
            Antonio road as far as the Leona station, about six hundred miles, and there turn off to
            Eagle Pass, where I expected to meet Major Emory; and for this journey all my
            arrangements were made. The military escort was alone wanting, and this was one object
            of my visit to Fort Fillmore, where a portion of the company originally detailed for the
            purpose were waiting orders. Much to my disappointment I found there but twenty-four
            effective men belonging to the company, a number barely sufficient for an escort for
            Lieutenant Whipple. In this position, I was at a loss what course to take, or how to get
            out of the country. Every small party coming through from San Antonio had been attacked
            by the Comanches; and accounts had reached El Paso .that bands of three hundred warriors
            had been seen. At no time had there been so much alarm felt ; and I was advised, by the
            army officers and others, who knew the state of the country, not to attempt the jour-
            ney, with so small a party as mine, without an escort. The officers and men of the
            Commission, myself includ- ed, had performed guard duty from the Pimo villages to El
            Paso ; and we did not feel disposed to do it again on the long march to Eagle Pass. At
            this juncture was done from right to left, along the whole line simultaneously, which
            completely checked their advance, and threw them iTito great disorder. A charge was now
            madb, when the enemy fled to the mountains con- tiguous. The force of the enemy was
            1220, of which 537 were caval- ry. * * * The loss of the enemy was 43 killed, and 150
            reported at El Paso to be wounded. Our loss was none killed— 7 wounded ; a" since
            recovered." 1r EL PASO DEL NORTE. 397 Colonel Langberg kindly tendered me an escort of
            Mexican soldiers, in case I would take the route by the city of Chihuahua, and thence
            through the States of Durango, Coahuila, Nueva Leon, and Tamaulipas, to such point as I
            wished to reach on the Lower Rio Grande. This offer, after due consideration, I accept-
            ed, and advised Major Emory of my decision, request- ing him to meet me at a point lower
            down the river than Eagle Pass, which would probably be Comargo. About this time the
            mail party from San Antonio arrived. They had been attacked and surrounded by a large
            body of Indians ; but had kept their assailants at bay for several days, by entrenching
            themselves behind some rocks. This party consisted of men cele- brated as Indian
            fighters, and was commanded by Mr. Wallace, one of the most intrepid and experienced
            roen on the frontier. Every Indian who exposed him- self was instantly brought down by a
            shot from the unerring rifle, until they were actually driven from the field. Mr.
            Wallace returned to San Antonio, procured a new outfit, and strengthened his party ; he
            then set oat again, and came through with the mail in safety. - During my stay here, one
            of those events took place hich are not unusual on the Mexican frontier, and 'hich
            sometimes produce a rupture between the Mexi- can government and its people. It is known
            that the duty of sixty per cent, imposed by Mexico on many articles of merchandise,
            amounts to a prohibition. Yet, owing to the laxity of the custom- house officials, the
            law has been evaded, and eroods regularly admitted Each lnows that if he exacts the
            legal duty, either the 398 INCIDENTS AT merchandise will be smuggled in, or some
            brother-col- lector, less conscientious and more anxious to pocket the fees, will be
            ready to compound for a smaller sum. It accordingly became the practice to admit trains
            of merchandise for the interior of Mexico by paying five hundred dollars on each wagon
            load. This free and easy way of doing business had certainly the advantage of saving
            clerk hire, as well as removing the necessity of examining invoices, and all contention
            as to the cost or value of goods. A leading merchant of the city of Chihuahua, who for
            some reason had become inimical to the govern- ment, had a train of some sixty or
            seventy wagons and carts filled with goods, on its way from San Antonio to that city, by
            the way of the Presidio del Norte. The authorities, being informed of the approach of
            the train were determined that 'it should not pass without a thorough examination and
            payment of the full duties; to insure which, a military force was sent to the cross- ing
            place. In consequence of this unlooked-for obsta- cle, the whole train came up to El
            Paso, about two hun- dred miles out of its way, for the purpose of enterin here ; but
            the military force, which was under the command of Colonel Langberg, was ordered hither
            also, to prevent the entry of the goods except at the full duty. J cr The collector of
            El Paso was disposed to pass the goods after the usual convenient fashion, in which he
            was supported by the merchants and municipal authorities of the place ; while Colonel
            Langberg, act- ing under orders from the capital, was determined that they should not,
            and declared his intention to arrest and imprison the collector, Don Alejo Garcia Conde,
            - I EL PASO DEL NOETE. 399 if he did not strictly enforce tlie legal duties. The
            collector armed himself and his partj, and the train prepared to cross and fight their
            way through. As might be supposed, there was great excitement, and it was feared blood
            would be shed ; but the affair passed off quietly. The train crossed the river, each
            teamster armed with a whip and rifle ; and to avoid a conflict, Colonel Langberg sent an
            armed guard with the train to Chihuahua, which was followed by the collector, to settle
            the difficulty there. On the 1st of October, Lieutenant Whipple took his departure, to

            All being in readiness to start, the train drew up in front of Mr. Magoffin's
            store-housej to take in a supply of corn. While standing here, the mules, which had not
            been in harness for six weeks or more, became uneasy, and, turning suddenly round, woke
            off two of the wagon tongues ; which compelled s to wait another day for repairs. There
            is no grass along the river after' leaving ta. This made it necessary to send off a

            now arrived when I was to take leave of my friends at El Paso. Friends at home, where we
            have numbers, are not always valued as they should be ; but in a country like this, on
            the borders of civilization, one knows how to appre- ciate them. I had now been here
            seven weeks, and •during the winter of 1850-51, five months, while wait- the arrival of
            the chief astronomer. With many gentlemen here, particularly J. W. Magoffin, Esq., I had
            transacted business to a large extent, and in a manner which to me, as an agent of the
            government, was highly satisfactory. To them I take this occasion to express my sincere
            thanks for the promptness with which they fulfilled my orders, often to their own
            inconvenience, and for their uniform readiness in accept- ing my drafts upon the
            government, when a contrary course would have been detrimental to the public ser- vice,
            and would have subjected me personally to serious embarrassments. On the occasion of our
            departure, Mr. Magoffin invited a number of gentlemen to partake of a cold collation,
            which proved to be one that would have done credit to the caterer of a metropolitan
            hotel. Although it k difficult at times to procure a piece of fresh meat at El Paso, the
            delicacies prepared in New York and Paris for foreign markets can always be found liere
            in abundance, though at a high cost. I left at one o'clock, and in the evening joined

            march. The train consisted of my travelling carriage, a very convenient vehicle, which
            was to form my sleeping-place during the journey; the small wagon I brought from
            California, in which lr. "Webb rode; and six other wagons containing our provisions,
            baggage, tents, camp equipage, instruments, etc. AH the party were mounted on horses or
            mules, and well armed ; and for a change I had also provided myself with a riding mule.
            We got off at noon and Diade fourteen miles, encamping near a pool of water. Our route,
            most of the way, was along the Eio Grande, under rich bottom, of which only a small

            descending and ascending the steep banks, as well as in crossing tlie river, I hired a
            Mexican to take a note back to Mr. Thurber, who was with the train, advising him to send
            men for- ward with spades and pickaxes,, to cut down the banks before the wagons should
            attempt to pass. ' I then rode on to Guadalupe, three miles ahead, for the purpose of
            procuring sheep, as well as to notify ftie Mexican escort, who were to join us here, of
            the approach of the train Colonel Langberg had promised me ten men, if I could wait a
            few days for their return from Chihuahua ; but this I could not do, and was therefore
            obliged to take up with five, as but few now remained in the garrison. These men soon
            reported themselves. After procuring the sheep, and while we were quietly waiting for
            the train to come up, a messenger arrived with the disagreeable news that the ambulance
            which contained the personal baggage of Dr. ebb, Mr. Jacobs, and myself, had been upset
            in crossmg the river, and that every thing had been immersed in the water. I hastened
            back to the scene of the disaster, and found things worse than I had expected. Besides
            our baggage, a trunk filled with papers, maps, my account books, and the official
            records of the Joint, Commission, had been wet. Some choice stationery was utterly
            ruined. We at once set to work, and spread every thing out on the patches of grass that
            were near and on the branches of trees ; but althouoh the sun was hot, there was not
            sufficient time to dry all before night. October 11th. The forenoon was spent in drymg

            again hitched up, and we moved off * once more, passing through Guadalupe, and stopped
            at a small lagoon, three miles beyond, where we encamped. We could have travelled a
            couple ofhours longer, but were told there was no water within fifteen miles, which we
            could not make before dark, as a portion of the road was very sandy. Guadalupe is a

            were necessary. During the day the heat is quite oppressive, so that the thinnest
            clothing is required ; but no sooner docs the sun sink below the horizon, than the
            temperature falls to a degree that compels one to change one's garments and rap up well
            in blankets! The mornings are equally cold, until the sun has been up at least three
            hours. % ten or eleven thick clothing is laid aside. We left the valley of the Rio
            Grande to-day, and ascended the table-land, which was thinly covered with chapporal
            without grass. The road was sandy ; i 406 EL PASO yet we made fifteen miles, and
            encamped at Cantarecio, where there is a spring of good water. October 13th. Our course
            was to-day south-west towards the direct route from El Paso to Chihuahua ; and with the
            exception of a few places, the road was good. Mezquit grass occurred at intervals
            sufficient for grazing. No trees were seen, and scarcely any shrubbery ; so that our
            cooks with difficulty procured enough to prepare our food. "We made twenty-five miles
            (at least so it was called by the Mexicans), and encamped at Gliarco de Grado. The
            Mexican mode of measurement is very uncertain, unless practised by engineers. The water
            here is found in small pools, supplied by springs ; but so meagre is the supply, that I
            doubt whether it can be depended upon in the dry season. w October lUh. Our course
            continued the same as yesterday, over a broad plain, unlimited by mountams, which showed
            themselves only at intervals of from ten to twenty miles in short ridges, their summits
            present- ing a jagged and fantastic appearance. Turrets and cupolas, huge towers and
            castles, alternately were seen. These mountains appeared to be destitute of vegetation,
            except the grama grass, which grows on the debris from the base to the point where the
            bare rocks arise. Fifteen miles brought us to the Ojo de Lucero (Venus's Spring), which
            furnishes but a small supply of water. We did not stop here, but pushed on to the Laguna
            de los Patos (Duck Lake), six miles further, and encamped near a spot where a stream of
            clear and delicious water crosses the road. This rivulet comes from a spring near by,
            and empties into a smal TO CHIHUAHUA. 407 'I: \ pond containing a couple of acres, in
            which many ducks were seen. Two miles before encamping, we entered the direct road from
            El Paso to Chihualiua. This road crosses the Medanos or Sand-hills, which we passed on
            our road from Correlitos to El Paso ; and such were the difficulties then presented,
            that I determined not to attempt it again with wagons. Our route bj Gua- dalupe required
            two days longer than if we had crossed the Sand-hills ; but it was better to lose two
            days than to disable or break down our animals at the outset of a long journey. The
            Laguna de los Patos is the outlet of the river Carmen ; and is four or five miles
            across, varying in extent according to the rainy season. The body of water on our right
            was doubtless the effect of the late heavy rains ; while that on the left, which is
            properly the laguna, is permanent. A mile before reaching the lake is a small hill some
            twenty feet high, on the top of which is a warm spring. In the plain on our right, which
            was more or less covered with water, at a distance of eight or ten miles, I had noticed
            during the day what I supposed to be clouds of dust or whirlwinds ; but I afterwards
            learned from our Mexicans that it was steam. from hot springs. The steam sometimes
            issued forth in jets, rising from fifty to one hundred feet high, and seemed to extend
            along the plain for a mile or more. I was desirous to examine these springs ; but the
            intervening space was so uch overflowed, that it was not considered safe to do so. I
            could obtain from the arrieros no information about them. A number of ducks were shot
            near our camp. 408 EL PASO 4 October ltJt. On leaving this morning, we struck nee into

            a superb road, and in t\Yelve miles reached Carrizal (country of reed grass), and
            encamped near an old acequia half a mile from the town, the water in which was scarcelv
            fit for the mules to drink. I did not wish to go to the town, as experience had taught
            me that it was best to avoid the Mexican settlements. We had not been in one where the
            arrieros or teamsters did not get into a row, or return to camp in a state of
            drunkenness. Mr. Thurber rode to the town, and purchased a supply of corn sufficient to

            had been traversing since we first ascended the plateau from the Rio Grande. Mountains
            were seen only at a great dis- tance, while nearer at hand a few low hills rose up here
            and there. Twelve miles brought us to Ojo Caliente (Warm Spring), day's march, it was
            thought best to stop here ; as there lay before us a Jornada of fifty miles without
            water, which it would require two full days to accomplish. Ojo Caliente is a spring
            which rises from the plam about one hundred and fifty yards from the base of a rocky
            hill. Its temperature is nearly the same as that of the atmosphere. A small pool about
            one hundred and twenty feet in circuit, and from three to four deep, is here formed,
            with a sandy bottom, from which warm water bubbles up in many places ; this water has an
            outlet throueh a small creek into the river Carmen, Although we had made But a short in
            which creek some fish were taken and preserved for specimens. This basin afforded an
            excellent opportunity for a bath, and the whole party took advantage of it. A well built
            stone wall, about a yard in thickness, and laid in cement, is built across the basin,
            apparently for the purpose of raising the water. A portion of this wall is now broken
            away. I imagine it to be the work of the Spaniards, who, at some former period, have y '

            and doubtless has long been the resort of Indians, as there are many mor- tars in the
            adjacent rocks. Along one side of the hill there appeared to be a rude wall ; and on the
            summit were circles and heaps of stones, which bore the traces of fire. From here three
            sides unobstructed by pr October 17 th. By seven o'clock, a. m., we had resumed our
            journey over an excellent natural road, equal to the best turnpike. About a mile from
            camp ■we crossed the Bio Carmen, a considerable stream, although dry during the summer,
            when th wanted. Our course was due south : and durin the thirty-five miles made to-day,
            not a hill, gully, or ravine, was passed. There was a gradual ascent for at least twenty
            miles, with no mountains in sight. A few rounded hills were seen at long intervals ; and
            through the openings in these, the plain seemed to extend for sixty or eighty miles. It
            was covered with a luxuriant growth of grass, with scarcely a bush as large as one's
            finger. In order to advance as far as possible, we kept on till dark, and encamped
            without "ater. A few little twigs gathered as we came along, th Moved from camp clock.
            The plain was open, except on our right, _liere, at a distance of a mile, ran a Higch

            accompanied by Messrs. Radziminski, Pratt, Seaton, Force, and Dr. Webb. Soon after we
            saw the 412 EL PASO train start ; whereupon we held in our animals, that it miijht the
            sooner overtake us. About a mile from camp we passed a small arrojo, or ravine, pretty
            well filled with bushes. This arroyo was no sooner passed by the foremost wagon in the
            train, than we were startled by the most terrific jells and shouting ; and on turning
            our heads, to our horror we saw a band of Indians issuing from the arrojo we had passed,
            and charging upon the train. We immediately turned about, put spurs to our animals, and
            rode back with all speed towards the train. The savages, who numbered between thirty and
            forty (as stated to me by those in the rear), were rushing at full speed with their
            lances poised, screaming and yelling, endeavoring to break the line and stampede the
            mules, as they crossed from one side to the other. Others followed, discharging their
            arrows at the teamsters as they passed ; but the teamsters remained eacb by his team,
            keeping the mules in their places, and closing up the line: At the same time they kept
            the enemy at bay by levelling their pistols at them. These men had the presence of mind
            to keep their seats in the saddle and to hold their fire, which the savages wanted to
            draw. Had they fired and missed their mark (and the chances were ten to one against
            their hitting), they would have been pierced by a lance or an arrow the next moment. The
            men who were riding by the side of the wagons sprang to the aid of the teamsters, and
            held tlie leading mules, which kept them in their places. Failing in their attempt to
            frighten the mules and throw the train into disorder, the Indians dashed on towards the

            adjoining hills, pursued "by six or eight of our party. The fleetness of their horses
            and their knowledge of the ground, gave them the advantage ; so that after a pur- suit
            of a mile or two, we gave up the chase, fearing the train might encounter a larger body
            of Indians in ambush, for they scattered in all directions, and con- cealed themselves
            among the rocks or ravines of the hills. The spare animals were all stampeded and lost.
            They became frightened at the first charge, and, not being fastened, were rushing at the
            top of their speed over the plain, driven by a portion of the enemy, before we who were
            in advance could reach them. We lost ten mules and a valuable horse — and secured the
            horse, saddle, and arms of the Indian that was shot. Two of the wagons were pierced with
            bullets, and several arrows were found sticking in the wagons near the teamsters. We dug
            a grave by the side of the road, and de- posited in it the body of the unfortunate
            Mexican who was killed. This being done, we hastened away from the sad scene, the first
            and only occurrence of the kind that had befallen the Commission since it entered the
            field, now more than two years. We had proceeded but a few hundred yards when we noticed
            several heaps of stones, some of them sur- mounted by small crosses, to mark the spots
            where murders had been committed but a short time before, as appeared by their
            freshness. Fragments of clothing also lay around, showing that a severe contest had
            taken place. Fearing that the Indians might rally in larger numbers and renew the

            covered with grass. This plain was ten • or twelve miles wide, bounded on the east by a
            range of hills, and on the west by rugged mountains. On the op- posite side of the lake
            appeared a hacienda amid a grove of cotton- woods — a beautiful spot, which might
            compare with the highly cultivated grounds of a Euro- pean nobleman ; but the mark of
            ruin was upon it — the Apaches had driven away its occupants, and it was fest crumbling

            to Gene- ral T rias. We stopped a few minutes at the gate, and the occupants came out to
            meet us. We endeavored to buy eggs, poultry, or some other kind of fresh pro- visions,
            but found they had " nada, nothing, for sale. This establishment had likewise suffered
            from the Indians, notwithstanding its high wall, which would mclose many hundred cattle.
            On one occasion the savages for mere sport lamed a large number of these cattle, and
            filled up a well near by with their carcasses. On the opposite side of the valley is a
            village called El Sauzillos, or Little Willows. After a march of twenty-four miles from
            El Penol, we reached the Sacramento River, and encamped near the famous battle-field
            where Colonel Doniphan and his brave Missourians gained the decisive victory which
            resulted in the surrender of the city of Chihuahua. The Mexicans did not show much
            judgment in the selection of this spot to resist the approach of the invading force. It
            is on the level summit of a plateau some sixty feet above the valley, and about half a
            mile in width. The plateau juts directly across the Valley we had been travelling, and
            leaves but a narrow passage to the east. If the Americans had been obliged to march
            through this valley, the position of the Mexi- cans would have been a good one. But it

            before him. By this course he exposed himself only to the right or western battery, on
            which he immediately opened his fire, striking terror into the ranks of the enemy, which
            retreated to the adjoining batteries and entrenchments. These also fell, the Mexicans
            retreating to a hill on the opposite side of the valley of the Sacramento, where the
            final conflict took place. This valley is less than half a mile wide, and is intersected
            by the river of the same name, a stream ten or fifteen yards wide, and about a foot
            deep.* itained in tbe official report of Lieutenant Colonel Mitchell, one of the field-

            command of the right wing of the army, in obedience to your or- ders, and at the same
            time gave the necessary instructions to the traders and teamsters in our rear, so as to
            form a field-work with the wagons to fall back upon in the event of our being too hardly
            pressed by over- whelming numbers. After the artillery firing (on both sides) ceased for

            which is a large estimate. Resum- ing our journey this morning,. we came in sight of the
            city on reaching the crest of an elevated plain ten miles distant, from which there is a
            gradual descent to the city. This plain is of a desert-like character, with- out grass,
            and covered with small mezquit bushes. As we approached, and when within four or jBve
            miles of the city, it presented a beautiful appearance, surrounded on three sides by
            picturesque mountains with bold rocky sides quit detached from each other. Chihua- hua

            They soon broke and fled in the utmost Confusion, and in every direction, towards the
            surrounding mountnins. I immediately ordered the men to remount and charge the battery
            on our right, which was done in gallant style. When we reached the top of the hill we
            found that the Mexicans had fled, leaving the whole of their cannon, ammunition, wagons,

            Apaches ; they are among the finest horsemen in the world, possess many fire-arms, which

            than the Apaches, whose range we had now passed. dl AND ITS VICINITY. 425 We had no
            sooner arrived, than the character of our party was known throughout the city ; and many
            appli- cants appeared in quest of employment, most of them persons who wanted to get 'to
            their homes. Among these were several Americans from Texas, who had come here with
            merchant trains, and been discharsed They earnestly begged for situations, or to be
            permit- ted to accompany the train for the protection it would afford them. I selected
            such men as I required, among them an excellent blacksmith, whom 1 wanted exceed- Sy
            ''ind could not procure at El Paso. The American consul, Bennet Riddells, Esq., called
            the morning after our arrival. This gentleman has long resided in this city, and is
            married to a Mexican lady. Having letters of introduction to a number of the principal
            citizens of the place, Mr. Eiddells accom- panied me in delivering them. Among the
            gentlemen on whom I called, were Seuores Chaves, Zuloaga, and Jaques. Captain
            Bustamente, and Dr. Dubois, the last a French physician of high scientific attainments,
            and long resident in Chihuahua. Several of the American residents called on me during
            the day, among them fr. Lewis Flotte, of Barranca Colorada, the gentle- wan whose silver
            mine and smelting works I visited on my way from Carrelitos to El Paso. I heard from Mr.
            Flotte, a reiteration of what I had een told at Correlitos, and at the mine, of his
            perse- cutions ; in consequence of which, he had been driven to the extremity of selling
            his mine as well as his estate at Barranca, at a great sacrifice. He had endeavored in
            vain to obtain protection of the State authorities. The statement of Mr. Flotte was

            I remained in Chihuahua; which, however, T declined. Experience had shown us that after
            once going into camp life, it is better to remain there steadily. One soon becomes
            accustomed to a tent; and even in cold weather, it is preferable to quarters, unless one

            education he went to Europe, where he spent eight years travelling in various parts,
            although he remained most of the time in England and France. He is well versed in
            several of the European languages, and speaks English with ojreat correctness. Of

            influence in the .State. I have before mentioned the sacrifices he made when his country
            was invaded by the Americans, which greatly impoverished him. There are not many rsuch
            patriots in Mexico ; if there were, she would not be in the position she now is. There

            the richest man in the State. As a politician, he is at the head of the moderate party.
            A few days after our arrival, I heard that the train we passed on its way to El Paso was
            attacked 'by the Apaches at the same place where we had the encoun- ter with them, and
            that it lost twenty-eight mules. Several men were killed, and three of the women made
            captives. . On -the 28th, I was invited, together with the offi- cers of the Commission,
            to a dinner given by General -Trias. Besides the gentlemen who accompanied me, there
            were about forty others present, embracing offi- cers of the Mexican army and citizens
            of the place.' The entertainment was conducted in true Mexican style, embracing a great
            variety of dishes served up in as many courses. The waiters were all soldiers, and
            performed their duty as well as the trained function- aries at our large hotels. A band
            of music was in attendance, and the affair was, on the whole, an ele- gant one.
            Patriotic toasts were drunk, and among those given by the Mexicans were Washington and .
            i'anklin. In return we gave the heroes of the Mexican revolution,. Iturbide, Hidalgo,
            Allende, and Jimenez. On leaving the table, we adjourned to the drawing 428 CHIHUAHUA
            room, where a large number of ladies soon after assem- bled to a ball. This was an
            afterpiece as unexpected fi to us as it was agreeable. The Mexican ladies, it is well
            known, have a great passion for balls, and are most graceful dancers. They kept it up
            incessantly, alternating from quadrilles to waltzes and polkas, with- out manifesting
            the slightest fatigue. The music was very good, consisting of harps and violins. One
            would hardly expect to find in a town situated as this is, on the very confines of
            civilization, twelve hundred miles from the capital, and six or eight hundred from
            either ocean, so much elegance of manner and taste in dress; for few of the ladies had
            ever been from home. Many possessed as fair complexions as English or American ladies,
            although the brunettes predominated. The Mexican like the Spanish ladies have a natural
            grace- fulness of manner, which has been observed, by all travellers, and has captivated
            most foreigners who have taken up their residence in the country.* On this occasion, one

            and in general prosperity. There is still' another cause for the decline of -Northern
            and Central Mexico which deserves to be noticed. I allude to the expulsion of the
            Jesuits. * latever ■ may have been the sins ascribed ■eligious order, it this deniable
            fact that during their sway these States attained a higher degree of pi'osperity than at
            any other period ; and with them 432 CHIHUAHUA this prosperity departed. This remark
            will also apply to California while under the dominion of Mexico. No one has ever kept
            the Indians under such subjection as the Jesuits ; and when the latter were expelled,
            all control over the former was lost. In every large town are seen the fine edifices
            which were in the coui'se of erection by tliem. Chihuahua possesses one of these, a
            large church and college, the walls of which were nearly up. These buildings remain just
            as they were left."* .An apartment in the college was the place of confinement of the
            patriot Hidalgo and his associates, who were executed here in 1811. It is now a black-
            smith's shop. The city is regularly laid out, with broad and clean streets, some of
            which are paved, and contain hand- some and well-built houses, both of stone and adobe.
            When of the latter material, they are plastered or stuc- coed, and afterwards colored or
            whitewashed. Most * Christian sects may cavil about their success among the Indiaii
            tribes; but it is an undeniable fact, that the Jesuits during their sway accomplished
            more than all other religious denominations. They brought the tribes of Mexico and
            Cahfornia under the most complete subjection, and kept them so until their order was
            suppressed. And how was this done ? Xot by the sword, nor by treaty, nor by presents,
            nor by In- dian agents, who would sacrifice the poor creatures without scruple or
            remorse for their. own vile gains. The Indian was taught Christianity, with many of the
            arts of civilized life, and how to sustain himself by his labor. By this simple means
            the Society of Jesus accomplished more towards ameliorating the condition of the
            Indialis than, the United* States have clone since the settlement of the country. The
            Jesuits did all this trom a heartfelt desire to improve the moral and social as well as
            the spiritual condition of this people, and at an expense infinitely less than we now
            pay to agents alone, setting aside the millions annually appropriated for indemnities,
            presents, etc. ■I 1 AND ITS VICINITY. 433 of them have "but one story ; yet they are
            large, and built in squares, with courts in the centre. Having thick walls and few
            windows, such dw'ellings are cooler and better adapted to the climate than if built in
            our northern mode. The rooms are always from fourteen to eighteen feet high, with brick
            floors, which contri- bute to their coolness. An aqueduct supplies that greatest of
            luxuries, an abundance of pure water. It is well constructed of stone, and, with its
            long ranges of arches winding over the rough ground and spanning the valleys on its way
            to the city, presents a highly picturesque appearance. It was built at the close of the
            last century, and has an extent of about three miles and a half. In addition to this, a
            small stream runs by the northern part of the city ; so that in respect to water, no
            city is better sup- plied. The most important edifice in Chihuahua is its cathedral, or,
            as it is here called, the parochial church. This stands on one side of the plaza. It is
            built of cut stone, of a very light color, and has two well-propor- tioned towers and a
            dome. The people pride them- selves much on this building, which is said to be only
            second to the great cathedral of Mexico. If strict adherence to the principles of a
            particular order of archi- tecture constitutes beauty, this edifice will be found
            Wanting. It partakes of the Gothic and the Ehzabeth- an styles, with a profusion of
            ornament, similar to that "which was practised in Spain after the expulsion of tHe Moors
            ; still its appearance is very imposing, and is equalled by few churches in the United
            States. Its interior is less chaste than its exterior. VOL. II. — 28 F 43 i CHIHUAHUA
            This churcli was erected from a fund raised by a tax of one real (twelve and a lialf
            cents) on every mark of silver (eiglit dollars) obtained from tlie mines of Santa
            Eulalia five leagues from the city. The fund was collected during a period of
            seventy-two years, commencing in the year 1717, and terminating in 1789. From it was
            built the Cathedral of Chihua- hua, at a cost of eight hundred thousand dollars, and a
            church at Santa Eulalia at a cost of one hundred and fifty thousand dollarSj leaving a
            considerable sum unex- pended. From this may be formed some idea of the richness of the
            mines of this country. These sums, raised by a tax at the rate mentioned, would require
            a gross income on the part of the mine of fifty-one mil- lion two hundred thousand
            dollars to erect the former, and nine million six hundred thousand dollars for the
            latter edifice, or, together, sixty million eight hundred thousand dollars. Nearly a
            million- of dollars a year for seventy-two years. The square on which this church stands
            is occupied with various public buildings ; among which, on the east side, is the
            Governor's Palace, as it is called, but which merely embraces his reception room and the
            State offices. 4 There are several other churches in the city, which, though small, are
            built with much taste. One of these, Santa Rita, is shown in the sketch. There is a Casa
            de Moneda, or Mint, here, which I visited. In it silver and gold are coined, but chiefly
            -silver, and that by a most primitive process of manual power. Each State in which there
            are many mines has a mint, which is let to an individual or firm, and is fi AND ITS
            VICINITY. 435 not under the direction of the State or general govern- ment. For coining
            a mark of silver, without separa- ting the gold, the charge is two reals (twenty-five
            cents) ; for coining and separating the gold, five reals (sixty-two and a half cents).
            This coin is said to yield a profit of five per cent, upon its current value at the
            United States Mint. It is put up in sacks of raw hide containing one thousand and two
            thousand dollars each. These shrink on drying, and press the coin so closely as to
            prevent friction. All the silver in the State contains gold, which is separated in large
            platina kettles, with the aid of sulphuric acid. I saw two of them, which had a capacity
            of about five gallons. They looked little better than our iron camp kettles, and cost
            five hundred dollars each. Among other public places of note is an arena for bull
            fights, a favorite amusement with the Mexicans. An exhibition took place while we were
            here ; but having once witnessed one of these cruel sights at El Paso, I had no desire
            to be present at another. In an open square in another part of the city is a rude
            monument, of an obelisk form, to the memory of the heroes of the revolution, Iturbide,
            Hidalgo, Allen- 'e,- and Jimenez, but without any inscription. On one side of this
            square was pointed out to me the place where the Emperor Iturbide was shot. large trade
            carried on here with the om United States, by means of caravans Saint Louis, Missouri,
            and San Antonio, Texas. Until very recently, the trade was carried on wholly by way of
            Saint Louis, Santa Ee, and El Taso, a distance of ciore than one thousand five hundred
            miles, and re- 43 6 CHIHUAHUl, quiring montli3 for the journey. Latterly, a much shorter
            route has been opened by way of San An- tonio and the Presidio del Norte, lessening the
            dis- tance of land carriage more than one half. Formerly traders left Missouri with
            large trains of merchandise, and, on arriving here, opened their stores and sold their
            goods themselves. This was a very irregular business, leading sometimes to the
            accumulation of large stocks, and proving ruinous to some of the par- ties concerned.
            The trade is now more confined to I the resident merchants of the city. Governor Cordero
            is one of the largest merchants ; and next to him are several American houses of high
            respectability. There are now some fine stores in the town, in which every variety of
            merchandise can be procured. * If a merchant here desires to make his purchases himself
            in ISew York or our other great markets, he must leave here in the fall when it will
            require from forty to fifty days to reach his destination by way ox New Orleans. His
            goods must then be purchased and shipped either to Indiauola, on the Gulf of Mexico, to
            be sent by San Antouio, or to St. Louis, Missouri, and thence by water to Independence.
            "Novr conies the most difficult part of the transportation (say, for example, from the
            latter place). Wagons, mules, harness, and the various trappinmust be purchased, and
            teamsters procured ; all of which requires much time and a large outlay. The large
            Missouri wagons, which carry from five thousand to five thousand five hundred pounds,
            cost about two hundred dollars each; the best Kentucky mules, ninety to one hundred
            dollars; harness, one hundred dollars ; water kegs, extra chains, ropes, etc.,
            twenty-five dollars for each wagon. These large wagons require ten mules each ; so that
            a complete team ready for the plains would cot from twelve hundred to thirteen hundred
            dollars ; and twenty of these, which is not a large train, twenty-six"thousand dollars.
            Then each team must have its teamster at from twenty to twenty-five dollars a month; and

            irrigated from the aqueduct or the stream. We were not here in the season to see their
            beauties, and I visited them but once. The fruits cul- tivated are apples, pears,
            peaches, figs, melons, and grapes. The variety of vegetables is not large; not on
            incapacity produce them, but Those gene- I'ally cultivated are beans, peas, maize, red
            pepper, tomatoes, onions, lentils, beets, cabbages, etc. Wheat, barley, and alfalfa (a
            species of lucerne), are cultivated on the farms. I The alfalfa is extensively
            cultivated as far north as El Paso, and is every where considered as one of the Piost
            profitable of farm crops, yielding abundantly without irrigation, and possessing the
            valuable property when once established of flourishing in perennial vigor for any length
            of time. In the vicinity of Chihuahua, where the climate is mild, it is cut eight times
            a year, and sold for green fodder at a real (twelve and a half cents) per bunch of
            twenty-five pounds. Mr. Eid- clelk our consul here, stated, that from a field of fif-
            Jred dollai-s a month. From fifteen to twenty extra mules would be necessary for such a
            tram ; as, on then- long journeys, accidents cannot be avoided. Men to herd and take
            care of the animals must also be provided ; and, finally, provisions for the journey.
            This wi!i give an idea of the expense of fitting oixl a cara\an or train; asd if the
            mer- chant gets bact with his goods in ten months from the time he left, thout
            encounters with hostile Indians, or the loss of any of his wag- ons and their contents,
            in fording streams and otherwise, he may con- sider himself fortunate It cannot be
            expected that a merchant will be satisfied with very small profits after such an
            expedition. 438 CHIHUAHUxV teen acres lie Lad realized in one year two thousand one
            hundred and eighty dollars. This field when I saw it, on the last day of October, was as
            green as our meadows in June.* I shall not enter into any particulars as to the great
            number and variety of mines in the State of Chihuahua, as the subject is too extensive
            to be treated of in a work like the present. I have, however, col- lected much
            information respecting it, which may hereafter be given to the public. At present I will
            merely say, that the mineral wealth of Chihuahua is not surpassed, if equalled, in
            variety and extent by any State in the world. Silver is the most abundant ; but there is
            also gold, copper, lead, iron, and tin. Cinnabar is also said to be found ; but I cannot
            speak of it with certainty. Of bituminous coal I saw a fine specimen. * A late San
            Francisco paper, in speating of the introduction of alfalfa into Californiaj where it is
            known as " Chilian cloven" says it is greatly in use in the mining districts of Chili,
            where the lands are very sterile, and rain is of seldom occurrjince. " Natural grasses
            are, there- fore, of scanty growth ; and the miners are compelled to rely for the
            maintenance of their animals upon the alfalfa estates, which lie within the narrow
            valleys of that mountainous region. The supply would, how- be and possessed of such
            extraordinary nutritious properties. With the addition of a little barley, it is found
            to keep mules in the best working condition ; and consequently the owner of one of these
            alfalfa haciendas is able to draw from his estates a much larger revenue than if culti-
            vated in grain. In its green state, cattle feed upon it with the utmost avidity, and
            acquire flesh so fast, that it is the practice in Chili to drive herds from the grass
            pastures of the south, for hundreds of miles, m order to obtain the benefit of its use.
            The land is prepared for the seed of this plant in the same manner as for clover, it
            being, in truth, of the same family as the latter." 1. AND ITS VICINITY. 439 O An idea
            may be formed of the extent to which mining operations were formerly carried on here
            from the immense heaps of scoria and dross which lie about the city, and particularly
            near the bed of the creek, as it is approached from the north. So imperfectly has the
            silver been extracted from this ore, that a regular business is now carried on in
            workinsr the scoria over again, which is said to pay. The high table-land, which forms
            the larger portion of the State, is not adapted to agriculture ; but for grazing and the
            rearing of large herds of cattle, horses, and sheep, it is unsurpassed, I have heard it
            stated, that a man who settled near the Casas Grandes Hiver in 1785, took with him four
            cows and a bull, from which, in the year 1829 a herd of fnvfxr tl-innQnnrl in the year
            1829 he had become possessor of of forty thousand cattle. The vast plains filled ch

            is proper 440 CHIHUAHUA to notice a singular "breed of diminutive dogs which are found
            only here, and are eagerly sought for by strangers who visit the place. How these little
            creatures originated I was not able to learn, although I made many inquiries. These dogs
            have not the shape of common lap-dogs, or of the stunted, dwarfish curs, with large
            bodies and short legs, which are of com- mon occurrence ; but they possess the elegant
            form of a full-grown mastiff, with small heads, and slender and delicate limbs and
            bodies. The hair is short and fine on their backs, while on the lower part of their
            bodies it is little more than down. The forehead is remarkably prominent, and the eyes
            large and full. They are also noted for their sagacity. These dogs are highly prized
            throughout Mexico, and readily com- mand fifty dollars at the capital. In Chihuahua they
            briiig from five dollars to a doubloon (sixteen dollars) each, according to the purity
            of the breed. Several were brought home by the gentlemen of the Commis- sion. I have
            two, which weigh respectively three pounds six ounces and four pounds.* Many persons
            mistake these Chihuahua dogs for the misnamed prairie-dog, a little animal of the mar-
            mot species, about which so much has been said by all who traverse the prairies. Even
            intelligent travellers who have not seen both have fallen into this error. f * The bitch

            their holes when pursued. They are known in Mexico by the name of ' Chihuahua dogs.'" —

            of men with it was small in 'et o proportion, it would be of no acfvant; it might cause
            delays. So I preferred starting by our- selves. All accounts received from the south
            brought the unpleasant news, that for six hundred miles the road was infested by the

            depredations than ever, attacking not only travellers but villages in open day. We did
            not get off until one o'clock, so that our day's journey was necessarily short. We made,
            however, )od road. On leaving the city, we passed the base of a mountain four miles
            distant, when we again emerged into an open plain. It was nearly dark when we reached a
            pond, about half a ttiile from the road on our right, where we encamp- ed. Around this

            stony and rough. In this is the dry bed of a stream, which, during the rainy season, is
            filled with water; and,, judging from the appearance of the bushes and drift wood, must
            quite recently have been much swollen. East of this defile, the mountains which here
            cross the valley rise abruptly, and 444 • CHIHCTAHTJA present quite a picturesque
            appearance. Rocky of d the summits of the hills are crowned with masses resemblino works
            of art. About half way through, on the right, is a fine spring, and near by a deserted
            rancho, now in a state of ruin. What object any one could have in occupying such a spot,
            I cannot imagine ; for there seemed to be no land fit for cultivation or for grazing. In
            this canon is a conical hill, around which winds a spiral road, and on whose summit is a
            stone parapet, the work of some ancient people. A little further on, we passed another
            rancho ; from the top of the parapet peeped a few heads, and in their midst a huge
            blunderbuss mounted on a swivel, probably to overawe the Indians. On emerging from i;
            the canon, we entered a broad plain, extending to the south as far as the eye could
            reach. A few isolated hills were alone seen in the far distance. The plain i here was
            about twenty -five miles wide. Five or six miles further brought us to BacMmba, a
            cluster of about a dozen houses, with a fine spring of water, T which is retained in a
            pond by a wall below it. From this, the water is conducted to some gardens, in which I
            noticed many fig-trees. This place is noted for its fine apples ; but "vre were unable
            to procure any to satisfy us of the truth of the report. Here we encamp- ed, after a
            march of twenty miles. November 3d. A train of wagons from Chihua- hua, belonging to
            Seiior Olivares, joined us last night, and left again before daylight We continued our
            journey over the same plain s before, in a direction about south south-east, the road
            beinir excellent. Grass k th TO THE RIO FLORIDO. 445 I i !■ fc was scant, the plain
            being of a desert-like character, covered with low mezcjuit bushes, various kinds of
            cacti, yucca, and the fouquiera ; forming as formidable a collection of thorny plants as
            one need wish to make his way through. No better indication of the desert character of a
            country is required than the fou- quiera, which thrives only in the most barren and arid
            spots. Ten miles from Bachimba the road divides, one branch leading south-east to San
            Pablo, which is the most direct, and the other to Santa Cruz, ten miles distant. We took
            the latter, in order to obtain a sup- ply of flour there for our journey. This town
            stands near the San Pedro Creek, a' tributary of the Conchos Kiver, "and extends for
            nearly a mile along the valley. Parts of it are compactly built ; yet I did not observe
            a good-looking house in it Men, women, and chil- dren crowded to the doors as we passed,
            attracted by the cracking of the whips and yells of the teamsters, and seemed to eye us
            with as much curiosity as though they had never seen a train before. It is said to con-
            tain four or five thousand inhabitants. We passed directly through without stopping, and
            crossed the creek, a fine stream of clear water, which rises in the mountains about one
            hundred miles to the west, when we were suddenly brought to a stand by a dilapidated
            bridge, across an acequia. Such was the condition of this bridge, that even the riding
            animals would not cross it. We had, therefore, to cut branches from the cotton-wood
            trees, lay them on the bridge, and cover the whole with earth, before we could make it
            passable. . Such a bridge on the great highway from 446 CHIHUAHUA the capital to the
            larger towns at the south and to the city of Mexico, is a disgrace to the State, and
            more so to the town within half a mile of it. A few hours' labor would render it safe
            and permanent; yet no one will do it. Each train managed to get over as we did, and
            appearances indicated that it had long been in the same plight. Encamped at a village a
            mile from the stream, near the grist-mill where we were to obtain our flour. I had
            letters of introduction to the owner, but he was absent. He is a gentleman of much
            enterprise, having at this . place, in addition to his flouring mill, a cotton gin and
            smelting furnace. The ore is brought from a mine ten miles distant. There is no wood
            near, and the fur- naces have to be supplied with fuel by diggingup the roots of the
            mezquit chapporal. Heaps of this lay by the road side, from which it is carried on the
            backs F ■ of donkeys or men to the furnaces. I learned that the mine was not profitable,
            but that another had been discovered, which was to be worked by the same per- son, who
            would bring the ore here to be reduced. November Uh. Taking an easterly course, we
            struck the main road from San Pablo in four or five miles after setting out, when we
            again turned south-east. The road was good, with the same barren plain as yester- day. A
            tire here fell from one of the wagon wheels, notwithstanding the thorough overhauling
            they had received at Chihuahua ; but such is the dryness of the climate, that these
            accidents will occur in spite of every precaution. The result was a detention of two
            hours, \ to wedge up the tire ; after which we pushed on more rapidly, and reached
            Saucillo said to be twenty-three /h TO THE RIO FLORIDO. 447 miles from Santa Cruz,
            wliere we encamped, about one hundred and fifty yards from the river Conchos. As we
            entered the village, which consists of a clus- ter of mud houses, mostly in a decaying
            state, we noticed the whole population running to and fro in a great state of alarm, and
            at the same time a train of wagons entering from the south. We soon learned the cause of
            the excitement. The town had been entered an hour before by a band of Comanche Indians ;
            who attempted to drive off the cattle. They were pursued by the men of the place, and in
            retreating, lanced an Unarmed man who was driving cattle. Each of these fiends, out of
            mere sport, plunged his lance into the poor creature, as they passed him lying on the
            ground. The people were just bringing in his dead body. The Indians had also attacked
            the train that was entering, and succeeded in causing a stampede among the loose
            animals, fifteen in number, which they drove off. To save the rest, the party returned
            to Saucillo, which they tad just left. This was the train of Seuor Olivares, which had
            proposed joining us at Chihuahua. In their attack to-day, the Indians killed eighteen
            head of beef-cattle, which they could not drive off. The bodies of eight of these were
            secured by the villagers ; irom which we obtained a sunplv of beef. Such is the course
            pursued by the Indians. When they carry off cattle, they destroy them ; and even when
            they want food, they do not kill and preserve their eat as the Mexicans do but take
            merely what they Want for a meal, and leave the remainder. Hence, the immense
            destruction of beef cattle and mules. A band f one hundred Indians destroy cattle enough
            to sub- ! 448 CHIHUAHUA sist ten or twenty times that number ; and as they raise none
            themselves, it may be conceived what inroads they make upon the herds of the Mexicans.
            While we were at Chihuahua, the Comanches made a great haul near this place. A large
            train of wagons, with one hundred and forty mules, on its way from the capital to the
            fair of San Juan, had just encamped, taken the mules from the wagons, and sent them with
            four men to a pool of water a quarter of a mile distant. While there a band of
            Comanches, who lay concealed with their horses in a bush near by, sud- denly rushed upon
            them, stampeded the whole caba- llada, and succeqded in driving every animal off. The
            herders and teamsters in charge could no nothing to save them. The owner raised a large
            party a day or two after, took the trail, and was in pursuit of the rob- bers when we
            passed along. A large portion of the population of Saucillo are miners who work on their
            own account, called gambu- €inos. These men perambulate the mining regions much as our
            Californians do in " prospecting," when they occasionally stumble on a vein which
            rewards them for their labors. This, however, is but seldom ; for, possessing no
            scientific and but little practical knowledge, their discoveries are almost purely acci-
            dental. Around the village are heaps of scorias, refuse ore, and broken furnaces, the
            results of the labors of these silver hunters. movemher 5th. Before starting this
            morning, all the fire-arms were inspected, and a further supply of am- munition served
            out. I placed the party under the ?rders of Mr. Radziminski, chief engineer, who had TO
            THE KIO FLORIDO. 449 had experience as a inilitarj officer. The villagers, who knew the
            haunts of the Indians, said they were then near our camp, and although we did not see
            them they had their spies watching our movements. A man was now placed by the leading
            mules of each team in addition to the teamster, to keep them in place ; as our safety
            depended on the preservation of our ani- mals. Five of the soldiers were also placed
            wdth the wagons, and five about fifty yards in advance of the train. The remainder of
            the party were equally di- vided between the front and rear. Our course for the first
            four miles laj through a thick chapporal, where an enemy might easily lie in ambush and
            surprise a party. It was, therefore, with some anxiety that we passed this place. On our
            left, for a mile or more, were ruins of decayed buildings ; which led me to believe that
            the town must have been much larger in former times. Several large acequias, now
            destitute of water, crossed our road, another evidence that more of the valley had once
            been cultivated. Passed some isolated mountains on our left, where there are some silver
            mines, the ore from which is taken to Saucillo to be smelted ; but, whether owing to the
            poorness of the ore, or defective methods of separating the metal from it, they barely
            pay the ex- pense of working. There are other mines in the hills to the right which
            yield more, and are considered pro- fitable. These also belong to Saucillo, or rather to
            the gambucinos of that place. About fifteen miles from Saucillo we reached by a gradual
            ascent the summit of a plateau, when a broad expanse of plain again opened before us.
            From here VOL. n. — 29 450 CHIHUAHUA we could trace the course of the Conchos bj the
            wood along its banks. This, next to the Rio Grande, is the largest river in the State.
            It has its rise high up in the Sierra Madre ; it first flows in a southerly, next in an
            easterly, then in a north-easterly, and finally in a northerly course, when it
            discharges itself into the Rio Grande near the Presidio del Norte. Its principal
            tributaries are the Florido, De Buenavista, San Pedro, Chihuahua, and Balleza. These,
            with their lesser branches, water more than a third of the State. The Conchos itself has
            a course of one hundred and forty leagues, or about three hundred and seventy miles. In
            eighteen miles we reached La Cruz, a small village of three hundred inhabitants, and
            about five miles further Las Garzas, both on the river Conchos. The bottom lands are
            here broad, and seemed to be highly cultivated. Large haciendas appeared from among
            thick groves of cotton-woods, and exhibited quite an agreeable spectacle, after several
            days' travel - over barren districts. After passing Las Garzas, we forded the Conchos,
            here a fine clear and rapid stream about two hundred yards across. After a day's jour-
            ney of thirty miles, we reached Santa Rosalia, and encamped on the banks of the Rio
            Florido, a small stream which enters the Conchos at this place. Santa Rosalia is the
            most considerable town we had met with since leaving Chihuahua, having almost five
            thousand inhabitants. It stands on ia spur of the pla- teau in the angle formed by the
            Conchos and Florido Rivers, about sixty or eighty feet above the valley. Like all
            Mexican towns we had thus far een, it is on the decline. There is rather a fine church
            here in the J " *J TO THE RIO FLORIDO. 451 I t- course of erection, built of adobe,
            except the doorways and windows, which are of the soft sand-stone of the conntrj. Some
            of the arches which are to support the roof are already finished, and are well built. To
            raise these arches, the intermediate spaces are built up with adobe and a few timbers,
            and the arch laid directly on this wall. When the arch is completed, the adobe is
            removed. This seems a quicker and less expensive mode than to use a framework, as we do.
            South of the town are a redoubt and fort erected by the Mexicans when they expected an
            invasion from General Wool, who they heard was approaching in / that direct 3 all of
            adobe ball will pass them without making a breach. But the invasion came from the north
            ; and Colonel Doniphan was so uncivil as to give them no opportunity to use their
            defences, but approached where there were none ; so that the .labor of the Santa
            Rosalians was thrown away. November 6th. We were detained several hours this morning to
            set the tires on two of our wagons, which gave me an opportunity to look about the town.
            Eleva- ted above the plain, I could see for a long distance the valleys of the streams
            which unite here ; they seemed to be quite broad, presenting a fine bottom for
            cultivation. We heard from the people here, that a large band of Comanches crossed the
            Conchos early this morning near Las Garzas, and went towards the mountains on our left ;
            evidently, with the intention of going south- wardly towards the settlements, and
            perhaps of lying lu ambush for passing trains. At 1 o'clock p. M. we asrain ?ot oflF,
            and, ascending fa""' o 452 CHIHUAHUA tlie plateau, struck across it in a direction east
            south- east over a desert plain, with an excellent road. About five miles off on our
            left, we saw the course of the Rio r Florido. It was an hour after dark before we
            reached the village of Ramada twenty-three miles distant, on that stream. This is a
            place of four hundred inhabi- tants, and contains, along with its tumble-down tene-
            ments, a crumbling church. In this last, are some pretty good paintings, but they are
            suflPering much from neglect ; for the people are so indolent, that they will not lift a
            hand, even for a few hours, to fill up the cre- vices in the decaying walls, to save
            these once valu- able pictures from destruction. * November 7t7i. Leaving the valley of
            the Rio Flo- rido, our course lay south across the plateau, here elevated not more than
            ten or fifteen feet above the bottom land, which we followed for several hours. Saw
            several large haciendas along the river with cat- tle grazing near. We had hoped to
            reach Guajuquilla to-day; but found it best to encamp at a well about twenty miles from
            Ramada, as we could not reach that place till after dark. Experience had taught us not
            to travel after nightfall when we could avoid it. On reach- ing these towns or
            haciendas, we required feed for our animals, which was generally corn-stalks ; and
            unless we made arrangements an hour or two before dark, it could not be obtained. There
            are other difficulties in approaching these towns after dark, such as the ace- quias and
            broken bridges, the difficulty of selecting proper places to encamp in, etc. Where we
            had to depend on ourselves alone, and were in an unsettled country, it made no
            difference. \l J, TO THE RIO FLORIDO. 453 J We obtained water at a well here, for which
            we had to pay three cents a head for our animals. There was a large hacienda near, the
            people of Avhieh seemed to have no other means of living than what they obtain- ed from
            this tax on their water. This is not an unusual practice where wells have been sunk, at
            a great ex- pense, and where men are kept to protect them. This was formerly a large
            stock estate ; but being far from ■ any town, its cattle have all been stolen by the
            Indians. The plain is here about twenty -five miles wide , being limited by 'ranges of
            mountains that distance apart. At the south, no mountains were visible. Novemher Sth.
            Twelve miles brought us to the old town of GuajuquiIIa (pronounced Wa*-hu-ke-yah). It IS
            also known as Jimenes (after the patriot of that name) on the maps ; but in no instance
            did I hear it called by any other than its primitive Indian title. This town is situated
            near the river Florido, and is the cleanest looking place we had thus far seen in the
            State, the capital only excepted. Its population is about seven thousand; but for so
            large a place, it shows very little activity, there being but three or four small shops,
            containing altogether less goods than would be found in a village store in the United
            States, There the population did not exceed one thousand. It is altogether an
            agricultural town, being in the midst of a broad and fertile valley extending along both
            sides of the river. As it is off the main road, few travellers pass through it. Our
            little train, therefore, conducted ' ty about forty armed men, brought out io their
            doors the occupants of the houses in the streets through hich we passed. The people were
            more fair and 454 CHIHUAHUA cleanly -looking than usual, and exhibited less of the
            Indian physiognomy and complexion. Having more wagon tires to set, and some blacksmith's
            work to do, we took occasion to look about the place, and found the people polite and
            desirous to serve us. Corn, barley, vegetables, eggs, and poultry, were brought to our
            camp for sale, for the first time since we entered the country. South of the town is a
            small monument built of adobe to the height of about twenty -five feet, in honor of Our
            Lady of Guadalupe, whose full length portrait, or effigy, stuck into a frame, is
            inserted in a niche at the top of the monument. The picture is about two feet in length,
            and appeared to be an ordinary colored lithog raph. The monument is an unshapely affair;
            and seemed to be fashioned in literal obedience to the command, not to make to oneself
            "the likeness of any thing in the heavens above, or in the earth beneath, or in the
            waters under the earth." It is but fair to add, that I was told the monument was built
            by a priest, who died before he completed his plans. The river Florido has here a bottom
            of three or four miles width; most of IS vated, and considerable portion in cotton,
            which thrives well here. In fact, there is more land here under cultivation than at any
            place I had seen in the country, not excepting the valley of the Rio Grande. As an
            evidence of its secluded position, I was told that there were but two foreigners in it,
            a Spaniard and a Frenchman, both of whom honored us with visits. • November dtJi. In
            consequence of the deficiency of tools, we made slow progress in repairing our wagons.
            We had heard at Chihuahua of the existence of large * n,\. In f } "1 -1| TO THE RIO
            FLORIDO. . 455 masses of native iron, or meteorites in this part of the State ; and we
            made inquiries respecting them as we came along. We were here tmd that they were to be
            found about six leagues distant. Dr, Webb determined to avail himself of our detention
            to examine these masses. He accordingly procured a guide in the town, who pro- fessed to
            know where the objects of his inquiry were to be found ; and taking with him our ten
            soldiers and three others of our party, he set off from camp. He expected, from the
            information given him, that he could reach the place in a few hours, and be back early
            in the morning. Colonel Doniphan, with the army of the west, left this place for Parras
            by the Bolson de Mapimi. As that district of country is now in possession of the Coman-
            ches and Lipans, who are there some thousands strong, it is not considered safe for
            parties of less than one or two hundred to attempt it. We avoided it entirely by keeping
            to the west, though it made the route full three days longer." Novemher 10th Dr. Webb
            returned this morning without having found the object of his search. It ap- peared that
            on reaching the place designated, the guide became somewhat confused ; and on being
            questioned * I take this occasion to express my acTvuowleclgment to Di\ Wisli- eriusj
            whose " Memoir of a tour through Northern Mexico, connected with Colonel Doniphan's
            Expedition, iQ 1846-47," has been of great ser- vice to me, and was my only guide from
            Chihuahua to Guajuquilla and again after leanng Parras. I have great pleasure in
            testifying to the accuracy of this memoir, which is a model of its kind; and I do not
            liesitate to say, that no official report has ever been published by our government,
            Avhich, in the same space, embraces so much and such ac- curate information. • * 456
            CHIHUAHUA more closely, tlie fellow acknowledged that lie had not been there in twenty
            years, and had forgotten their precise locality. He also pretended to be much alarmed on
            account of the Indians, and declared that it was not safe to go further. The Doctor,
            however, compelled him to lead them about for miles in every direction, tut to no
            purpose. In the afternoon we resumed our journey, intend- ing to reach Totonilco about
            ten miles distant; but we had not proceeded far before we found the road overflowed by
            the bursting of an acequia which ran by its side. The wagons sank deep in the mud, ren-
            dering it extremely difficult to get along. On both sides of the road were hedge fences,
            so that we could not turn out. Mr. Flotte's' large carriage got mired ; and in the
            struggle to extricate it, the tongue and hounds were broken. In consequence of this
            delay, night overtook us before we had completed our day journey, and rendered it
            difficult to find our way. Finally, in crossing a bridge over a large acequia near the
            Hacienda Blanca our large provision wagon, " the ark," broke through a hole, which was
            not perceived those in advance, upset, and precipitated its con- s the water. This
            accident ) as the vehicle contained all our provisions for forty days. There was no
            alternative, therefore, but to stop where we were, directly in the road, closely hemmed
            in with mezquit bushes. Our men were obliged to jump into the water, which was three
            feet deep and about fifteen wide. Many things sank to the bottom. Our flour, which was
            in sacks, sugar, coffee, rice, etc., were, thoroughly wet. TO THE RIO FLORIDO. 457
            November IWi. Our provisions were spread out in the sun to-claj on India rubber blankets
            and tent- cloths. The result of the disaster was the loss of all our sugar, and about
            one third of the flour. After a few \ hours' drying, the coffee and rice were stowed
            away for a further drying in the afternoon, and we again set off. Finding that Totonilco
            was not on our direct road, we here took another, leading to the village of La Za- imta
            (The Shoe), eighteen miles distant, which we reached before sunset, and encam23ed.
            November 12th. Our next stopping place was the Hacienda del Rio Florida about fifteen
            miles distant ; but having heard of a remarkable meteorite at the Hacienda de Concepcion
            about six miles from the direct route, I determined to let the train pass on, while I
            with a small party took the Concepcion road. Dr. Webb, Messrs. Radziminski, Seaton,
            Jacobs, and Force, with myself, made the party. Ten miles from Zapata, across the
            table-land, brought us to a small stream, where, encompassed in a grove of cotton-
            woods, lay the pretty village to which we were des- tined. On our arrival, we stopped
            under the shade of some large trees, and dismounting at once discovered the object of
            our search about fifty yards distant, at the corner of a large building. This was the
            residence of Don Juan Urquida, the proprietor of the hacienda and large estates
            adjoining, and formerly governor of the State. That no time might be lost, Dr. Webb
            immediately set to work with his hammers and cold chisels to cut off some pieces from
            the huge mass of iron before us. This he found to be an undertaking 458 CHIHUAHUA * of
            great labor, in consequence of the extreme tenacity and hardness of the mass. After an
            hour's work, with a man to assist him, he succeeded in cutting off three or four small
            pieces, which did not altogether weigh an ounce, and were barely sufficient for an
            analysis. Five chisels having been broken, the Doctor had to desist from his labors,
            much to our regret, as we were desirous to obtain some specimens for cabinets. While
            this was going on, I took a couple of sketches of the mass, showing opposite sides, and
            also took mea- surements ; but the form was so irregular that these measurements can
            only aid in conveying an idea ap- proximately of its bulk. Its greatest height is forty-
            six inches ; greatest breadth thirty-seven inches ; cir- cumference in thickest part
            eight feet three inches. Its weight, as given me by Senor Urquida, is thirty- ht
            quintals, two arrobas, three libras, which, at one hundred pounds to the arroba, would
            be equiv- alent to three thousand eight hundred and fifty-three pounds. This meteorite
            is very irregular in form, as the rnvi- t3 drawing shows ; and one side is filled with
            deep ties, generally round, and of various dimensions. These cavities were doubtless
            formed when the mass was cool- ing. At its lower part, as it now stands, is a project-
            ing leg, quite similar to the one on the meteorite we aw at Tucson, and which I have
            described. The back or broadest part is less jagged than the other portions, and
            contains fewer cavities, yet, like the rest, is very irregular.* • From, the various
            inquiries made at Guajuquilla and attlie Haci- TO THE RIO FLORIDO, 459 While we were at
            work, Senor Urqurda, the younger, the brother of Don Juan, came out. Having no letters
            of introduction to him, I showed him a ;?ene- enda de ConcepcioD, I learned of the
            existence of meteorites, or masses of native iron, in several places. Of tliose near
            tlie former place, of which Dr, Wehb went in search, there is no doubt Some of them are
            very large masses, partially buried in the earth ; while others are less than the one
            described. There is one at San Greoforio, about fifteen leagues distant ; and it is
            reasonable to suppose from their proximity, that these several masses fell to the earth
            on the bursting of one and the same meteor. For the information of such of my readers as
            are not fanfiliar with the history of these phenomena, I will observe, in the words of a
            distin- uished philosopher, that "Shooting stars, fire-balls, and meteoric stones,
            regarded with great probability, as small masses moving with planet- ary velocity, and
            revolving in obedience to the laws of general gravity m conic sections around the sun.
            "When these masses meet the earth in their course, and are attracted by it, they enter
            within the limits of 5Ur atmosphere in a luminous condition, and frequently let fall
            more or less strongly heated stony fragments, covered with a shining black crust." *
            Another distinguished writer, Kaemtz,f after examhiing the several liypotheses, for the
            origin of these igneous meteors, arrives at imilaronclusions to those of Baron Humboldt.
            "A great number of observations," he says, '.' prove that, besides the large celestial
            bodies, there are small ones that move in space, such as points and luminous trains,
            which astronomers have often seen traversing the field of their telescopes. These
            miUions of asteroids moving round the sun, become visible when they are ignited by
            entering the terrestrial atmosphere." With regard to the masses of meteoric iron, many
            instances are • recorded where they have been known to fall to the earth on the burst-
            ing of meteoj-s, and have been carefully examined and analyzed by phi* losophers. They
            present the same character, both in form and in their hemical composition ; metallic
            iron predominating, with a few parts of Biekel. « The connection of meteoric stones,"

            former being known to be projected from the latter with such force as to penetrate from
            ten to fif- teen feet into the earth — has been proved, among many other instances, in
            the fall of aerolites at Barbatan, in the Department of Landes (24th of July, 1790), at
            Siena (16th of June, 1T94), at "Weston, in Connecticut (14th of December, 180V), and at
            Juvenas, in the Department of Ar- deche (loth June, 1821). Meteoric stones are sometimes
            thrown from dark clouds suddenly formed in a clear sty, and fall with a noise resem-
            bling thmden Whole districts have occasionally been covered with thousands of
            fragmentary masses, of uniform character but unequal magnitude, that have been hurled
            from one of those moving clouds- The great meteoric mass which fell in Siberia in 1V71,
            described by Pallas, was regarded by the Tartars as a sacred object fellen from hea-
            ven. Analogous masses have been found in Bohemia, Ilungary, the Cape of Good Hope,
            Mexico, Peru,'Senegal, Baffin's Bay, etc. The iron is full of cavities, filled with more
            or less perfect crystals of olinne ; wdien these crystals are removed, the residue still
            contains 90 per cent, of iron, a certain percentage of nickel, and the rest needs
            scarcely to be taken into account."* Of the meteoric masses found in Mexico, Baron
            Humboldt gjves the following account- " In the environs of Durango, is found the enor-
            mous mass of malleable iron and nickel, which is of the identical com- position of the
            aerolites which fell in Hungary, in 1151- This mass is affirmed to weigh upwards of 1900
            myriogrammes (41,p33 pounds). Another mass was discovered in Zacatecas, of the weight of
            97 myno- grammes (2140 pounds)." The exterior character of this was found by him to be
            entirely analogous to the malleable iron described by Pallas.f A collection of
            meteorites has been made by Professor Shepard, oi Amherst College, which is already said
            to embrace two hundred speci- mens from more than a hundred difierent localities. Among
            them is one from Newberry, South Carolina, weighing 58 pounds. Another mass * Kaemtz

            inqui- ries about the mass of iron. He said it was originally of malleable iron
            weigliing nine pounds, was found in November, 1852, in digging a ditoli near Cayuga
            Bridge, on Seneca River, N. Y. It measured four incbes in diameter and seven inches in
            lenortb: and what adds to the interest of tliis, is the fact that but a few miles from
            wLereit was found, a meteorite fell in 1827.* There is anotliev interesting account of
            the discovery of a meteorite m the town of Charlotte, North Carolina. In this case a
            whizzing noise was heard in the air by several pei-sons, accompanied by a commotion in
            the atmosphere, and the next moment a stone struct near them, "with a dull heavy jar of
            the ground" On examination, the meteoric mass referred to was discovered. The people of
            the town were alarmed by " a sudden explosion, followed at short intervals by two other
            reports, and by a rumbling in the air. The sounds were distinct, and continued for more
            than half a minute-" This meteor was seen through 250 miles.f It is to be hoped that
            Professor Shepard, into whose hands this me- teorite has been placed, will give the
            scientific world the results of his extensive study of these most interesting phenomena.
            Before closing this note, I will remark, that early in the evening of the 1st of June,
            the day we left San Isabel in California* a brilliant me- teor was seen by us all,
            passing from west to east. Another which sur- passed in brilliancy, in the size of its
            mass, the length of its fiery train, and the time of its duration any that I ever
            -witnessed, was seen about 8 o'clock in the morning, between the loth and 20th October,
            1852. This occurj-ed a few days before we reacled Chihuahua, and passed from west to
            east over two thirds of the horizon, at the south. On reading Ringgold Barracks, near
            Camai-go, a few weeks after, Major Paul, the commanding officer at that post, informed
            me that he saw the same me- teor, which passed to- the north of tjiem, and heard it
            explode. As it doubtless dropped on the open, woodless plains of Texas, which are now so
            much traversed, it is to be hoped that the masses which then fell lay be discovered. *

            stands. It was brought hither with the design of putting it in a blacksmith's shop, to
            be used as an anvil, although it had never been so employed. An attempt was made to
            reduce it, by building a large fire around it, and heating it to a white heat. ' But so
            intense was the heat from so ■ large a mass, that the workmen could not approach it, and
            all their labor was lost. The expense of this ope- ration was more than one hundred
            dollars, and resulted in obtaining a piece of the metal large enough to work into a pair
            of spurs. On the top, which is quite smooth, is an inscription bearing the date 1600 ;
            but I was unable to make out a single word of it, so much has it been defaced by
            hammering and the addition of many crosses. It is said that the inscription gave some
            account of its re- moval. Senor Urquida invited us into his house, to give us the
            particulars of the weight of the mass as esti- mated by his brother. We accepted his
            invitation, and were conducted into a very handsome suite of apartments. Here we met
            several gentlemen, all of whom were of the higher class, extremely affable in their
            manners, and in their conversation showing much intellifijence. Every thino; within and
            around indicated an air of comfort such as I had seen in no part of tne country, save in

            on tlie ground tliat we had breakfasted before leaving, and that it was necessary to
            rejoin our party on the Rio Florido without delay. Taking leave of our polite friends,
            we pursued our journey across the plateau, and reached the Hacienda del, Rio Florido,
            nine miles distant, at three o'clock, where we found the party already encamped. Several
            mules were taken sick to-day in conse- [ quence of the greenness of the corn (maize)
            they had eaten ; and one of them died, notwithstanding every effort to save him. This
            place consists of a large hacienda with a col- onnade of stone, the capitals of the
            columns being in the Moorish style. It stands on the margin of the plateau, overlooking
            the valley of the river, and has a very picturesque appearance. Adjoining this building

            hour or more, we set off, leaving an arriero to continue the search. A few hours after,
            the arriero overtook us with the missing animal, which he found concealed in the inner

            had determined to avoid night travel when it could possibly be avoided, as we bad gained
            nothing by it. The roads are excellent, and we might go on for twen- ty miles without
            meeting a rock or gully ; but the next moment we might disable the train by plunging
            into one of these places worn by the rain, or by upsetting in some shelving place. There
            are no bridges in the country, except over the acequias ; and repairs are never made on
            the roads. If a flood washes a portion away, or it is otherwise rendered unsafe to
            travel, the place is simply avoided and a new route taken. La Noria is merely a well
            with a large hacienda for the raising of cattle, but with no ground for tillage. As it
            is the only place between tlie Rio Florido and Cerro Gordo where there is a certainty of
            finding "■vG water, it is the general stopping-place for all passmg trains. The

            camp was called at an early hour ; and before the sun bad shed his first rays upon us,
            we had breakfasted and were moving forwards. Our course lay over a broad plain with a
            superb road, not surpassed by the best wrought turnpike. To the east, the view was
            limited by a low range of hills about ten miles distant; while in other directions,

            I accordingly presented my letter from Gen- eral Trias to the Comandante, and requested
            liim to furnish me another escort throu£fh this State. He told Kie that the soldiers
            were at my service, but expressed his regrets that he had iiot the means of furnishing
            them with their subsistence even for the short march re- quired, and that for nearly a
            month he had not been able to give them money enough to purchase their daily food. As
            their pay was but two and a half reals (31 cents) day, and as this was the only
            difficulty, I at once offered to allow them this amount each, while they were with us,
            and the same for returning. The Co- oiandante, a very polite and gentlemanly man; made
            468 EIO FLORIDO many apologies for his straitened circumstances ; and he requested me to

            power. About three months before our arrival, this place was attacked by a band of a
            hundred and fifty Co- manches, and a large number of mules and cattle stolen. The

            that when this estate was at the ze- nith of its prosperity, a regiment of dragoons
            arrived from Spain and landed at Tampico. This regiment was one thousand strong, and of
            course the men did not bring their horses with them. The Colonel hap- pening to be a
            friend of the family of the proprietress, then a widow, she immediately sent him a
            thousand white horses as a present, for the use of his regiment. There was hardly a
            month's difference in the i these horses, and every one of them had been raised her
            estate. Novemher lth. The same open table-land c tinued to-day. On leaving, we descended
            gradually about six miles, when we found good water in a lagi '-'' again to a higl a the
            road side. We then ascended \ level for about twelve miles, by an easy slope. The whole
            plain was here covered with grass, but entirely destitute even of the smallest bushes.
            An occasional cactus or yucca rose now and then, to break the mono- tony of the broad
            plains. Sometimes they appeared in groups, and at a distance resembled men on horse-
            back or on foot. Often were scouts sent ahead to in- spect these mysterious-looking
            objects. Passed several large droves of horses, which rushed UsTarrative of tlie Texan

            at full speed as we drew near them. There-were no herdsmen with them; and it was a
            matter of surprise to see such herds ten or fifteen miles from any habitation. The best
            of these horses may be purchased for fifty dollars each, and ordinary ones for from
            eighteen to twenty dollars. We filled our water kegs at the laguna, and, after making
            altogether about twenty -one miles, encamped in the open plain near some mezquit bushes,
            for the sake of the fuel they afforded. Wood had been the most dif- ficult of all things
            to procure on our journey from El Paso. We gathered it from bushes as we came along ;
            and we often, as was the case this day, were governed in fixing our camp by proximity to
            it. Novemher 17th. Our route to-day lay over and among low hills with a stony road, but
            kept gradually descending towards the valley where we expected to encamp. Towards noon,
            herds of cattle and miljas (corn-fields) indicated our approach to a settlement ; and
            soon after, we rode into a town that glories in the extraordinary name of San Pedro del
            Galh (St. Peter of the Cock). Miserable and filthy as were many of the towns we had
            visited, this surpassed them all. The plaza seemed to be used as a great cattle-pen, and
            the streets as avenues to it. There was a general staring at us as we entered the place.
            Driving through it, we encamped on a level piece of ground just beyond, where we were
            soon surrounded by a number of anx- ious inquirers. As an evidence of the poverty of the
            place, we could buy neither eggs, fowls, nor vegetables ■nothing hut fnjoles, and corn
            for the animals. The town is supplied with water from a natural TO PARRAS 471 well,
            whence it is conducted into a long trough built of stone. Here the mules and cattle
            drank, the wo- men did their washing, the people in general per- formed their ablutions,
            and got their supply of water to drink. Bj tapping the fountain near its source, we got
            pure water. Novemher ISth. On leaving El Gallo (as it is often called for shortness) we
            entered some low hills, and soon after crossed a plain about twelve miles wide, when we
            reached a range of rocky hills with fantastic summits. Through defiles in these we

            the eye could reach. Lar fields of corn covered the bottom-lauds, and every thing
            indicated a high state of cultivation. This was the Yalley of the Rio Nasas, a beautiful
            stream about sixty yards in width that discharges itself into the Lake Cayman of the
            maps, but which is here known as the Laguna de Tlagualila, in the Bolson de Mapimi.
            Finding a rancho on its banks, where corn and a corral could be obtained, we encamped.
            Distance from El Gallo, twenty-five miles. The valley here is from a mile to a mile and
            a half in width, and has long been noted for the excellent quality of the cotton raised
            in it. The climate is said to be very mild, and admirably adapted for its cultiva- tion.
            In our journey to-day, I noticed for the first time several large fields of maize on the
            high grounds, with no water near. The soil is excellent on these plains ; and by
            planting the seed just before the rainy season, it comes to maturity rapidly; although
            the yield is less than when irrigation is employed, and the grain is of an inferior
            quality. The mezquit trees in this valley are larger than any seen on our route, being
            full twenty feet in height. Novemher Idth. Following the bank of the Rio Nasas for five
            or six miles, we kept on through several small villages and cultivated grounds, then
            turned suddenly to the east, and passed between two high liills with flat tops. After
            continuing about three TO PARRAS. 473 i i it %■ miles through a defile, we emerged into
            a broad plain, bounded on the east by a high range of mountains. This ]olain was about
            ten miles across ; after it we passed a second range, and beyond this another plain of
            six or eight miles more, which brought us to La Nona de Pedrecena a well with a wheel,
            distant twenty-seven miles from our starting place. Here is a church, ap- parently
            modern, with several furnaces for smelting silver ore. The town is surrounded by an
            adobe wall twelve feet high, outside of which are many houses in a state of decay. It
            has evidently been more populous than it is at present ; for not half the houses seem to
            be occupied. All the water used by the inhabitants is taken from the well. _ |H

            made a call on Don Tomas Pcdrecena, the proprietor of the place. I found him an
            intelligent and gentlemanly man ; and at my request he furnished us a scries of
            specimens of the ore from his silver mines in the vicinity. The place was originally
            founded by his grandfather, and had descended to the gentleman we now saw, who, on
            coming into possession, had leased the estate. The lessees had for several years
            abandoned the working -of the mines, and devoted themselves to working over the scoria
            and cinders which lay in the" hillocks near the town, and from which they were able by
            some improved process to extract a considerable amount of the precious metal. Senor
            Pedrecena took possession himself about six months before our visit, finding the place
            was fast running down. With this revival it has quite an air of business. Don Tomas.
            took us into the 474 EIO FLORIDO church, which is in good condition, and is hung with
            pretty goocl pictures of a large size. An advantage in these pictures wasj that the name
            of the subject was painted beneath each of them, a piece of information that would have
            been acceptable in the case of many others we had seen. . ■ By the advice of our friend,
            we here left the direct road, which he informed us was rough and hilly, with some bad
            arroyos to cross, where wagons were often disabled, and took that to Cuencame, about
            twenty miles distant, which we reached early in the afternoon. Cuencame or Quincame, was
            once a place of some importance, judging from its many well-built houses and churches.
            It has three of the latter, one of which, on the plaza, is quite an imposing edifice.
            The houses on the plaza are large, and plastered outside. The shops, of which there are
            many, are well filled with goods, and have a show of business. As the escort furnished
            us at Cerro G-ordo left us at La Noria, I called on the Prefect of Cuencame with the
            letter of General Trias, and requested him to fur- nish me another to El Alamo de
            Parras, or the first military post in the State of Coahuila. lie received me politely,
            and expressed a willingness to further my views as far as lay in his power. There were
            no sol- diers in ihQ place ; but *he agreed to procure for us seven reliable men, if I
            would allow them the usual pay of privates, and something extra for the corporal ; an
            offer which I readily accepted. He could not furnish them animals to ride, as there were
            but few in the place. Between here and Parras is the most dangerous 4 * TO PARKAS. 4T5 t

            Bolson de Mapimi is here, through which the Indians enter that portio]i of Mexico. The
            little heaps of stones surmounted by crosses, where murders have been committed by the
            Indians, are met with at every mile; and having got •along safe thus far, 1 did not feel
            disposed to risk the party and train, if an escort could be had. The present population
            of Cuencame is three thou- sand souls, as stated to me by the Prefect. It is a very, old
            place, and the Franciscans formerly had a con- vent her. It stands on a small stream,
            barely suffi- cient to. supply the wants of the people. There is no bottom-land near,
            which gives it a most dreary appear- ance. It is strictly a mining town, and has three
            smelting works in operation. We went into them, and procured specimens of the ores.
            November 2\st We were detained several hours waiting for our escort, so that we did not
            get off until eleven o'clock. Our course was now east over a bad road. After going about
            ten miles, we stopped at a well called La Noria Curena, an abandoned cattle hacienda.,
            near which was good grass, but no arable land. The well is covered with a handsome
            octagonal building, having wheel- work inside for raising the water ty mule power. " In
            an adjoining building we found the leathern buckets, which we rigged with some diffi-
            culty by attaching them to a broad leather band which passed over a horizontal wheel,
            and thence down into the well. On one side these buckets went down empty, and on the
            other came up filled. The water then fell into a reservoir, whence it was led to the
            out- y 476 RIO FLORIDO side into a trough of stone about four feet wide and a hundred in
            length. Here the animals were watered, though it was with some difficulty we could get
            the timid mules to drink from such a respectable-lookiug affair. The Indians attacked
            this place shortly before our arrival, took every mule and head of cattle, and drove off
            the inhabitants ; since which time it has been abandoned. November 2 2d The country had
            now become .very hilly and rough, with bad roads. On descending a hill, a linch-pin was
            thrown from one of the wagons, letting the axle down with so much force, that the end of
            it was broken off and spoiled. Having some pieces of hard wood in the train, the end was
            cut off and a piece spliced on, a very difficult job, causing a detention of four hours.
            To ease this axle as much as possible, a portion of the load of this wagon was trans-
            ferred to the others. We now proceeded cautiously, the road still winding among
            mountains, and at eight o'clock p. M. reached the river Buenaval having made twenty-five
            miles. This is a small stream which rises in the State of Zacatecas, and, running north,
            empties into the Lagana de Parras, in the Bolspn de.Mapimi. It has no bottom-land where
            we crossed it ; and hence is destitute of the cotton-wood trees which are so fying to
            the eye amid the general barrenness. 6 November 23d My intention on leaving this morn-
            ing was to go to the Alamo de Parras, about thirty- five miles distant ; but an hour or
            two after we had started, our spliced axle-tree gave out, which compelled us to stop at
            the Norm de Pozo Ocdvo, a well similar to that of Curena. On examination we found it

            readily supplied with our limited materials. It was, nevertheless, effected by making a
            false axle extending two thirds the length of the old one, to which it was fastened with
            pegs and raw hide. One wheel was consequently six inches further back than the other.
            Near by were some fields of corn cultivated with- out irrigation, which looked very
            well. About a month before our visit, the Comanches made a de- scent here, took all the
            cattle (about forty head) and a number of mules, and killed three men who had them in
            charge. Only three men now remained at the hacienda, which they intended to abandon in a
            few days. Novemher 2Uh. Our march to-day was all the way over the hills, and through
            long narrow valleys sepa- rating high ridges of mountains. The road was stony and rough
            most of the way ; the remainder, a deep sandy loam. The dust raised by a strong wind,
            which blew directly behind us, so filled the air, that objects could not be seen twenty
            feet ahead. The wind drew through those defiles with great force, raising clouds of dust
            independent of that caused by the mules and • '"agons. This was the most disagreeable
            day's journey ve had had, and the most tedious ; for we did not reach the Alamo de
            Parras till two hours after sunset, having made thirty miles. Soon after our arrival, I
            called on the Alcalde of the town with the letter of General Trias, and made a request
            for an escort, as the men from Cuencame had not engaged to go any further. He expressed
            a desire to serve us ; but having no troops, he said he could only 478 RIO FLORIDO give
            us a guard of citizens, on mj paying the custom- ary charge. This I readily consented
            to, and request- ed that seven mounted men might be placed at my disposal. The Alcalde
            said it would not be possible _ for him to find men who would be ready to start m the
            morning, as it was then late. We were, therefore, obliged to remain over a day. November
            25 f A. This town consists of a street a mile or more in length, well lined on both
            sides with neat adobe buildings, most of which are colored or whitewashed. Some streets
            running at right angles contain a few houses. The plaza and church are quite ordinary
            and not in keeping with the rest of the town, which is altogether more cleanly and
            business-like than any we had seen since leaving Chihuahua. Ten leagues distant are the
            Yiesca silver mines, the ore from which is smelted here. In my walks about the town and
            its vicinitv, I observed more cultivated ml 7 S ds than I had seen elsewhere. To the
            level plain full ten miles wide, intersected with irrigat- ing canals in every
            direction. Cotton is cultivated on this plain to a considerable extent, and is found to
            do well. I procured some samples of the product, a ready market for which is found at
            Saltillo. Novemher 2Gth. On the arrival of the citizen guard this morning, we again set
            out. Our course lay east over the plain mentioned yesterday, which did not con- tain a
            tree or a bush. On passing this we entered a mountain defile, and soon after reached the
            hacienda called La Peiia (The Eock). This is simply a well with one large building and a
            cattle-pen, without any arable land. It formerly possessed large numbers of TO PAERAS.
            479 cattle, whicli grazed on the plain ; but no animals can now be kept there, on
            account of the Indians, who are complete masters of the country, notwithstanding the
            populous towns in every direction. We did not stop here, intending to reach EI Pozo,
            three leagues further: but in passing the rocky defile, one of the wagons broke down,
            which made it impossible to proceed as There was no alternative but to empty it of it
            was. them among and lock the disabled wheel. In this manner we reach- ed El Pozo late in
            the evening. As we approached, our horsemen in advance were hailed from the walls ; and
            by the time they came up, twenty armed men were at the gate to receive them. We by this
            time found the nights very cold, which rendered it necessary to have fires to warm
            ourselves when fuel could be obtained. This night in particular was exceedingly cold. El
            Pozo (The Deep Well) is a large hacienda in- closed with a wall full twenty feet high,
            resembling a castle or a prison ; and is a noted resort for the Co- manches and the
            Lipans, in passing to and from the Bolson de Mapimi, where they dwell. They pass every
            few days, and we were told that a large baud stopped here but two days before. On that
            day they attacked a train of pack-mules and donkeys, and completely cut it up. The men
            with it were missing, and it was not known whether they had been killed, or had made
            their escape to the- mountains. It was at a band of Indians received a chastisement from
            a detachment from Colonel Doniphan's command, when this 480 RIO FLOEIDO passing through

            believed them to be Mexicans. I have been often told that they will not attack a party
            of Americans, when they know them to be such ; as in their contests with them, they
            usually get the worst of it. Novemher 2fh. On starting this morning, we found addition
            of six or eight Mexicans, men and ) to our party, who were going to Parras. Our road
            wound around hills and across deep arroyos. Numer- * " Two days before our arrival, a
            party of Lipan Indians, upon one of their predatory excursions, had stolen from a
            hacienda, near Parras, several hundred mules and horses, and killed several men. The
            pro- prietor, Don Manuel de Ibarra, applied to Captain Reid of our regiment (who was
            then ahead of us 'ith Lieut. Col. Milcheirs party) for aid against these Indians. The
            Captain, one of the most gallant officers, toot but eight men along, and, accompanied by
            the Don himself, went back to El Pozo, where the ludiaus, on their march to the
            mountains, had to pass. They had hid themselves in a corral, to await the arrival of the
            Indians. Quite unexpectedly, about twenty of our vanguard came very early this morning
            to El Pozo, and increased their party to thirty men. Soon afterwards the Indians
            appeared, from forty to fifty war- riors. When our men rushed from the corral on
            horseback to attack them, the Indians (supposing them to be Mexicans) received them with
            sneering and very contemptuous provocations ; and their confidence m their bows and
            arrows was increased, when the Americans, firing their rifles from horseback, killed
            none at the first charge. Bat as soon as our men ah'ghted, and took good aim with their
            rifles, the Indians fell on all sides. Nevertheless, they fought most desperately, and
            did not retire till half of them were dead or wounded. But at last they had to run for
            their lives, and leave all their dead and all their booty behmd. Besides their stolen
            stock, thirteen prisoners, Mexican women and chil- dren, whom they bad carried along,
            were retaken, and released from the brutality of their savage masters. Fifteen Indians
            were lying dead on the field." — Dr. Widizemis's Memoir, p. 71. I /■ TO PARRAS. 481 1'

            reminded us of the prox- imity of the savage and of th-e murders he had com- mitted. On
            both sides of the road, three or four miles distant, fan chains of mountains. After a
            gradual ascent -of ten miles, we saw teneath us a broad valley ; and upon the right of
            this, at the base of the moun- tains, lay the town oi Parras. The whitened walls of its
            houses, its steeples, and the long rows and clusters of cotton- wood trees, presented an
            agreeable contrast to the bold ruo:£2:ed mountains in the back-ground. Until quite near
            the town, the plain is barren and not susceptible of cultivation. It was after sunset
            when we entered the place, and we at once drove to a sort of caravanserai, which we
            entered with the whole train. The mules were placed in a corral adjoining. Four of us
            quartered ourselves in a small apartment in the court, the rest remained in tents. ■ 482

            our wagons. One wheel and an axle had to be made new tlirougliout. The delay was longer
            than was needed for the work, in conse- quence of the loss of two days by the
            drunkenness of our most important, mechanics. We had to submit quietly to this
            imposition, as no others could be found. The time passed heavily, as there was but
            little of interest in or about the town, and the sight-seeing was soon accomplished.
            Parras is the best built town we had yet seen in the country. Many of the houses are of
            two stones, being quite spacious, with, cotirts in the centre, and TO SALTILLO. 483 +
            built with mucli taste. They possess, too, a degree of comfort, and even luxmy, not
            found in the modern houses of the country. It is an old settled place, and has always
            been noted for the excellence of its wine and brandy. A species of wild vine was found
            here by the first settlers, whence its name;* they also brought with them the vites
            vinifera of Asia, which flourished well. The extensive cultivation of the grape, for
            which the position of the town is admirably adapt- e(J, as well as the extent of arable
            land near, drew together a large and highly respectable population. Although now much
            reduced in their worldly means, there are many old families remaining, who possess all
            the dignity and elegance of manner which always cha- racterized the native Spaiiiard.
            The town extends for a couple of miles along the side of a hill.' The smaller vineyards
            run along the declivity, the larger ones beyond the town, on the plain. The hill, which
            consists of a porous limestone, abounds in water, which is collected in tanks, and
            conducted by acequias through the vineyards and the principal streets 'of the town.
            Besides these acequias ere are numerous wells ; in fact, every house of any th extent
            has its own well within its court. When the town has supplied itself, the remainder is
            conducted by aqueducts or ditches off to the plains, where it is all absorbed in
            irrigating, first, the gardens and vine- yards, and beyond these the fields of wheat and
            maize. So admirable and economical a use of water I have never before seen. Parra a vine

            encompassed with gardens and orchards, in which we saw pomegranate, fig, pear, and other
            trees growing with great luxnri- xnce. On the hill back of the town, I saw for the first
            time plantations of the mafjuey (cigcive Americanct) the leaves of which were from six
            to seven feet in length. They are planted in rows, and surrounded by a hedge of the
            same, making a most formidable breast- work against both man and beast It is from these
            plants that the pulque is made." We had seen the * The sap of the maguey is obtained by
            making an incision in the central leaves or heart of the plant, which incision is
            converted into a kind of reservoir for the collection of the juice, by drawing the
            lateral . leaves close together and tying their extremities. " This is the true
            vegetable spring, which keeps running for two or three months, and from which the Indian
            draws three or four times a day. We may jiulge of the quickness or slowness of the
            motion of the juice by the quantity of honey extracted from the maguey at different
            times of the day. A foot commonly yields, in twenty-four hours, four cubic decimetres
            (or two hundred and forty-two cubic inches, English), equal to eight quartlllos. Of this
            total quantity they obtain tliree quscr- tillos at sunrise, two at mid-day, and three at
            six in the evening. A very vigorous plant sometimes yields fifteen quartillos, or four
            hundred and fifty-four cubic inches, English, per day, for from four to five months,
            which amounts to the enormous volume of more than eleven hundred cubic decimetres, or
            sixty-seven thousand one hundred and thirty cubic inches. This abundance of juice,
            produced by a single maguey of scarcely a metre and a half in heiirht, or four and nine
            tenths feet, is so much more astonishing, as the agave plantations are in the most arid
            grounds, and frequently on banks of rocks hardly covered with vegetable earth. In a
            barren soil, the Indian calculates the product of each maguey at one hundred and fifty
            bottles, and the value of the pulque furnished in a day at from ten to twelve sols. The

            Chihuahua, Sonora, and California; but nowhere does it attain the size which it reaches
            in these plantations. ■ " The cultivation of the maguey has real advantages over the
            culti- vation of maize, grain, and potatoes. This plant, with firm and vigorous leaves,
            is neither affected by drought nor hail, nor the excessive cold which prevails in winter
            on the higher Cordilleras of Mexico. The stalk perishes after efflorescence. If we
            deprive it of the central leaves it withers, after the" juice, which nature appears to
            have destined to the increase of the haiiipe is entirely exhausted. An infinity of
            shoots then spring from the root of the decayed plant ; for no plant multiplies with
            greater facility. An arpent of ground contains from twelve hundred to thirteen hundred
            maguey plants. If the field is of old cultivation, w« may calculate that a twelfth or
            fourteenth of these plants yields honey annually, A proprietor who plants from thirty
            thousand to forty thou- sand maguey is sure to establish tiie fortune of his children;
            but it re- quires patience and courage to follow a species of cultivation which only
            begins to grow lucrative at the end of fifteen years. In a good soil, the agave enters
            on its efflorescence at the end of five years ; and in a poor soil no harvest can be
            expected in less than eighteen years. Although the rapidity of the vegetation is of the
            utmost consequence for the Mexi- can cultivators, they never attempt artificially to
            accelerate the devel- opment of the hampe, by mutilating the roots or watering them with
            warm water. It is discovered that by these means, w*hich weaken the pJant, the
            confluence of juice towards the centre is sensibly diminished. A maguey plant is
            destroyed if, misled by felse appearances, the Indian makes the incision long before the
            flowers would have maturely devel- oped themselves," — Thompsoii's Alcedo, " The juice
            of the agave has a very agreeable sour taste. It easily ierments on account of the
            mucilaofe and sugar which it contains. To accelerate the fermentation they add a little
            old and acid pulque. The operation is terminated in three or four days. The vinous
            beverage, which resembles cider, has* an odor of putrid meat extremely disagree- able ;
            but the Europeans who have been able to get over the aversion which this fcetid odor
            inspires, prefer the pulque to ever)' other liquor. They consider it as a stomachic,
            strengthening, and especially very nutri- tive; and it is recommended to lean persons.

            belonging at present to Don Arguire, called the '■Hacienda Arrtha" or the upper
            hacienda, to dis- tinguish it from the "" Haciendo J.etq/o," or lower haci- enda, of Don
            Manuel de Ibarra, four miles distant. This is one of the most extensive and valuable
            estates in Coahuila. Its chief products are wine and wheat. The vineyards which surround
            it, extend twelve hundred varas (3240 feet) into the plain, while beyond these are
            extensive fields of wheat and maize. As it seldom rains here, the cultivation of. the
            grape as well as of the cereals, depends wholly upon irrigation ; yet there is no river
            to supply it. In the rear of this hacienda, about half a mile distant, the water oozes
            from numer- ous springs in the side of a hill ; which unite at the base and form a small
            stream. This stream as it passes over the porous rocks, receives constant additions. As
            the descent is considerable, the whole of this water is controlled, and conveyed through
            a stone aqueduct, first to a flouring mill, and then to the vineyards, gar- dens, and

            in the village of Hocotitlan, to the north of Toluca, at the foot of a mountain almost
            as elevated as the Nevada of this name. Tliey affirm that the excellent quality of this

            also on a taste of the soil communicated to tlie juice, accordino- to the fields in

            fall, there is suifi- cient power to cany other mills, before it reaches the plain where
            it. is to be absorbed by the soil. A portion of this prolific supply, is led by an
            acequia through the town. M I made a visit to this hacienda, with several gen- tlemen of
            my party-; where we were politely received by the superintendent, who conducted us
            through the establishment. The wine vaults are built of adobe, with walls about
            twenty-five feet in height. By an inscription on the rafters, it appears to have been
            roof- ed over in the year 1775 ; yet the timber did not ap- pear to be more than ten
            years old. The building is said, however, to be much older, the rafters being a portion
            of the renewed edifice. The several kinds of wine and brandy were arranged in very large
            casks on both sides of the vault, the whole exhibiting great cleanliness and order. The
            wine, both white and red, that I tasted, was far superior to that made at El Paso. About
            ten thousand gallons are made here annually, for which there is a good market in
            Coahuila and the adjoining States. The amount of wheat raised on the estate, is about
            two thousand fanegas, or 5250 bushels ; all of The which is converted into flour at the

            belonging to the establishment, are but one story in- height. Extensive improvements are
            now going on, with the addition of new buildings ; these are of adobe, plastered over
            with mortar, and hard finished, and have a very beautiful appearance. This hacienda was

            is another large wine manufacturer in Parras, Don Jesus Campus, whose establishment we
            also visit- ed, and which like the former, was kept in fine order. I bought a keg of
            wine of him, which was said to be ten years old, and a superior article. It was put up
            with great care ; yet, on arriving at New-York, it was found to be sour. All others who
            have attempted to transport this wine to the United States, have been equally
            unsuccessful. Parras contains three churches, which were shown to us by the cura, Juan
            B. Bobadilla, 'a courteous and intelligent gentleman. Two of them abound in pictures of
            a higher standard than any we had seen. More care, too, was taken of them, as well as of
            the churches, which were in good condition, and exhibited none of those symptoms of
            decay prevalent every where, except in Chihuahua. The cura manifested much interest in
            scientific pur- suits, and was quite desirous to know what we had col- lected. He
            presented us with some specimens of min- erals, reptiles, and insects, and promised to
            send me a larger collection as soon as he could procure them. I have omitted to speak of
            two fine Alamedas, the fashionable promenades of the town. . These are beau- tifully
            shaded with long rows of large cotton-wood trees, while flowers and lesser plants

            in the afternoon, and proceeded as far as the Hacienda ahajo or San Lorenzo, a large and
            elegant establish- ment surrounded by lines and clusters of old cotton- woods. Vineyards
            and corn-fields extended far and wide over the plain. The owner, Don Manuel de Ibar- ra,
            being absent, we did not visit the interior. The whole constitutes a large village. It
            derives its sup- ply of water from springs in the hills. Don Manuel treated General Wool

            hilly and tor- tuous. We made twenty miles ; which brought us to a cluster of houses
            known as the Cienega Grande (Great Marsh), belonging to Don Rey de Guerrero. Fields of

            with low hills and valleys alternating, and intersected with arroyos which required much
            care in crossing. Passed several cornfields, with which exception all was barren and
            desert-like. At sunset reached Yequeria a hacienda near a spring, twenty- five miles
            from our starting place. As we passed along, I noticed many gigantic yuccas growing in
            the form of trees with trunks and branches. The different species of yucca, of which
            frequent mention has been made, form a conspicuous feature m the vegetation. They
            present a great variety of foli- age, some narrow and grass-like, and others rigid and
            firm enough to serve for a " Spanish bayonet," a pop- ular name given to the larger
            kinds. All are furnished with a sharp hard point at the end of the leaf, which is
            capable of inflicting a severe wound, and which soon teaches the incautious traveller to
            give them a wide berth. While some have no stem at all, others have a trunk twenty -five
            or thirty feet high and from two to three feet in diameter. The largest specimens we saw
            were near Parras, where the table-lands are cov- ered with them. This species throws out
            at the top ten or a dozen branches which are bent in all possible : directions. A plain
            covered with yuccas presents a beautiful appearance when in flower with their pure white
            blossoms arranged in pyramidal spikes several feet in length. The Mexicans and Indians
            put the different species to various domestic uses. The leaves of the narrower kinds are

            Mexicans latii-os. These are about the size and shape of the hanaiia, and when fully

            are produced is roasted and eaten under name of but y and insipid. One of our party saw

            boiling. The roots of a narrow-leaved species called amole are used, instead of soap,
            for wash- ing clothes; bruised between stones, they aflbrd a mucilage when rubbed upon
            the clothes, which seems to possess considerable detergent properties. The root is
            generally kept for sale in the towns, and, where soap is so very dear, affords an
            economical substitute. December Qth. Our intention was to reach the rancho of San Juan
            to-day. Soon after leaving, we saw through an opening in the hills on our left, about a
            mile distant, the Hacienda de Patos. This place is the property of Don Jacobo Sanchez,
            and is said to be the finest in the State of Coahuila. This gentleman is said to be the
            owner of three quarters of the landed pro- perty in the State, including several large
            and valuable haciendas, well stocked with cattle, mules, and horses. He has lost large
            numbers by the Indians, and, I am told, has made a claim on the United States for a mil-
            lion and a half of dollars as an' indemnification for these losses. Yet he takes no
            pains to protect his property, not even arming his herdsmen, and never pursues the
            Indians or makes any efforts to recover what he has lost. In entering into a compact
            with Mexico for the protection of her frontier, the United States certainly expected
            either the Mexican govern- ment or the proprietors to do something for their own
            protection. The lands of Don Jacobo extend in a con- tinuous line more than a hundred
            miles. Such a land- holder could well afford to support a body of expert riflemen or
            rangers, who should be always on the alert -'iV TO SALTILLO. 493 I f and pursue the
            Indians whenever found on his domain. Mules are extremely plentiful here, and are valued
            at twenty dollars a head on an average. I presume Don Jacobo estimates his mules in his
            claim on the United States at from fifty to sixty dollars a head. This is about the
            advance that Americans put upon their property, of whatever nature, when the government
            is to pay for it ; and we can hardly expect the more moderate than our own citizens. One
            of our wagons broke down to-day and so injured the axle-tree that it would not retain
            its wheel. It was, therefore, taken off and the axle sustained by a long pole. Our road
            ascended gradually until we reached an elevated plain with high mountains around us.
            Passed several ranchos, with large fields of maize. These fields were in the depressions
            of the plain, and derived sustenance from the drainage of the moun- tains. The corn
            looked as well as when artificially ated. Among the villages passed was one ex-
            clusively of Peons. It consisted of a cluster of ex- tremely rude dwellings or huts
            around a square, many of which were built entirely of the yucca tree. Its trunk set
            upright formed the walls and* doors, while its leaves, placed on poles, after the manner
            of thatching, made the roof. Want and wretchedness were stamped Tipon these rude hovels,
            as well as on the poor cre- tures who occupied them. Ye tried to buy corn-stalks here,
            but they had Done for sale, which obliged us to move on. When opposite San Juan, a

            none, although there were large corn- fields near. It was, therefore, necessary for us
            to push on and endeavor to reach Encantada ten miles further. The road proving very
            good, we got along very well after dark by driving cautiously, and arrived at our place
            of destination in safety — a place rendered famous from its connection with the
            campaigns of General Taylor and the battle of Buena Vista. Distance trav- J elled
            to-day, thirty-two miles. December Itli. Before I had risen this morning, I was aroused
            by the arrival of a courier bringing me dispatches from Washington, and letters
            announcing the F arrival of Major Emory and his corps of engineers at Rinsrsfold
            Barracks, Texas. Encantada (Enchanted) is a small village, where the American army under
            General Taylor was - en- camped at the time of the approach 5f Santa Ana with his army
            of twenty-five thousand men, pre- vious to the battle of Buena Vista. Not finding the
            position an advantageous one, he fell back and took position at Angostura, the narrowest
            portion of the valley leading to and beyond Saltillo, which is six miles distant. This
            valley or pass lies between ridges of mountain five or six miles apart, which ap- proach
            towards the north-east, until at Angostura the space is not more than two miles. The

            which takes its rise at Encantada ; but at times, after heavy rains, it is so much
            swollen that it has cut for itself a deep bed, with perpendicular banks, from twenty to
            thirty feet deep. This bed is quite inaccessible from above, except in a few places.
            These deep gullies or ravines are called barrancas, and are peculiar to the country. The
            tena- city of the soil prevents it from crumbling, except at the base, where the water
            washes it away. The upper portion then projects, until it has become so much undermined
            that it cannot sustain itself, when it breaks off, leaving perpendicular walls. These
            barrancas ex- tend for more than a mile above and below the nar- row pass. They also
            intersect various parts of the bottom, rendering it impossible for a body of troops to
            traverse it. Hence all the operations were confined to the plateau above, which extends
            to the eastern range of mountains. The battery of Colonel Washing- ton was stationed
            between the barrancas and a spur of the plateau, a narrow pass some sixty or eighty /eet
            in width. The road leads directly through this pass ; and on reaching it, we stopped
            within the redoubt thrown up hy Colonel W. I told the men to fasten their teams, and all
            that felt disposed to visit the battle field to do so. We walked up HDne of the steep
            hills or spurs, and reached the plateau, where the party strolled about in all
            directions as far as the mountains. I had a plan of the battle with me, which enabled us
            to find the positions occupied by our several bodies of troops. Many relics were found,
            such as grape shot, hullets of lead and copper, gun-flints, fragments of fi 496 ■ PARRAS
            gun-locks, cap trimmings, etc., also a few fragments of human bones. I took two sketches
            of the battle field, one looking south, the other towards Saltillo. About two miles
            distant is the small village of Buena Vista. The Mexicans call the place where the
            battle was fought Angostura, which means a narroio pass. Leaving this ever-memorable
            spot, we pushed for- ward, and at two o'clock reached Saltillo. The town is completely
            hidden from view until one reaches the brink of the hill in front of it. We drove at
            once to a court-yard on one of the main streets, where we found accommodations for the
            whole party. The ani- mals were placed in a corral near by. We had been in town but a
            short time when our arrival became known ; for our train of six large wag- ons, five

            proceeding twelve miles entered the famous Rinconada j[ass. The road now became very
            uneven with a continuation of hills and valleys, while mountains rugged and lofty rose
            either side: the defile ging about miles in width. Passed a monument erected by the
            ladies of Saltillo on the spot where some Americans had been murdered by robbers. After
            making about enty-five miles reached a cho in the pass called Los Muertos (The Dead),
            where, just '■) encamped. A small stream flowed by, lined with ge cotton-wood December

            feet above the level of the sea, so that all wrapped them- selves in blankets or
            overcoats. Our escort, who put on their gaudy scrapes, made a very picturesque
            appearance. Soon after leaving we reached a narrow and steep descent, where we were
            obliged to wait for a train that was coming up, before we could descend. Here the pass
            did not exceed five hundred yards in L width. Near this, on the left, is a spur of the
            moun- tain which overlooks and commands the defile, where General Ampudia erected a

            sketch of the magnificent defile. Far ahead, we could just perceive the picturesque
            summit of the Sierra Mitra (Mitre Mountain), so named from the o of the summits in the
            rang mitre. The place selected for the Me can batterj would- have greatly embarrassed
            our army had it been maintained ; but after the fall of Monterey, it was abandoned. Soon
            after descending this hill, we reached the rancho of Rinconada in a curious little nook
            in the mountain resembling a horseshoe, which gives its name to the pass. From the
            number of fruit trees and cul- tivated grounds it had doubtless been once a thriving
            place. Every thing now seemed to be fast going to ruin. We continued to descend the
            whole day ; yet, owing to the roughness of the road, and our three- wheeled wagon, we
            were obliged to drive with great caution, that we might not further disable ourselves.
            Our escort pointed out to us as we progressed another rancho, which was attacked by a
            band of Indians a few months before, and all the inmates murdered. We were unable to
            reach Monterey as we had hoped to do, and it was long after dark when we reached the
            village of Santa Catarma, at the base of the Sierra Mitra and about twenty miles from
            the Rin- conada, where we encamped. December 12th. Soon after leaving, we passed the
            Molino de Jesus Maria, a large flouring mill, and shortly after reached the Loma de
            Independencia upon which stands the Bishop's palace, so celebrated in the opera- 502
            SALTILLO ? tions of the American army during the investment of Monterey. Having now
            reached the valley in which stands the city, we passed by walled inclosures wli among a
            variety of fruit and ornamental trees, we saw some loaded with oranges and lemons. Stone
            houses with high thatched roofs, surrounded by pretty gar- dens with more of an air of
            comfort than any we had seen, lined the approach to the. city. On entering, we drove to
            a corral ; and after putting up the wagons and animals, we- took up our quarters at
            Coindrc Hotel ; a spacious building with a large court, in the style of the country. One
            might have imagined that another bombardment was going on from the roar of cannon, as we
            entered the town ; but it proved to be nothing more formidable than the celebration of
            the day of the " Holy Lady of Guadalupe," one of the greatest festivals of the country.
            December 13th. Lost no time in setting the black- smith and carpenter at work, and in
            the mean time sallied forth to see what was remarkable in and about the city. We found
            several Americans in the place, although the number had greatly diminished within a
            year. There are a great many shops, and every' de- scription of goods to be found in
            them. In many of them the clerks speak English, acquired during the occupation of the
            city by the Americans. A large commerce has now grown up between Monterey and the United
            States, which will tend to Americanize the place. At the time of our visit, the singular
            state of the frontier had greatly contributed to increase this commerce.
            Fronunciamentos, another name for revo- lutions, were then in vosrue at Matamoras, Camai

            ; while the real object was to destroy the custom-houses, for the purpose of introducing
            mer- chandise without duty. Large quantities had thus been brought in, and sent into the
            interior of the country. Rode out to the Bishop's palace ; from which, as well as from
            the Loma de Independencia in the rear, one obtains a fine view of the city. This is a
            fine old building of stone, and in its day was no doubt an ele- gant structure ; it was
            in ruins, however, long before General Worth took it. The hill on which it stands is
            about one hundred and twenty -five feet high ; but the portion where the American forces
            made their charge, is some fifty feet higher. On reaching that, they com- manded the
            palace, where the Mexicans had entrench- ed themselves behind a strong battery, but
            which they W -h were soon compelled to evacuate. The city stands on a plain about a mile
            distant, and is embosomed among beautiful gardens and or- chards, its white houses
            presenting a striking contrast with the deep green of the foliage, To the south, runs a
            small stream, a branch of the San Juan River, m the midst of a broad arroyo; beyond
            which a chap- poral plain interspersed with a few cornfields, extends about seven miles
            to the Saddleback Mountain, one of the most singularly shaped eminences in the coun-
            try. This mountain is isolated, and forms the last link of the great chain which so
            abruptly terminates here. To the north and east of the city, a broad plain extends as
            far as the eye can reach, with here and there fields of corn and .sugar cane, among
            wider fields of chappo- 4- 504 SALTILLO ral About half mi I e from the city on this

            was a sharp contest, remains just as it was left by our troops. An American gen- tleman
            familiar with the history of the affair, accompff- nied me in a visit to this quarter,
            and pointed out the several localities. Monterey is the capital of the State of Nueva
            Leon and has a population of from fifteen to eighteen thou- sand souls. f It is the only
            city I visited in Mexico (Hermosillo in Sonora, alone, excepted) which is in- creasing.
            Here improvements were in progress. Many fine houses were in the course of erection ;
            others were undergoing repairs, and every thing had the appear- ance of a thriving,
            active place. The streets are paved and kept clean. Much as has been said of the filth
            of Mexican towns, I can testify that our New York street inspectors might profit by the
            example of Monterey. • la my various journeys through Mexico, this Tvasthe only instance
            of the kind that I met with. f My estimates of the population of this and other towns,

            estimate the population of their towns, and are reluctant to confess their decline. ur

            Mexican troops were driven before they , capitulated.. The city has an elevation of 1626
            feet alcove the level of the sea. We had therefore descended, since leaving Encantada,
            in a distance of seventy -six miles, 4478 feet.* With this sudden descent, we noticed a
            striking change in the temperature. As long as we were on*the high tableland, the
            mornings and evenings were invariably cool, so as to render an overcoat neces- sary. We
            were all glad to get around fires, whenever there was fuel enough to make one; and at
            night, three or four blankets were necessary. Now, on the contra- ry, we experienced the
            genial warmth of June, with roses in bloom in the open air ; thin clothing felt com-
            fortable, and the nights were mild. December 15tJi. Resuming our journey this morn- ing,
            we passed near the citadel, where our escort of ten dragoons, kindly sent by the
            Governor, joined us. Our route was now across a broad plain unob- structed by hill or
            mountain. Passed several ranchos, where the people were engaged in boiling sugar. This
            region produces fine cane, though its cultivation is not so extensive as would be
            supposed. Passed, also, the small towns ot San Domingo and San Francisco ; and three

            ravine to pass with abrupt banks, is bad enough ; but to-day tlie whole country seemed
            to be cut up with them, requiring the utmost care to prevent accidents. After thirty
            miles of continuous chapporal and a bad road, we reached the town of Mier, on the Rio
            Grande at 8 o'clock, though it was midnight before we could get corn for our animals,
            and reduce our camp to quiet- ness. Mier is an old town on the banks of the Alcantra, a
            small stream which empties into the Rio Grande three or four miles beyond, and appears,
            like most other Mexican towns, to be on the decline. In 1828 its population was two
            thousand eight hundred and twen- ty-one. It is now much less. Many of its houses are of
            stone, and well built. It has no lands capable of irrigation; the people, consequently,
            depend upon other occupations than support ; and this, doubtless, is the reason of their

            for its fine manu- factures of scrapes and blankets ; and there was scarce- ly a house
            in which we did not see the women occu- pied in weaving them. These serapes, which are
            worn by all classes, are made of wool, ornamented with a variety of figures and of
            various colors. They bring from six to one hundred dollars each, according to their
            equality and ornaments. This town fills an important place in the annals of the Texan
            revolution, on account of its capture by the Texans, under the command of Colonel
            Fisher, their surrender afterwards to the Mexicans, and their subse- quent history.
            Proceeding up the Rio Grande above Mier, the character of the country changes for the
            better, the bottoms becoming more fertile. The shores are for the greater part, a narrow
            strip of sand or gravel, sur- mounted by river bluffs of various heights. The willow,

            mezquit, ebony, etc., abound. * * Tliis party, which consisted of 261 men, crossed the
            Eio Grande, where they encountered a Mexican force of 2340 men, with whomtbey had a
            severe battle, and took possession of Mier. In this contest, accord- ing to the
            statement of General Green, an officer at the time, the Texan loss was, ten killed and
            twenty-three wounded — that of the Mexicans, between seven and eight hundred killed and
            woanded. The Texans were afterwards induced to surrender to General Mejia, on certain
            pledges being given them by General Ampudia. They were placed under a guard of three
            hundred men, and marched off to the City of Mexico. After they had passed Saltillo and
            were crossing the desert to San Luis Potosi, they rose on their Mexican guard at a place
            called Sa- lado, overpowered them, and made their escape. Had they kept toge- ther and

            509 In October, 1846, a successful attempt was made to asceud the Rio Grande in the
            United States steamer Ma- jor Brown, by order of General Patterson, with a view- to
            ascertain whether or not it were possible to open a communication between Camargo and
            the Presidio del Norte. This vessel drew but two feet of water. She experienced few
            obstacles In reaching the river Salado, nearly a hundred miles by water above Mier.
            Above this, there was a series of continued shoals, rocks, and rapids, among which the ■
            boat repeatedly grounded. She at length reached Laredo, a town about six hun- dred miles
            by water from the mouth of the river. Up to this point it was believed that, with the
            expendi- ture of one hundred thousand dollars, in removing ob- 4 structions, the river
            might be made navigable for boats drawing four feet of water.* December 20th. The bad
            road of yesterday gave us considerable patching up to do, and caused several hours
            detention. The good people of the town availed themselves of this delay, and soon
            thronged the camp, would doubtless Lave gained tlie Texan frontier. They, towever, scat-
            tered and souglit the mountains, where they suffered extremely for the want of water and
            food. The whole population was roused ia pursuit of them ; the small parties were picked
            up, and the main body reduced hy starvation, finally surrendered. They were again

            of 176 prisoners, 17 were shot, the remainder were sent to the city of Mexico. Of these,
            35 died from suffering and starvation. Seven were released through the intercession of

            Many gentlemen of the party had been desirous to take home with them one of these
            articles ; and the opportunity now presented of buy- ing them fresh from the loom, and
            at prices much lower than we had seen tLem in the shops of Monterey and Saltillo,
            induced many to secure specimens. In walking round the camp, my attention was at-
            tracted to some large oyster shells, which protruded above the clay bank ; and, on
            extending my examina- tion about seventy yards to the south, to a deep arroyo, I noticed
            thick beds of shells of the genus Osfrea, m its sides and on its bottom. According to
            Dr. Til- den, these beds extend up to near Loredo ; and Dr. Wislizenus found them two
            miles below Mier on the immediate banks of the river. ■-"■? Our camp was near £A the
            town, and the surface of the clay bank where we found them, was at least fifty feet
            above the river. We now set out for Camargo twenty-five miles dis- tant, keeping the
            western bank of the river, through a forest of chapporal. About several miles distant on
            the opposite bank, we saw the town of Roma, and soon after were cheered with the sight
            of a small steamboat, which occasionally works its way as far as this. It is evident
            that the navigation is attended with difficulties, as we saw her laore than once fast on
            sandbars, which here begin to obstruct the navigation. Finding that the train would not
            reach Camargo before dark, and being anxious to get to Ringgold Barracks as soon as
            possible, I set off in advance, ac- TO RINGGOLD BARRACKS. • 511 companied by Mr.
            Eadziminski and our guide. On J- i reaching the river San Juan, a large stream which en-
            ters the Rio Grande, three miles from Camargo, and on which that town stands, we found a
            body of three or four hundred Mexican troops, cavalry and infantry, waiting to cross.
            This stream is quite deep, and is crossed by a ferry boat attached to a rope extend- ing
            from one bank to the other. As the boat would V hold but a few horses, it was evident
            that, if I waited /or the whole to cross, I should not get over for hours. I sent my
            guide (who it appeared was a soldier belong- ing to the command at Camargo), with my
            compli- ments to the commanding officer, Colonel Cruz, to per- mit me to cross at once.
            This gentleman very polite- acceded to my request, and directed the boat to take over me
            and my party immediately. On reach- ing the opposite side, I rode to the quarters of
            Colonel Cruz, to pay my respects to him, and request permis- sion of him to allow the
            train of the Boundary Com- mission to pass unmolested. He assured me that every facility
            should be afforded the train to cross the San Juan, and tlience to the American line.
            There was some danger here ; for this officer was in arms against the ■ Mexican
            government ; and but for the character of my party, it would not have been suffered to
            pass so quietly. We had had, too, a narrow escape from the rebel chief Caravajal, who,
            with a band of some two hundred des- perate characters, had been devastating the
            frontier. We had heard of them at various places after leaving Monterey ; and at one
            village, we learnt that they had passed but the day before. The population of Camargo is
            about the same as H Flk I 512 SALTILLO TO RINGGOLD BARRACKS, I tt that of Mier. Its
            houses are built of stone or adobe. There is more arable land here, and the same
            mannfac- F- tures are carried on as at Mier. Before the Indian wars and the wars of
            Texas, there were numerous ranchos on both sides of the Rio Grande. Their occupants were
            chiefly employed in raising of cattle, of which at one time, they possessed not less
            than forty thousand head. These establishments have now been destroyed, or abandoned.
            During the late war, the American army had a large depot at this place. The steamboat
            which navigate the Rio Grande, finds no difficulty in comin up as far as Camargo. At
            high water, boats drawin five feet, ascend it with safety. A ride of three miles, after

            United States Surveyor, had been awaiting my arrival. Decemher 2\st Our train reached

            space still to be covered between the great Chizo Caiioji and the Rio San Pedro, on

            despatch itself : Department of the Intebiob, Washington, Oct 15, 1852. Sir :— In the
            Deficiency Bill of the last session, which was approved '21st July, Congress
            appropriated for the Mexican Boundary Survey the TO CORPUS CHRISTI. 515 The course I had
            to pursue was plain. Congress tiad said that if the southern boundary of New Mexico had
            been estabhshed further north" of the town of El Paso than it is laid down in
            Disturnell's map, the money appropriated to carry on the survey could not b of th ed
            either by words of the treaty itself The boundary line was sum of eighty thousand
            dollars. This was immediately absorbed by the drafts and liabilities which were then
            outstanding, and the additional sum of twenty-five thousand dollars for like denands was
            obtained by the act approved 31st August, which has also been nearly exhausted, and
            other debts still remain unpaid. In this latter the sum of one hun- dred and twenty
            thousand dollars was appropriated for the present fiscal year, with a proviso that it
            should not be used *' until it shall be made satisfactorily to appear to the President
            of the United States that the southern boundary of New Mexico is not established by the
            Commis- sioner and Surveyor of the United States further north of the town called ' Paso
            ' than the same is laid down in Disturnell's map, which is added to the ti-eaty "
            Inclosed I send you a printed copy of ray report to the President in regard to this
            proviso, and of his indorsement thereon. You will perceive that the President and myself
            have been forced to the conclusion that, in view of this restriction, the money can- not
            legally be drawn from the treasury. It will not be proper, therefore, for you to make
            any further drafts upon the department. * No exception has been, or could possibly be,
            taken to the river portion of the boundary; and it is much to be regretted that the
            department has not authority to use the appropriation for that portion of the survey.
            You may, possibly, already have the means of maintaining your respective parties long
            enough to complete the survey of the river, or until you shall have been advised of
            further action by Congress on the subject. The withdrawal of the Commission is not
            imperatively called for by the action of Congress, except in so far as the withholding
            of funds may render it necessary. It would be very desirable to avoid it, if possible ;
            as Congress will again be in session in the course of about six weeks, and possibly as
            soon as you will receive this communication. * * 516 RINGGOLD BARRACKS establislied at
            32° 22' north latitude, where it stands on the treaty map. El Paso is placed on that map
            about seven minutes of latitude south of the boundary ; but when this town is removed to
            its true position at 31 45', the distance between the town and the boun- dary is of
            course increased to the extent of the error of the map. I had not money sufficient to
            continue the work, or Such a Tnovement would also be attended with much delay in the
            com- pletion of the survey, and greatly increased expenses to the United States and to
            the government of Mexico, besides embarrassment and hardship to the employes of the
            Commissionj whose sole dependence is upon their individual labors. It would likewise be
            a cause of further dissatisfaction on the part of the Mexican government. It will not be
            proper for you in any event to continue operations on the disputed por- tion of the
            boundary (the southern and western limits of New Mexico), nor to mate any further drafts
            upon the department ; and if you have not the means already acquired in the manner
            indicated for completing the survey of the Rio Grande, you will of course cease
            operations altogether, and return to the United States with your surveying parties. But
            not knowing precisely your situation in these respects, your return or con- tinuation in
            the field must, with these views of the department before you, be left to your own sound
            discretion. ***** In the event of your being obliged to return from the field, you will

            defray the expenses of the officers and men to their homes. The money was tendered to me
            on my drafts by several houses to the amount of seventy -five thousand dollars, if I
            decided to o on with the sur- vey ; but point Honorable Se clear, and however desirous I
            was to complete the work, the will of my government must be obeyed, no matter at how
            great a sacrifice. The cretary directed me iff already/ had the means, to con- tinue
            operations on the Rio Grande, if not, to cease altoerether and return home. The
            intention of Con- to break up the survey, and my a duty was to submit. The next step was
            to disband the Commission as soon as possible, to get the officers and men to their
            homes, and to place the valuable property of the go- vernment where it could be taken
            care of at the least expense, and where it would be convenient, should Congress, on
            further reflection, remove the proviso and order the survey to be resumed. To reach
            Washington or New York from this dis- tant place would cost a considerable sum ; and I
            found my means quite insufficient to defray the expenses of more than one half of those
            whom the government was bound to transport back to the places from which they came.
            Plere was a sad dilemma for a large body of men to be placed in by an act of Congress,
            without usly their par ardu two years and a half, risking life and health in the
            faithful performance of their duties. I would have been justified in selling off at
            once, at public auction, t 518 EIXGGOLD BARRACKS r all the government property, and
            appropriating the proceeds to the pay of the men, and to enabling the ofletcers to reach
            their homes. Such a course would have been adopted by most officers placed in my posi-
            tion ; but I was willing to submit to inconveniences if the laboring men could be
            relieved. I determined, therefore, to divide the money in my possession among the
            officers, as far as it would go, to meet the expense of reaching their homes. It was o h
            for about one half I then directed the qua r ter-master and commissary, Mr. George
            Thurber, tc take the entire train of animals and wagons (includin those used by Major
            Emory and his parties), together with all the public property, except the instruments,
            and proceed with the same to San Antonio. That place was a convenient point from which
            the survey could again be resumed whenever it would be the pleasure of Congress to order
            it ; and it was a place where the animals could be kept at the least expense. I also
            desired Mr. Thurber to reserve twelve of the best wagons, one hundred mules, and a
            portion of the equipments and camp equipage, and to sell the re- mainder at public
            auction, and apply the proceeds to the payment of the men. And I further directed him to
            make arran.srements with some mercantile house in San Antonio to advance the sum
            necessary to pay off the laboring men and teamsters, as well as to enable the remaining
            officers to return to their homes, and to draw on me at Washington for the same.* The

            intending to follow the next day with the rest of the train. The country for five or six
            miles is midulating, with low hills and a gentle ascent from the river until the plain
            is reached. For this dis- tance it is covered with the same dense chapporal as on the
            opposite side of the river, and is equally desti- tute of grass. Passing this belt, a
            higher level is reached, Avhere there is better soil Here grass be- gins to appear,,

            grassy, in- terspersed with the prickly pear and low mezquit, opening occasionally for a
            few miles without shrubbery. The road became quite sandy and heavy for the ani- mals. In
            the afternoon, stopped at Sal Colorado, a miserable cattle rancho with a well, where we
            stopped to water our animals. This place is called forty miles from Ringgold, which is a
            large estimate. There are pens and corrals here, used for catching and securing
            mustangs, in which this portion of Texas abounds. Continued our journey to Santa Teresa
            five miles fur- ther, where we encamped. Here was a deserted ran- cho in ruins, with
            three wells near. It had been used, like that at Sal Colorado, for ensnaring wild
            horses. Last year the Comauches attacked it, murdered the occupants, burned the houses,
            and took away all the cattle, mules, and horses. It has not since been occu- pied. In
            two of the wells, which were about fifteen feet deep, the water was brackish ; but from
            the third we procured good water with some difficulty. Becemher 2Wi. The mustangs came
            around our camp in great numbers last night. They so alarmed the mules that, fearing a

            Herds of mustangs, going at full sjoeed, crossed and recrossed the broad prairie,
            presenting a beautiful spectacle as they stretched for a mile or more, with their long
            buslij tails streaming in the wind. They did not venture within a quarter of a mile of
            us. Beer and antelope were also seen in great numbers bounding over the broad plain or
            feeding in herds. They too were shy, and had evidently come in contact with man before.
            As there was neither tree nor bush to be seen, and no cover of any sort, all our efforts
            to get within rifle-shot were unavailing. Kear Loma Blanca is the bed of a laguna, which

            sought for some in vain. Deeply worn paths made by the mustangs were seen in every
            direction, showing that it was a place of re- sort for these animals. After travelling
            eight hours we reached a chain of lagunas called Los Olmos, which crossed our path.

            of a road. To-day continued the same ; *yet the man who pretended to guide us seemed
            familiarly acquainted with it. A few hours after leaving, the prairie near the horizon
            seemed to be moving, with long undu- lations, like the waves of the ocean. Unable to
            account for this singular appearance, I looked with .my tele- scope,' when, to my
            surprise, I discovered the whole prairie towards the horizon alive with mustangs. Soon
            after they could be seen coming towards the train. Major Emory at this time was in
            advance of me about half a mile with his portion of the wagons. We saw the long line of
            mustangs approach him, and soon after pass before, the whole herd folio win o after, and

            sprang from the train and dashed off at full speed after and among the wild horses. The

            direction. a htened herd made directly same long line, the termination of which we could
            not see, as it lost itself far in the distance. I now became alarmed, fearing a general
            stampede among our mules; for nothing can restrain these timid crea- tures when
            frightened. If they cannot take their wagon with them, they become so frantic that thej
            will tear themselves from their harness and flee away. Our first precaution was to close
            up the wagons, so that only those in the first one would see the mustangs. The mules of
            the second were placed alongside of the foremost wagon, the next by the side of the
            second, and so on to the last, each wagon thus protecting the team that followed it. We
            now locked the wheels of all, and men stood by the leaders to restrain and quiet them.
            As I had no inclination to be carried off against J .1 524 RINGGOLD BARRACKS my will
            among a herd of frantic wild horses after the fashion of Mazeppa, I dismounted and
            hitched my mule to a wagon, and with several others ran with my , fire-arms to meet the
            advancing steeds, which were now nearly upon us, led off by a fearless stallion. We
            discharged our arms at them as they approached, and fortunately with good effect. The
            leader was turned, and the avalanche of wild animals swept by us like a tornado, much to
            our relief We held in for a few minutes until the herd had passed, when we unlocked our
            wheels and hastened forward to the first of the train, which had halted. By the time we

            captured and brought back, except one, and that one of the most valuable horses
            belonging to the party. This animal was ridden by the wagon-master, and when in full
            pursuit of the runaways, he stej)ped : one of the burrowing places which abound on
            prairies, fell, and threw his rider over his head. Th the freed from restraint, he
            ioined his wild breth and disappeared on the prairie, with his saddle, bridle, and

            plain, and attributed the flight of animals towards us, which we had seen during the
            day, to this fire. It stretched for miles in both directions, and was sweeping directly
            towards us. Whenever it reached a patch of high grass, volumes of dense smoke rose up,
            while the vivid flames leaped with greater rapidity over the plain. We rode up and down
            for some distance, but could find no open- ing through. At length a place was seen where
            the fire raged with less fury. Here the horsemen led the way ; whereupon the teamsters

            miles, I hurried forward. Five miles further, over an excellent road, brought us to San

            to-day, and, ex- cept where burned, was covered with excellent grass. The bed and banks

            party was in motion at the break o day. The prairie was now a dead level, the grass
            short, and the road very good. Not a bush or a tree was to be seen ; yet there PL ■,3

            appeared. The deer and antelope were usually grazing in herds of from ten to fifty ; and
            as we approached they leisurely trotted off to a short dis- tance, and again stopped. We
            shot none ; for as I was desirous to reach Corpus Christi before night, we were pushing
            forward on the run, and could not be delayed for the sake of game, tempting as it was.
            Among the antelope I noticed several of a pure white. Ten miles brought us to Agua Dulce

            twelve miles further to the Oso, a small pond, or rather mud-hole, the water in which
            was so bad that the animals would not drink it. The road being good and the weather

            any place I had yet seen on the Gulf of Mexico, having the advantage of a bluff from
            eighty to one hundred feet high above the shores of the Gulf The business portion of the
            town stands chiefly on the beach below ; but the bluff is now beini? covered with
            dwelling houses, and is by far the most pleasant situa- tion. Like other places on the
            northern shores of the Gulf, it is separated from the sea by a broad bay. Here there is
            plenty of water ; but on the bar which connects it with the Gulf there is only about six
            feet. Corpus Christi Bay is about forty miles from north to south, and twenty from east
            to west. Connected with TO -VASHINGTOX. 529 it, and makiDg far up into the land, is
            Nueces Baj, about ten miles long and five wide, which receives at its head the Nueces
            River. This river has its rise in the Guadalupe Mountains about three hundred miles
            distant. The stream, which is deep, narrow, and rapid, with very steep banks, is
            navigable for small boats, about forty miles from its mouth ; and with some im-
            provement the navigation might be extended to the point of confluence with the Rio Frio,
            its principal tributary. The latter has a course of about one hun- dred and fifty miles,
            and has for its tributaries the San Miguel, Atascoco, La Parida, and Tordillo rivers.
            The San Miguel is about one hundred and twenty miles in length, and runs nearly parallel
            with the Rio Frio. The 1| Laguna, the Leona, the Arroyo Saco, and the Arroyo • de
            Uvalde, are also branches of this stream— the last named " being formed of nearly a
            hundred springs of crystal water, that gush from the munificent soil of the valley,
            which is headed by a singularly difficult defile, named the Canon de Uvalde." West of
            Corpus Christi Bay, several small streams enter the Laguna del Madre, L- 4 , 4- \ V v..

            Olmos, and Escondida. Most of these we passed in crossing from the Rio Grande ; but the
            water in them was so low that we hardly recog- nised them as running streams, and some
            were entirely dry. The land near Corpus Christi is very fertile. Groups and belts of
            timber are found near the coast ; but after leaving this, a vast undulating prairie
            extends from the Nueces to within three or four miles of the Rio Grande. This plain is
            covered with the richest grass, and abounds VOL. II. — 34 530 CORPUS CHEISTI in
            mustangs, deer, antelope, and large herds of beef- ■ cattle. Opposite Corpus Christi
            Bay, separating it from tlie Gulf, is Mustang Island, about tliirty-five miles long and
            from two to four in width. Further south, another long and narrow sound opens, called
            the La- guna del Madre, about ninety miles in length and from three to six in width ; an
            island about the same length, and from two to four miles in width, separates it from the
            Gulf. This laguna is so shallow as to be unavail- able for navigation, even for vessels
            of light draft. The position of Corpus Christi renders it very healthy ; and when many
            other places on the coast suf- fer from fevers, this, owing to its elevation, is exempt.
            It is at present the Head Quarters of the Military Di- vision in Texas ; and from the
            facility of entering the harbor, it is destined to be one of the most important places

            and forty miles distant. We had not proceeded more than ten or twelve miles, be- fore
            the wind died away and left us becalmed. Creep- ing beneath the deck that covered the
            forward part of the boat, we stretched ourselves on our blankets in a space about three
            feet wide, where we contrived to get a little sleep. January 5t7i. The morning found us
            on the oppo- site side of Corpus Christi Bay, a light breeze wafting ns eastward towards
            Aransas Pass. The navigation here is carried on with boats of light burden through the
            shallow bays or lagunas, which line the west and north-west shores of the Gulf of
            Mexico. These bays are exceedingly shallow, sometimes presenting a breadth of ten or
            fifteen miles, by a hundred or more in length. Yet these broad spaces of water are often

            Our course lay through a channel less than twenty ds % d on both sides but an inch or
            two above the water. These were covered with myriads of water-fowl, including cranes,
            swans, herons, ibises, geese, ducks, curlews, j)lover, sand-pipers, etc. The large
            cranes and swans stood in lines extending for miles, appearing like a light sandy beach
            or white cliff; and it was impossible to dispel the delusion, until the vast flock, with
            a simul- taneous scream that could be heard for miles, rose from their resting j)lace.
            Occasionally, we would round a point which concealed a bay the surface of which was
            filled with ducks and geese; these, taking the alarm, would rise in one continuous
            flock, making a noise like thunder, as they flapped their wings on emerging from the

            CORPUS CHRISTI Joseph's Island. This island is less than two miles wide, and about
            twenty -five in length. South-west of this, between Aransas Pass and Corpus Christi
            Inlet, is Mustang Island, already spoken of. Aransas Bay extends about twenty -five
            miles from north-east to south-west, and is about twelve miles wide. It has a general
            depth of from eight to twelve feet, but is obstructed by a shoal and range of islands
            extending across it, over which there is less than three feet of water. Connected with
            Aransas is Co- pano Bay, twenty miles in length by three in width. The shores of these
            bays are extremely low and flat. We made but little progress to-day, the wind hav- ing
            died away ; and finding ourselves fast on a bar, there was no occasion to anchor. So we
            again turned in, and lay by till morning. January 6tJi. One of the sailors carried me on
            shore on his back, that I might have a shot or two at the shoals of ducks near by ; but
            as there was no shel- ter behind which they could be approached, the few that I shot
            hardly repaid the trouble. We lay here several hours, when at length a light breeze
            sprung up from the west which wafted us onward, and across Espiritu Santo Bay, about
            twenty miles in length and ten in width. At its head, it receives the waters of two
            considerable rivers, the San Antonio and Guada- lupe. It is separated from the Gulf by
            Matagorda Island, about thirty miles in length. , An amusing incident occurred when we

            could not expect to reach our place of des- tination before the next day. Our water was
            gone; and there was none to be found on the beach. Seeing a small craft approaching from
            an opposite dhection, we stood for her ; and when within two hundred yards, r , our
            captain hailed her, and ashedif they could us any water. The reply was in the affirmativ

            bay was less than three feet deep, although we were many miles from the shore, which was
            barely visible. Did one not know where he was, he might imagine himself at sea. At the
            eastern end of the bay, the water was so shallow that the' passengers were carried on
            the backs of the men to a small island near by, while the captain and sailors Jumped
            into the water, and lifted and push- ed the boat over. A little further we came to a
            "dug out"— that is, a passage cut or dug across a bar, about twenty yards through. Here
            the men got into the water again; and each of the passengers taking an oar, we managed
            to force the boat through. The shal- lowness of the water and the consequent
            difficulties of * navigating these lagoons after a norther, may be judg- ed of, when I
            state that our little craft drew less than fifteen inches. January 7th. After a third
            night passed in the open boat, we emerged from these shallow waters soon ► after
            day-light; and crossing Paso Cavallo, with the town of that name on our right, we landed
            at 8 o'clock * 536 CORPUS CHRISTl at Decrow's Point We breakfasted at a hotel, where we
            learned that the steamer Louisiana, from Indianola for New Orleans, would pass here
            to-morrow. Decrow's Point forms the western termination .of Matao'orda Peninsula, a neck
            of land about sixty miles in length, and from one to two in width. Within this is
            Matagorda Bay, another shallow body of water, from six to ten miles wide. Paso Cavallo
            (Horse Pass) is the entrance to this bay from the Gulf of Mexico, and is always
            considered safe for vessels drawing fi'om eight to nine feet of water. The principal and
            most accessi- ble port within Matagorda Bay is Indianola, where steamers drawing eight
            feet of water enter. Many rivers empty into the bay ; the largest of which, the 'r/1
            Colorado, rises in the Guadalupe Mountains, and has a course of about eight hundred
            miles before it reaches the Gulf. Among the other streams, are the La Vaca and Navidad
            rivers. Within this bay is La Vaca, which is reached by small vessels. A railway is now
            in the course of construction from Saluria to San Antonio, which will render this the
            most important port on the Gulf, it beinsr acccs? safe harb An ble for large vessels,
            and aiFord on between Indianola and New Orleans, with steamers of a large class; besides
            which, vessels run direct to New York and Boston. The number of passengers and the
            quantity of merchandise coming hither, are evidences of the thriving condition of this
            portion of the State. January 8th. The steamer Louisiana came to, this morning, off the
            Point, when I took passage in her for New Orleans. Major Emory, Dr. Webb, Mr. Radzi- '

            Galveston this morning, where we remained until 4 o'clock, p. 3i. This city had greatly
            increased since August, 1850, when we stopped here. Its commerce, too, judging from the
            number of ships and steamers, must have augment- ed in proportion. January lOth. Late in
            the afternoon we reached New Orleans, where I took up my quarters at the St. Louis
            Hotel, .- January lltJi. On my journey from Texas, I learned by a newspaper that the
            United States Senate had, on the assembling of Congress, removed the restriction which
            prevented the use of the appropriation under certain conditions ; so that the survey
            might now be permitted to go on again. But the commission had been broken up ; the
            injury had already been inflicted upon its mem- bers, who were now scattered and on
            their way to their h field of operations. I, therefore, sent a telegraphic despatch to
            the Hon. Alex. H. H. Stuart, Secretary of the Inte- rior, advising him of my arrival at
            New Orleans, with portion of the officers of the Commission posal, as Yell as
            instructions as to further proceedings. Jaymarij 14th. After waiting four days for an
            answer to my despatch, the necessity of my being in Washington as soon as possible
            required that I should delay no longer; particularly as I now learned that t 4 538
            CORPUS CHRISTI TO WASHINGTON the telegraph wires were broken, and commumca o
            consequently interrupted. I therefore took pas- i on the steamer Chancellor, to sail
            this evening for Louisville, accompanied by Dr. Webb and Messrs. Ja- cobs and Force.
            Major Emory and the other officers of the Commission were to take the land route ; but
            having caught a cold in my boat voyage along the Texan coast, from which I was suffering
            severely I deemed it most prudent to take a more easy though longer route by the
            Mississippi River. Our boat was deep and consequently slow, so that days before we

            survey was continued to the Initial Point of the southern boundary of New Mexico on the
            Rio Grande, making altogether a distance of between nine hundred and a thousand miles
            surveyed. At nearlv all the astronomical stations on this line, upwards of fifty in
            number, observations were made by a Fox dip circle for magnetic inclination, declina-
            tion, and intensity. An accurate meteorolofical reorister was kept through the whole
            line of march. An. interesting com- parison of the aneroid and ordinary barometer was
            made, extending over elevations varying from the level of the sea to an altitude of six
            thousand feet. A com- plete set of barometrical and aneroid observations were taken for

            Antonio to San Eleazario, on the Rio Grande, exhibiting not only the most prominent
            points, but likewise the ele- vations and depressions in each day's march. The
            astronomical and magnetic observations were made by Lieutenant A. W. Whipple, of the
            corps of topographical engineers, acting chief astronomer in charge of the party, and
            under whose direction the whole work was carried on. r The survey was performed by John

            observatory atFronteras, where a most interesting: and elaborate series of astronomical,
            magnetic, and meteorological observations were made, the latter by Mr. Chandler, who

            by Lieu- tenant Whipple, and the meteorological observations continued by Mr. Henry C.

            of stetches. 542 RESULTS OF THE LABORS y. H r Gratam, a party under the charge of John
            Bull, Esq. first assistant surveyor, made a reconnaisance of the coun- try between the
            Rio Grande and the Gila, in which a more direct road was opened from Doiia Ana to the
            Copper Mines. This reconnaisance was extended to the Presidio of Janos, in the State of
            Chihuahua. 5. The southern boundary of New Mexico, ex- tending west three degrees from
            the Initial Point on the Rio Grande at 32° 22" north latitude, and from the western
            termination of the line due north to the Gila, was surveyed exclusively by Lieutenant A.
            W. Whipple and his assistants. This officer also surveyed the river Gila, from the point
            where it is intersected by the before-mentioned line to its junction with the Colorado,
            a distance, including the sinuosities of the river, of about four hundred and fifty
            miles, making together between six and seven hundred miles from the Rio Grande to the
            Colorado. The boundary along this parallel was the most difficult part of the whole
            survey. Astronomical observations were made during the survey of the Gila every night
            but two, which were cloudy. The whole number of astronomical and me- teorological
            stations was about sixty ; nearly all of which were also magnetic stations. To these it
            is proper to add that there were three astronomical and magnetic stations, besides
            several made by Lieutenant Whipple on his trip from San Diego to the Colorado, in
            September, 1849, thus completing a consecutive chain of points of observation by this
            officer extending from the Atlantic coast, via San Antonio, El Paso del Norte, and the
            mouth of the Gila, to the Pacific Ocean. OP THE BOUNDARY COMMISSION. 543 At most of
            these stations the three elements of inclina- tion, declination, and intensity were
            observed. 6. A chain and compass survey was made hy A. B. Gray, Esq., Principal
            Surveyor, his first assistants being John Bull and J. H. Prioleau, Esqs., from the point
            where the southern boundary of New Mexico strikes the river Gila to a point about
            seventy miles above its junction with the Colorado, about four hun- w dred miles. This
            survey was independent of that made by Lieut. Whipple. 7. In returning from San Diego,
            California, the unfinished portion of the survey of the Gila was com- pleted by Lieut.
            Whipple ; after which our parties again united at the Pimo Villages, on the Gila. We
            then returned together to El Paso by a different route from that taken on our journey
            out, thereby enabling us to collect much valuable information in the north- ern portions
            of Sonora and Chihuahua not previously explored by a scientific pai'ty. On this journey
            or reconnoissance (to use a military term), of which a detailed account is given in this
            work, an elaborate ■ series of astronomical and meteorological observations J were made
            by Lieut. Whipple in the same manner as those before mentioned. The true position in
            lati- tude and longitude of Tucson, Tubac, Santa Cruz, Gua- dalupe Pass, Janos, and
            Corrolitos, besides intermediate points, was then first determined by this officer ; and
            the mountains, streams, and other geographical features * I regret that I am unable to
            speak more fully of this survey, as Mr. Gray has never furnished me the details or made
            any official report to me. 544 KESULTS OF THE LABORS of this hitherto unknown region,
            were accurately deli- neated upon the maps. The barometrical profiles constructed by
            Lieut. Whipple, and the minute topography of the maps laid down in the two extensive
            journeys in which this officer accompanied jn.e between the Rio Grande and the Pacific,
            are of the highest importance as showing the practicability of a route for a railroad or
            other public highway south of the Gila. In order to render this information immediately
            available, a reduction of the astronomical and meteorological observations has already
            been made, as well as barometrical profiles of these several reconnoissances. The
            surveys of Mr. Gray and Lieutenant Whipple, and the astronomical observations made by
            the latter in the journeys to and from California, have enabled the Commission to lay
            down with accuracy for the first time the geography of the Gila and of the vast region
            between the Rio Grande and the shores of the Pacific. The plot and topographical
            sketches of the survey between the Rio Grande and the Colorado were mostly completed in
            California and transmitted to Washing- ton. At the same time reports of various
            reconnois- sances made along the line, with tables of astronomical, magnetic, and
            meteorological observations by Lieut. Whipple were forwarded. These plottings, reports,
            and tables were placed by me in the hands of Major Emory, Principal Surveyor, on my
            return to Washing- ton ; and engineers and draughtsmen have since been engaged in
            completing the maps, and reducing the observations, under his direction. 8. Along this

            some of my leisure moments, particularly in jour- neys on which I was not accompanied by
            Mr. Pratt. Of the labors of the parties on the Rio Grande or Bravo Del Norte, I have now
            to speak. These parties were all placed by me under charge of Brevet Lieut. Col. J. D.
            Graham, of the Topographical Engineers, Principal Astronomer and Head of the
            Topographical Scientific Corps, a programme of which will be found in Appendix F. This
            officer was detailed for ser- vice on the Boundary Survey, on the 23d October, 1850, and
            reached the Head Quarters of the Commis- sion at the Copper Mines, New Mexico, the
            nearest point to our field of operations, on the 2d of August, 1851. He was recalled by
            the Hon. Alex. H. II. Stu- art, Secretary of the Interior, on the 13th of Septem- ber of
            the same year ; and on the same day, Brevet Major W. H. Emory was appointed to his
            place. The latter reached El Paso on the 25th of November, and delivered the order of
            recall to his predecessor. Major Emory, in his letter to me under date of June 1st, 1852

            sur- vey of tbe Rio Grande from Loredo to its mouth, and a portion in the canon of that
            river, was completed be- fore the close of the year. In the department of Zoology, much
            has been accomplished by officers of the Commission. The col- lectors were Mr. J. H.
            Clark, Dr. Thomas H. Webb, and Mr. Arthur Schott. A large collection of fishes was made
            in the waters of the Rio Grande, and in the tributaries of the Gila and the streams to
            the south of it, by Mr. Clark, a large portion of which have proved new to science. Many
            of these have already received a sort of publicity through the proceedings of the
            Academy of Natural Sciences. Among them are some new genera. Repre- sentatives of the
            families Lahridae and Gliaracini were detected in the "waters of the Rio Grande. A
            considerable number of reptiles were collected by Messrs. Clark and Schott, embracing
            new genera and species, which have already been described by Professors S. F. Baird and
            Charles Girard, in the Proceedings of the Academy, and their *' Catalogue of North
            American Serpents," published by the Smithso- nian Institution, In speaking of the
            collection sent home by Mr. Clark in the spring of 1852, these dis- tinguished
            naturalists remark, that " It will be perfect- ly safe to say, that one hundred

            Leconte. In birds, and the smaller mammalia, some interesting specimens were collected
            by each of the gentlemen named- When fully studied and described, these collec- tions,
            it is expected, will furnish new and interesting facts respecting the distribution of
            animal life in the country explored ; and if properly illustrated by figures, they will
            constitute a most valuable contribution to our knowledge of the animals of that portion
            of the United States. Botanical collections were made by Dr. J. M. Bige- low Dr. C. C
            Mr. Charles Wright Mr George Thurber, and Parry, Dr. Bigelow's collections were made
            upon the road between Indianola and El Paso, in the vicinity of the Copper Mines, and
            upon the Kio Grande. He also made an excursion to Lake Guzman and other points in
            pursuit of specimens in his branch of natural science. His collection has not be IS not,
            to my knowledge upon ; but from the zeal and enthusiasn with which that gentleman
            prosecuted his researches there is no doubt that it contains much that is valuable, Mr.
            Wright accompanied Colonel Graham els; and his connection with the Comm d soon after the
            removal of that officer. A portion of Mr. Wright's collection has been published bj Dr.
            Gray among the Memoirs of the Smithsonian Institu and contains many new genera and
            species. Mr. whose name is identified with the botany of Texas W 550 RESULTS OF THE
            LABORS Northern Mexico, is now engaged in the Ringgold Exploring Expedition, and, by his
            devotion to the botany of the regions visited, will doubtless contribute largely to the
            value of the scientific results of that en- terprise. Mr. Thurber, though for the
            greater part of the time acting as quarter- master, made a large collection, the
            examination of which has not yet been completed. Some six or seven unpublished genera
            have been de- termined, and a corresponding number of new species. As he collected in
            localities afterwards passed over by Mr. Wright, and a portion of the time in company
            with that gentleman, many of the novelties in his col- lection have been anticipated in
            the memoir alluded to. As Dr. Parry was engaged with a portion of the Commission under
            Major Emory, I had no opportunity of acquiring a personal knowledge of his labors ; but
            from his reputation as a botanical observer, I have no doubt that he improved
            successfully the opportunities his field presented. The geological collection was made
            by Dr. Thomas H. Webb, Secretary of the Joint Commission. This officer was indefatigable
            in his labors to collect a series of specimens that should illustrate the structure and
            mineral resources of the vast region traversed by the Commission ; but the collection
            made on the journey from the Qopper Mines of New Mexico to California was mostly lost,
            in consequence of the abandonment of the wagons and the perishing of the animals. A few
            boxes of minerals, were, however, collected m California and sent home in safety by
            water. On the journey from the Pacific coast, by the Gila and El rl'" OF THE BOUNDARY

            of fossils and mineralsin the valley of the Rio Grande was also made by Mr. Arthur
            Schott. In ethnology the collection was made almost ex- clusively by myself. This
            consists of vocabularies, each embracing two hundred words, in upwards of twenty Indian
            languages. Many of these had never been taken down before, and few as fully as by me.
            Further to illustrate the aboriginal tribes, I have obtained accurate and characteristic
            portraits of many individuals seen, both male and female, with sketches exhibiting their
            manners and customs, their arts, hus- bandry, etc- I had prepared an extended
            disquisition on the semi-civilized tribes occupying the vast basin between the Rocky
            Mountains, or rather the Rio Grande, and the Colorado of California ; but the subject
            was found to be so extensive and so deeply interesting, that I determined to reserve it
            for a special report, which I intend to prepare on the ethnology of the Indian tribes of
            the extensive region explored by the Boundary Commission, in which also my Indian
            vocabularies will be embraced. By the preceding statement it will be seen that no
            exertions were spared, and no suitable opportunities omitted, to do all in my power to
            advance the cause of science. It now remains for the government to take such measures as
            it may deem proper to lay the results 552 RESULTS OF THE LABORS, ETC of the Commission,

            however barren, or however distant from water, where rabbits and wolves were not seen.
            On these plains, whether desert or grassy, there are fewer birds. Often, for days
            together, nothing of the feathered tribe was seen except the omnipresent crow. Living

            various tinds of deer ; the large wolf Qobo), and the coyote, raccoon, skunk, marmot,

            animals, of course, have their particular localities. The elk is not found south of the
            Gila, The beaver is still met with on the Pecos, the Bio Grrande, the Grila and its
            northern tributaries ; and within a mile of El Paso I saw evidences of his labors. In
            the Copper Mine o Mountains named are extremely abundant. But while the parched and
            desert plains are so destitute of (quadrupeds and birds, they abound in reptiles and
            insects in the greatest variety. Lizards of every size and color, from one and a half to
            eighteen inches in length, are found here ; all of which are harmless. horned A which
            are allied to the chameleon and lizard. Of these harm- less little creatures, all
            covered, as a means of defence, with sharp horny projections, there is also a great
            variety. Next to tliese, come the poisonous reptiles. First is the horrid taran- tultty
            with his hairy body as large as a pigeon's egg, and with legs as long as one's finger,
            striding over the ground and nest- ling under one's blankets at nisrht. His sting, or

            Then there is the venajroti, as the Mexicans call it, a black insect ahout two inches in
            length, also very poisonous ; and lastly, the alacran, a species of scorpion, the most
            venomous of all. These last, fortunately, are chiefly confined to the city of Durango ;
            where, owing to their numhers, and the fatality which attends their sting, a bounty of
            six cents is given by the government for every one killed. We close this catalogue With
            the rattlesnaJie, which needs no description. This creature is found every where, from
            the Gulf of Mexico to the Pacific, alike in grassy, rocky, and desert regions. Hundreds
            of them were killed by out party ; yet I am not aware that any of us were bitten. Two
            horses that were bitten died. All the other reptiles and insects of which I have spoken
            are found throughout the countries contiguous to the Boundary, and were seen almost
            daily. Thus has nature adapted a numerous class of animals for the otherwise solitary
            desert, where they enjoy Undisputed sway. . These plains also abound in moles, rats,
            ttiice, rabbits, and other burrowing animals ; sometimes to such au extent, that it is
            dangerous to pass over them with horses {nd mules. Many specimens of the lesser mammalia
            were brought home by the Commission, as well as a collection of reptiles and insects. Of
            reptiles, a very large number was discovered which are entirely new. This collection is
            now in the cabinet of the Smithsonian Institution at Washington. One of the most
            interesting animals met with on the prai- ries and high table-lands, is the " prairie
            dog," which is in fact no other than a marmot, having no character in common ith dogs.
            Its look and habits are totally diiFerent. The Canadian trappers used to call it a "
            petit cliien ; " and this, to- gether with the noise it makes, which however, is more of
            a chirp or yelp than a bark, has caused it to receive the name f ' prairie dog.' The
            first community of these little creatures we met with as in Texas, near Brady's Creek, a
            branch of the Colorado 558 NATURAL HISTORY. of the east. This was the largest we ever
            saw nor have I ever heard of one as extensive. For three days we travelled through this
            colony during which time we did not lose sight of them. On cither side as far as we
            could see over the plain, their habitations extended, standing out in bold relief in the
            little hillocks they had raised with the earth brought from their subterranean abodes.
            Their habitations are usually about ten yards apart and the hillocks contain from one to
            two cartloads of earth each. Some have one entrance others two, which incline at an
            angle of about forty-five degrees. To what depth they extend I could never learn, and
            only know that the frequent attempts to drown the animals out by pouring large
            quantities of water in them, have rarely suc- ceeded.* A well-beaten track extends from
            one to the other of these hillocks, showing that a close Intimacy exists between their
            occupants, or perhaps family connection. We supposed this community or "dog-town,' as it
            is called, extended at least sixty miles, as we travelled at that time twenty miles a
            day. As to its width, we could not form a decided opinion ; but presuming it to have
            been only half as wide as it was long an idea may be formed of the vast number of
            animals it con- tains.f For the greater part of this distance the country was flat, and
            covered with short grass, kept so probably by these ani- * Lieutenant Abert mentions an
            instance where several were obtained by F pouring water into their burrows. They

            fifty miles in one direction and but ten in another, we have a superficies of five
            hundred square miles; and allowing them to be thirty feet apart, or nine hundred square
            feet for each (a large allowance), it would give about thirty thouand habitations to the
            square mile, or 15,000,000 in the five hundred miles. Estimating but two of these little
            creatures, which is the smallest supposable number to a habita- tion, we have a total of
            thirty millions in this community. I think it would be qtiite safe to reckon three or
            perhaps four animals to each hillock. NATURAL HISTORY. 559 mals feeding on it, A few
            scattered mezqiiit trees also grew I among them, Eivers did not limit the colony ; for
            they were found on both sides of several streams. In several places I noticed a colony
            on the summit of elevated plateaus or hills where the countiy was exceedingly barren,
            and the herbage so 1 i I i I scant as to appear entirely inadequate to their
            subsistence. In this case it was evident that the colony was not in a flou- rishing
            condition as many of the habitations were deserted. Of the habits of these animals I can
            say little from obser- vation, although I saw thousands of them, I would gladly have
            taken a day to conceal myself near them for the purpose of watching their actions, but
            when in the* most interesting places we were moving forward. Major Long, in his
            Expedition to the Bocky Mountains says they pass the winter in a lethar- ' gic state.
            Other travellers deny this, and say that they come from their holes during the winter
            whenever the weather IS mud. I saw them out on some pretty cold days in Novem- .0 ber.
            Even in the plains further to the north, where snow lies on the ground for weeks, and
            where the cold is severe, they are seen out during the winter. Where they obtain water
            has puzzled naturalists. Some travellers say that they dig down until they find it. This
            can- not be the case ; for I have seen them on dry elevated plains, twenty miles from
            water, and where there was no dew. The color of the prairie dog is light brown. The
            lower part of its body, with the face and neck, are of a whitish yel- low. Its size
            varies from that of a gray squirrel to that of a northern woodchuck, which it resembles
            in form more than any other animal. The body of a full-grown specimen is about twelve
            inches in length ; its tail, which is bushy, be- tween three and four. It stands erect
            like a squirrel, with its tail in constant motion, particularly when seated upon the top
            of its hillock chirping to its companions. As we drew near their villages, an alarm
            seemed to be given by one placed as a sentinel on a hillock in the outskirts. As soon as
            the siojnal 560 NATURAL HISTORY. was made a general scampering to get home took place
            among thenij some running in one direction some in another. When they reached their
            hahitations they would stand erect at their entrances with their heads just peeping
            above, and keep up an incessant chirping and frisking of their tails until we passed. As
            we drew quite near, some of them would turn a somerset into their holes and disappear.
            We found it difficult to secure them ; for they always stood at the entrance of their
            burrows, so that, if shot, they fell within. I do not think that out of twenty shots
            sometimes fired at these creatures, more than one specimen was obtained. This marmot is
            said to be good food ; but at the time we killed those referred to, our provisions were
            abundant, and no one could be induced to trjthm. Subsequently, when we got on short
            allowance, I do not think any one would have hesi- tated to eat them. Rabbits often
            burrow with these animals, or, what is more probable, they occupy habitations made by
            the latter. The habits of a rabbit lead him to places where there are more shrubs, and
            not a bare plain. It is probable, therefore, that the rabbits seen among the prairie
            dogs are merely wanderers, who have strayed away from their proper abodes, and finding
            comfortable quarters already provided, without the labor of burrowing themselves have
            driven away the weaker animals and taken possession of their dwellings. A small brown
            owl also resides with the prairie dogs, and is almost always found standing on their
            hillocks, acting perhaps as a sentinel, for which the community has to pay dear. He is
            undoubtedly an interloper ; as, from the known habits of this bird, one of which is its
            fondness for ground mice, moles, and other small quadrupeds, it doubtless seeks the ha-
            bitations of the prairie dogs to feed on their young. The parent dogs can have little
            courage to permit a diminutive bird like this to prey upon their ofispring. But the most
            serious interloper in the dog-towns is the. NATURAL HISTORY. 561 i rattlesnake. I had
            often heard that this reptile was fonnd among them, and thought it must be accidental,
            until I wit- nessed how frequently it occurs. On one occasion I saw sev- eral of those
            revolting creatures enter a single hole in the very midst of a dog-town. No one can
            believe that any friendsliip exists between animals of such opposite natures ; and it
            can- not be doubted that the rattlesnake takes up his abode among them for sinister
            purposes. They cannot drive him away, and are therefore compelled to give him quiet
            possession of any habitation he may enter, and allow him occasionally to feed upon the
            junior members of the fraternity. I have seen the praii'ie dogs in Texas, New Mexico,
            Chi- huahua, Sonora, and California. During our various journeys we encountered numerous
            herds of antelopes on the plains. Several were shot and found to be excellent eating.
            They are more timid than the deer, a a good deal of stratagem is necessary to secure
            one. The antelope is considered a more beautiful animal than the deer. Its legs are more
            slender, and its body of different colors, light and dark brown, red with a white belly,
            spotted, 9-iid sometimes pure white. Their horns are quite short and consist of a simple
            curved stem without branches. Catlin, I think, in his Wild Sports of the West, speaks of
            the curiosity the antelope's disposition, and of a method resorted to by hunt cloth This
            is to affix a piece of red :he earth. The animals see it s they bound over the prairie,
            turn from their course, and timidly approach it, some venturous buck leading the way.
            The rest of the herd follow him in single file, after the old es- tablished custom of
            the prairies. In the mean time the hunt- grass Approaches, he selects the fattest for
            his mark. It sometimes happens that several are thus killed from a single herd. One pf

            they approached he shot VOL. II. — 3G 562 NATURAL HISTORY. one. The frightened animals
            ran a short distance and then stopped and turned round to see what the mysterious noise
            was that had so alarmed them. They even returned to the spot where their dead comrade
            lay. A second shot hrought another to the ground. The herd, again startled at the report
            of the rifle J loped slowly away a short distance and once more returned to the fatal
            spot, when another was brought down. The sportsman now rose from his place of
            concealment and secured his three animals. How long they would have con- tinned to
            return, I know not. He had but three bullets with him. In some parts of Texas deer are
            so abundant that it ceases to be a sport to kill them. Jf either skill nor ingenuity is
            re- quired, and even the usual caution of the practised sportsman is unnecessary. Such
            is the case on the lower road from San Antonio to El Paso, at a stream called Turkey
            Creek. Here the train stopped one day to rest, when twenty deer were killed and brought
            to camp. After leaving the Kio Grande we found none until we reached the Eio Mimbres,
            where again they became numerous. Beyond that we found them in the moun- tains and along
            the bottom-lands of the Gila, but not in large Jiumbers. On the whole game, both animals
            and birds, was scarce throughout the broad regions traversed by us, except in the
            mountain districts, where it was abundant. In California, however, after reaching the
            rich valleys and timbered country it is found in still greater quantity and variety ;
            but my .«tay was so short there, and my journeys confined to so limited a district, that
            I am unprepared to testify except to the general fact, la noticing the distribution of
            animals over the desert regions which occupy so large a space of the interior of our
            con- tinent, it will have been observed how beautifully nature has adapted them for
            these districts. Here man, the terror of all animals, cannot live ; for there is no soil

            to supply him with fuel ; nor can the domestic animals so necessary to him exist. But
            while these inferior animals have such undisputed sway unmolested hy man their lives are
            nevertheless attended with other dangers. It might he supposed that the venom of the
            tarantula the centipede, the scorpion, and the rattlesnake would effectually preserve
            them from all enemies. But such IS not the case. A most voracious bird is found here,
            called by the Mexicans the jaysoMO' and by the Americans the cliapporal cocky' which
            feeds on these liideous creatures. He even ventures to attack the rattlesnake, and, as
            if aware of the latter's venom, protects himself from its fangs by using his wmg as a
            shield. Many instances have been related to me by Gye-witnesses of contests between the
            rattlesnake and this bird, in which the latter always came off conqueror. His aim is to
            seize the reptile by the back of his neck, when he may be con- sidered as van(][uislied.
            With the exception of this bird and the hog, every animal has an instinctive dread of
            rattle- snakes, and wdll fly at their approach. The hog eats them with inipunity. Other
            dangers attend these reptiles from crows, buzzards, and hawks ; while the serpent, tribe
            get their living on the lizards and frog's. Anotlier peculiarity of tlie desert is its
            remartable vegeta- tion ; every thing being armed with thorns. First comes the endless
            variety of cacti, to look at some of which will make one shudder. These are seen from
            the tiny plant not larger tban the finger to the giant petahaya raising its tall stem to
            the height of fifty feet. Then come the mezquit or acacia, the tornilla, the fouquiera,
            the agaves, and yuccas, all armed with the most terrific spikes or thorns. Even among
            the tender grasses, the mezquit has its minute thorns. But these thorny and angular
            forms are not confined to animal and vegetable Kfe : they seem to be extended to nature
            even in the grandest aspect in which she here appears. The mountain ridges, as I have
            before observed, present the most singular summits, 564 NATURAL HISTORY, terminating in
            pyramidal points, or resembling towers, mina- rets, etc. Thus is every tiling in these
            regions peculiar. To indemnify man for the inhospitable deserts and barren soil which
            occupies so large a space, nature furnishes, embowelled in her innumerable mountains,
            the greatest variety and abund- ance of precious metals. The vast riches embedded in the
            great "Sierra Madre" are as yet little dreamt of; but I do not hesitate to say that for
            wealth of this description even California will yet have to yield the palm to these
            mountains. Without entering into particulars about the variety of fishes brought home, I

            566 ADAPTATIOX OF THE COUNTRY About the parallel of 29 30' the tahle-land breaks off
            into numerous spurs, desceuding to the great plains or prairies, which extend to the
            -shores of the Gulf of Mexico in a broad belt from one hundred and fifty to two hundred
            miles in width. The whole of this district consists of gently undulat- g the marg and is
            covered with the most luxuriant grass. The eastern portion of this plain is watered by
            numerous streams, and in fertility is unsurpassed by any portion of the globe. The
            western and south-western portion is deficient in water-courses. The Rio Grrande
            possesses few tributaries here worth notice ; and south of the Nueces, the streams
            entering into the Gulf are cjuite diminutive. But for grazing and rearing large herds of
            cattle, the land is unsurpassed ; and it is evident, from what we saw of wells sunk in
            the midst of these plains, that water can be found any where within a hundred feet of
            the surface. The indigenous prairie grass is tall, coarse, full of seed at the top, and
            when young resembles wheat in the' spring. But in grasses the glory of the State is the

            in nar- row strips along the water-courses ; but these cannot with propriety be termed
            forests. There are also valleys between parallel ranges of mountains, sometimes two or
            three miles in width, which derive some moisture from the mountains, where * FOR A

            appears only at intervals. The high table-land of Chihuahua exhibits it in the greatest
            quantity ; but even there it is not continuous. Sometimes it is found spreading over
            districts fifty or more miles in extent, when a barren interval of thorny chapporal
            appears, and for miles a blade of grass is not to be seen. Upon the whole I feel safe in
            saying that of the ele- . vated platepu not more than two thirds can be called a graz-

            stream which is as large as the Kio Grande, and has many tributaries, discharges itself
            into that river. It is in that por- tion of Chihuahua which forms the eastern slope of
            the Sierra Madre, as I have before said, that the best arable and tim- bered land is to
            be found. This, for a mountainous district, is well watered. The district south of the
            river Gila, between the Rio Grande and the Pacific, for about one hundred and fifty
            miles m width, is of the most barren character. The summit of the great ridge or plateau
            is covered with a short grass. On leaving this and proceeding westward come broad
            plains, nthbut little vegetation, save the stunted mezquifc and other plants common to
            these arid regions." This broad belt extends to the Pacific, and is crossed at intervals
            of from fifteen to miles b one thousand to two thousand feet above the plain, running
            from nortb-west to soutb-east. These at a distance appear like a continuous chain ; but
            on approaching them, they are found to be in short ridges from five to ten miles in
            length, over- lapping each other and affording easy passages across. In this respect
            'these chains diflr from the mountain ranges both at 568 ADAPTATION OF THE COUNTRY the
            north and at the south. Coming from the north, they present but few openings until they
            reach the parallel of about 32 40'j where they suddenly fall off eight miles south of
            Fort Webster and disappear entirely. At Fort Webster/"* between the Gila and the Eio
            Grande, these mountains attain a height of more than cis;ht thousand feet above the
            level of the sea.f They rise in peaks separated by narrow and intricate valleys and
            maintain this character until they terminate on the pla- teau, as stated. This plateau
            extends southwardly through the greater 2:)ortion of Mexico. In about the latitude of
            31° 15' north the great Cordillera range again begins to appear on the western border of
            the table-land, and is as it were the concentration of many lesser ridges into one vast
            chain, elevated, compact, and impassable, extending through the entire length of New
            Mexico to the Cordillera qf the Andes in South America. The wagon road of Colonel Cooke,
            followed by the Commission, crosses a spur of the Sierra Madre here. A second pass, for

            impassable mountains. After this they appear only at intervals, and not in continuous

            openings through them. No stream enters the Gila on the south side after the San Pedro
            is passed. There is a small water-course known as the Santa Cruz River whieh rises in
            some springs near the sources of the San Pedro, and which, after a course of less than a
            hundred miles, is lost in the desert near Tucson. Xear this are good lands, which by
            irrigation are rendered fertile. We have, therefore, a sjiace of about two hundred and
            fifty miles Without a water-course or arable valley except the Santa Cruz, and nearly
            one hundred and sixty miles before any consider- able stream is reached at the south, in
            the State of Sonora. This wide region is of the most barren and desert -hke character,
            consisting of arid plains, with short and detached ridges of mountains at long
            intervals. ' The water-courses of Sonora take their rise in the Sierra Madre and in the
            mountains at the north. Those which rise in the former receiving a more copious and
            constant supply of water, reach the ocean ; while the streams in the northern por- tion
            of the State, after traversing arid deserts, and forcing their way through lofty
            mountains for three or four himdred niiles, lose so much by evaporation that they do not
            reach the sea, but are swallowed up in the sands of the desert or ciene- gas (marshes).
            These streams lose much, too, by irrigating the cultivated valleys through which they
            run. Except along the bottom-lands of these streams, there is no arable land in Sonora.
            What there is, however, is exceed- ingly fertile, and yields enormous crops. Owing to
            the rapid descent of the streams, the water is easily controlled and con- ducted by
            irrigating canals over the arable lands: so that every considerable land-owner may have
            his own canals. In the northern portion of the State, near the Gila, there is but little
            tillable land. The best portion of it is that occupied by the Pimo and Coco-Maricopa
            Indians. In portions of the Santa Cruz and San Pedro valleys are good lands, but the « '
            4 570 ADAPTATION OF THE COUNTRY quantity is small ; and tlie latter is rather a grazing
            than an agricultural district. In about the latitude of 31* the water-courses of
            northern Sonora begin to appear and with them the luxuriant valleys, through several of
            which I found my way across the country to the Gulf. Those streams though denominated
            rivers, would scarcely be characterized as such in the United States ; the term rivulet
            would be far more appropriate. As regards the construction of a railway through Texas,
            the country is entirely open and generally level. The first elevation to be passed,
            following the parallel of 32 degrees, is Castle Mountain, about ten miles east of the
            river Pecos, which may be avoided by diverging either to the north or south. After
            crossing the Pecos, the route should be south of the Guadalupe range of mountains, a
            lofty and continuous chain, which, coming from the north where it is united by the
            Sacramento range, terminates abruptly in about 3P 50" north latitude. South of these
            mountains, the country is qiiite open and apparently level, with isolated mountains at
            long inter- vals, but no connected chains. For the hundred miles which we followed the
            Pecos, there were neither hills nor mountains and this character of country extends to
            the Rio Grande. A mountain chain, called the " Sierra de los Organos,"' crosses this
            river near El Paso, and extends north for some eighty miles. These mountains may easily
            be passed through where the river has opened a way for itself near El Paso, and again
            about forty miles to the north. But suneys must determine whether, in coming from the
            Mississippi, a route near the parallel of 32 ) more practicable. After crossing the Piio
            Grande, should a point north of El Paso, between the latitude of 31° 53' and 32 20' be
            selected. there is an open country for more than one hundred miles Some mountain ranges

            scarcely perceived. After they are passed, broad, open, and level plains occur, where
            for miles very slight embankments or excava- tions will be required for the constraction
            of a road. If, on examination, it is not deemed advisable to cross the Kio Grande within
            the district named, we must then strike it about twenty-five miles farther south, near
            San Eleazario, theuce across the basin of that river to the table-land beyond and south
            of the mountains which lie west of El Paso. Broad level plains again occur here without
            any continuous moun- tain chain. An idea has arisen that the line of Colonel Cooke's
            road is a practicable one for a railway. This is a great mistake. That road crosses a
            spur of the Sierra Madre with a descent of from twelve to fifteen hundred feet in ten
            miles, all of which is avoid- ed by keeping some ten or twenty miles to the north. In
            fact, ny route with the engineering parties across this district, as detailed in this
            narrative, diverging occasionally a few miles, will be found a practicable one. The
            first barrier of consequence, of which I cannot speak Nvith certainty, is a range of
            mountains beyond the San Pedro river, bounding the Santa Cruz valley on the east. They
            termi- nate in latitude 31 15' where our parties passed them. Be- tween 32° and 32 22'
            they are passed by wagons, but I cannot state with wdiat facility. If an opening exists
            any where between the 32d parallel and the Grila, the last obstacle to reaching the
            plateau near that river is overcome. Here is an open level plain, from one hundred to
            one hundred and twenty miles across, to the river.mentioned. In fact, it may be said
            that when the San Pedro Mountains are passed, we shall have an uninterrupted plain of
            about two hundred and fifty miles to the Colorado. It will thus appear, that the entire
            district from the Kio Orande to the Colorado, which may be put in round numbers t five
            hundred miles, consists of broad, open, gravelly plains, from fifteen to twenty-five
            miles in width, with scarcely an un- »* 572 ADAPTATION OF THE COUNTRY diilatioiij and
            for long distances requiring but slight excava- tions and embankments. The mountains may
            be passed through open defiles of easy ascent and descent. When the Gila is reach- ed,
            either the bottom or the table land may be followed ; though the latter will doubtless
            have the preference, as it presents a per- fectly hard and level surface. In a few
            instances, ranges of moun- tains approach the bottom-land of the Gila. Openings may
            doubtless be found through these, or they may be passed by cutting away near the river.
            The Colorado Eiver presents no difficulties for bridging. At Fort Yuma, where the Gila
            joins it, it is about six hun- dred feet wide, but above and below the junction, it
            expands to eight hundred and twelve hundred feet. In dry seasons there is between four
            and five feet of water at Fort Yuma. After this river is passed we reach the great
            California Desert, about one hundred miles across, which increases m width towards the
            north. This desert is destitute of wood, water, and grass ; it presents a hard level
            surface with slight undulations, and seems almost graded by nature for a railway. After
            leaving the bottom or valley, of the Colorado, and before the table-land or desert is
            reached, there is a belt of moving sand. Its southern extremity is now about twelve
            miles below Fort Yuma, where I passed it with my parties without cross- ing it. Its
            breadth is about four, and its entire length, less than twenty miles. This is the only
            belt of moving sand that I know or within the district referred to, west of the Rio

            places, which are filled with water at times, by the overflows of the Colorado. In
            these, hj sinking wellsj a plentiful supply of water can doubtless be procured. Should
            the route of which I am speaking be selected for a railway, supplies could be furnished
            at several places on the line after leaving the settled portions of Texas. New Mexico
            and the valley of the Eio Grande would furnish cattle, sheep, mules, flour, and com. The
            valley of the Casas Grandes in Chihuahua, is one of the finest wheat and corn districts
            in the country, and Sonora could furnish an abundance of cattle, wheat, corn, and beans.
            Supplies may also be taken to the line of the road by the Gulf bf California and the
            Colorado Rivei\ The latter, although it has from four to five feet of water near the
            junction when lowest, is somewhat obstructed by sand-bars towards its mouth ; but I have
            no doubt that steamers, with a light draught of water, may ascend, the greater portion
            of the year, even for a distance a hundred miles above Fort Yuma. The Gila can never be
            navigated except in time of floods or high water, when flat-bottomed boats might
            possibly pass up to the Salinas, one hundred and eighty miles above its mouth. Supplies
            might be sent, as is now proposed, to Fort Yuma, by sailing vessels to the head of the
            Grulf of California, and thence by a small steamer up the Colorado. I have spoken of
            desert, woodless plains on the line near the parallel of 32. It is proper to remark that
            any route south of the parallel of 35, must cross the great Llajio Estacado east of the
            Rocky Mountains, which increases much in width above the 32d parallel. I crossed it
            about 31° 30' or from the head waters of the Concho to the Horse Head Crossing on the
            Pecos, a distance of seventy miles, without but a deg width is more doubled. Then the
            region between the Pecos and the Piio Grande is equally barren (so far as known), and
            must also be crossed by any route south of the 35th parallel « i 574 ADAPTATION OF THE
            COUNTRY So with the great Cahforma desert west of the Colorado ; all routes south of the
            3Gth parallel must cross this, even though the Mohavi Eiver be followed, unless the
            explorations V now being made should discover some valley or stream not yet known. Some
            observations are necessary respecting timber and other materials requisite for the
            construction of a railway. Forests and timbered lands extend from the basin of the Mis-
            sissippi through eastern Texas, and on the slopes leading to the table-land, where they
            are limited to the margin of the streams. The next are found in the Gruadalupe range of
            mountains, as well as in defiles leading to it, or following a more northerly line, in
            the Sacramento range. Both pine and oak exist here in abundance. Next, we have the open
            plains to the Organ Mountains, a chain running north and south about fifteen miles east
            of the Eio Grande, Here both oak and pine timber are found. Proceeding west across the
            Kio Grande, the supply of timber must be obtained from the Rocky Mountains in the
            vicinity of the Copper Mines (FortWebster). Beyond this, north of the 32d parallel,
            there are no elevated mountains, and hence no pines. The mountain defiles are filled
            with oaks of a small size, and the margin of arroyos and streams with cotton- woods. In
            the valley of the Santa Cruz, between Tubac and San- ta Cruz, are very considerable

            regions where there is no timber, would furnish an abundant sujply of these roots. The
            experiment is worth trying. With regard to water, there are certain indications, even in
            the most desert regions, by which experienced travellers gener- ally find it by digging.
            It may be found, too, in every moun- tain range, and in great depressions on the plains
            by digging or boring. An examination of the map, or of this narrative, will show what
            running streams or springs exist, from which to obtain a supply. From these brief
            remarks, it will be seen that the advan- tages of the southern route for a railway, are
            an open and remarkably level country from the Mississippi to the Sierra Nevada of
            California — a summit level a thousand feet less than that of the other routes (so far
            as known) — entire freedom from snows — and convenience in obtaining supplies. The
            disad- vantages are adeficiency of timber, water, and food for animals; and the want of
            tillable lands for settlements and farms. ] 5 576 INTRODUCTION OF CAMELS INTRODUCTION OF

            Prairies and Deserts of the Interior. In traversing the broad plains and deserts of the
            interior of the continent, the subject of using camels as a means of transpor- tation
            oftened occurred to me ; and on my return, I learned that the subject of introducing
            them had been discussed in the newspapers, and that a resolution had been offered in
            Con- gress, asking for an appropriation to test the experiment. A memoir on the subject,
            at considerable length, written with much ability, and embracing a vast number of
            curious, interesting, and important facts, by George E. Gliddon, Esq., was laid before
            the Committee on Military Affairs of the Sen- ate. This committee asked for an
            appropriation to enable the Secretary of War to import thirty camels and twenty drome-
            daries of various breeds, together with ten Arabs, familiar with their habits, whose
            services might be retained for two years. ' The plan proposed was to send an efficient
            agent to Eg}'?*, who was to proceed to the interior of the country, as far as Nubia, and
            there procure the finest specimens of the best breeds ; for the camel, like the horse
            and the ox, presents many varie- ties. On the African coast these animals are found in
            great numbers ; but they are said to be inferior to those of the in- terior. If the
            experiment is to be fairly tested and made a Government undertaking, of course the very
            best breeds, both from Africa and Asia, should be obtained • INTRODUCTION OF CAMELS. 577

            at various times the deserts of Arabia and northern Africa. Mr. Criiddon, knowing the
            interest I felt in this subject, and that ■1 had had some experience in my various

            saving to animal life, and would present facilities for crossmg our broad deserts and

            entirely unknown to tlie cultivated people of Carthage, through all the centuries of
            their flourishing existence, until the destruction of the city. It was first brought
            into use for the armies by the Marusians, in Western Lybia, in the time of the Ciesars;
            perhaps in consequence of its employment in commercial undertakings by the Ptolemies, in
            the valley of the Nile. The Guanches inhabiting the Canary Islands, who were probably
            related to the Berber race, were not acquainted with the camel before tlie fifteenth
            century, when it -was introduced by Norman conquerors 'ind settlers. In the probably
            very limited commimication of the Guanches with the coast of Africa, the smallness of
            their boats must necessainly have im- peded the transport of large animals. The true
            Berber race, which was diffused throughout the interior of Northern Africa, is probably
            indebted to the use of the camel, throughout the Lybian desert and its oases, not only
            for the advan- tages of internal communication, but also for its escape from complete
            annihi- hUiou and for the maintenance of its national existence to this day. The use of
            the camel continued, on the other hand, to be unknown to the negro races ; and it was
            only in company with the conquering expeditions and proselyting missions of the Bedouins
            through the whole of Northern Africa, that the useful animal of the Nedschd, of the
            Nabathean?, and of all the districts occupied by the Aramean races, spread here, as
            elsewhere, to the westward. The Goths brought the camels as early as the fourth century
            to the Lower Istros(the Dan- ube), and the Ghaznevides transported them in much larger
            numbers to India as etr as the banks of the Ganies.* Other authorities agree as to the
            comparatively recent introduction of the camel and dromedary into Northern Afi-ica.
            Baron Humboldt distinguishes two epochs in their distribution there, "the first under
            the Ptolemies, which operated, through Cyrene, on the whole of the north-west coast, and
            the second under the Mohammedan epoch of the conquering Arabs; " f while the dromeda-
            O'* iow so much in use, was only propagated in the region of Algiers as late as the
            middle of the sixteenth century. A number of curious facts have been brought together by
            Mr, Gliddon, to show that the camel was not used in the earliest Egyptian times ; the
            most sat- isfactory evidence of which is, that it does not appear on any of the
            Pharaonic monuments: a conclusion to which Champollion-Figeac had arrived. "But one
            thing worthy of remark," says that distinguished archaeologisty "is that there is not
            found on any monument the figure or mention of the camel; a native of Arabia. This
            valuable animal appears to have been unknown to the ancient Egyptians for service."

            distribution of the camel in the Old "World, is that of the distinguished geographer and
            ethnologist Karl Fitter, who in his great work has devoted 150 pages to the histoiy of
            this quadruped. I shall merely quote the results of his investigations to show the wide
            extent of the present diffusion of the camel. These natural limits are establisheJ as
            follows : — '* Towards eastern and south-eastern Asia, by the tropical, sultry,
            maritime, Indian, and Farther Indian climate of the Elepha7it-land and fluvial zone of
            the Cocoa-forests; — towards the north on the Upper Jenesei, Baikal, and Irtysh, by the
            lieindeer-zone of the sub-polar climate of 58 to 56' North Latitude;— beyond the flat
            steppedands of the nomadic tribes, hj agriculture upon the European culture-gronnd, with
            the fixed dwellings of its inhabitants. In the Maghreb, or northern half of the African
            continent, the Lybian camel- zone, towards the north (from the Erythran East to the
            Atlantic West), is exhibited without limits as far as the Berber races, as well as Moors
            and Bedou- ins, inhabit the Sahara and the Oases, But south of that it is limited by the
            zone of tropical rains, or the wet season, along the valleys of the Senegal, the Niger
            system, and the Bahr el-Ahiad Here the expanse of sand and gravel changes into a
            luxuriant, thickly-wooded, fruit-bearing soil, subject to inunda- tion, before which the
            organization of this desert-animal shrinks back, and where begins the belt of the
            central Negro States of Soudan, or the Land of the Blacks, with whom asses and bullocks,
            as universal beasts of transport, thrive, being better suited to the climate, or where

            Kuenleen ; over the black plateau of Upper Asia, and the scorching plains of Hindostan ;
            skirt- ing the shores of the Indian Ocean, the Yellow, the Caspian, and the Black seas,
            " winter or summer, he resignedly plods his weary way," burdened with whatever load his
            master places on his back. He is much used in eastern Europe ; and in Africa, across its
            entire breadth, from the shores of the Medi- terranean to the region of the tropical
            rains. Taking a portion of the North American Continent cor- responding with the camel
            zone of the old world, the most extreme northern limits of the United States would be
            conge- nial to him. But we should not require his services north of Missouri, or about
            the 40th parallel. From thence, southward to the Gulf of Mexico, but particularly in
            Texas, the climate would be most congenial to him. The high table-lands of Texas, New
            Mexico, Utah, Sonora, Chihuahua, Durango, and portions of Central Mexico, are equally
            adapted to him. The entire route from the Mississippi to California, particularly that
            south of Santa Fe by the Gila, where there are no moun- tains to cross ; and also, the
            great highway over the table-hmds of Mexico, are well adapted to his habits. But he
            would be jom brackish will not drink it. There are peculiarities in the arid plains and
            deserts of North America which seem to fit them for the habits of the camel. His
            favorite food in Africa is beans and chopped straw. Now, it is a well known fact, that
            however barren our deserts, they abound in mezquit bushes or chapporal, which shrub
            bears a most nutricious bean. Whether this plant attains a height of three feet on the
            desert or twenty in the bottom-lands, it is equally prolific. Mules and cattle feed on
            582 INTRODUCTION OF CAMELS. them when they cannot get grass or corn ; yet they never
            thrive on them, but on the contrary, lose flesh. Other pecu- harities are the salines
            and salt lakes, which abound on the arid plains throughout the table-lands, as well as
            on the slopes towards both oceans. When driven to great extremities, mules will
            sometimes drink this salt or brackish water ; but I have driven them fifty or sixty
            miles without water, yet on reaching a saline not one in ten would touch it. To camels
            brackish water is as acceptable as if from the purest foun- tains. " Frugal in
            appetite/' says Mn Gliddon, the camel's epi- curism never rises above a sufficiency of
            split beans and chop- ped straw ; but while in the vernal season he relishes clover and
            grasses, his massive grinders, cutting like cold chisels, masticate alike the dry est
            stalks or the toughest thorns ; and his cast-iron ' stomach digests and converts into
            nutriment stems otherwise so devoid of succulence, that the camel sub- sists where every
            other gramnivore must starve. When neces- sary, he can go five days without water. With
            us. the food we Khali have to 7 knov which prairies, the elevated table-lands, and the
            mountains. For more solid food we have the Mexican frijoles and maize, with other
            cereals. On the deserts there are plants which mules will not touch, which the camel
            would doubtless feed upon. With regard to the capacities of camels for carrying bur-
            dens all depends upon the breed. " Six hundred pounds," says Mr. Gliddon, " is a fair
            estimate for the best Arabian th which The of enduring heat, will carry ordinarily eight
            hundred pounds. Dromedaries, which are not employed for carrying burdens, but for

            he pushed, with this same weighty double the distance ; but then the jolting is
            increased with the speed of the animal, and could only be borne by experienced riders/'
            Colonel Shiel, an experienced British ofiicer, long versed in military service in
            Hindostan, says the dromedary "is able to travel in all situa- and plains, blazing sun,

            It is proper to state that in hot countries the earners hair IS clipped close, while in

            it attains a lenoh of six inches. Hence he can live in the region of the reindeer as
            well as in that of the lion. This animal is therefore used exclusively, from the Nile to
            the Ganges, for the purpose of war and expresses, or duties requiring expedition ; and
            instances are on record where war parties of Bedouin Arabs, hghtly equipped, with a

            designate the boundary line with due precision, upon authoritative maps, and to
            establish upon the ground land-marks which shall show the limits of both Republics, as
            described in the present arti- cle, the two governments shall each appoint a
            commissioner and a sur- veyor, who, before the expiration of one year from the date of
            the ex- change of ratifications of this treaty, shall meet at the port of San Diego, and
            proceed to run and mark the said boundary in its whole coui'se to the mouth of the Eio
            Bravo del Norte, They shall keep journals, and make out plans of their operations ; and
            the result agreed upon by them shall be deemed a part of this treaty, and shall have the
            same force as if it were inserted therein. The governments will amicably agree regard-
            ing what may be necessary to these persons, and also as to their respec- tive escorts,
            should such be necessary. *' The boundary line established by this article shall be
            religiously respected by each of the two Piepublics ; and no change shall ever be tnade
            therein, except by the express and free consent of both nations, lawfully given by the
            general government of each, in conformity with its own constitution. Official
            Instriictions from tlie Department of the Interior to John R. Bartlett, Commissioner on
            the aW of the United States for running and marhing the Boundary line letweenthe United
            States and the Eejptiblic of Mexico, Department of the Intzriok, August 1. 1850. Sir: In
            a letter from the Department, bearing date of June 10, 1850, you were informed tht you
            had been appointed Commissioner APPENDICES. 589 ■ J. J on the part of tlie United States
            for running and marking the boundarj line between the United States and the Republic of
            Mexico, under the j fifth article of the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. I Bj the documents
            in this department, copies of which have been placed in your possession, or to which you
            have had access, you Vi\\{ perceive that that portion of the boundary between the
            junction of the Gila with the Colorado and the Pacific Ocean has already been run by
            your predecessor. By the same documents it also appears that the Joint Commission in
            February last mutually agreed to suspend their operations, and meet on the first day of
            November next, at El Paso, on the Rio Grande, and resume their operations westward from
            that point. You will, therefore, in conformity with that agreement, proceed, with the
            Commission appointed to perform the duties of running the boun- dary mentioned, to El
            Paso, by the nearest and most convenient route, so as to reach there by the first of
            November. As the organization of the Commission on the part of the United States has
            been made with a view to other objects beyond that of run- nmg the boundary, it becomes
            necessary to call your attention to the duties required. By the sixth article of the
            Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, provision is made for the collection of information
            relative to the construction of a " road, canal, or railway, which shall, in whole or in
            part, run upon the river Gila, or upon its right or left bank, within the space of a
            marine league from either margin of that river." And that " should it be found
            practicable and advantageous to construct such a road, the governments of both Republics
            will form an agreement regarding its construction, in order that it may serve equally
            for the use and advantage of both countries." As the examinations to be made, and the
            information to be collect- ?d, agreeably to this article, are of very great importance,
            you will mate such an organization of parties, and assign to them such duties, as will
            be productive of the desired result. The boundary line where you will commence your
            labors begins at the '= point where the Rio Grande strikes the southern boundar}- of New
            Mexico ; then westward, along the whole southern boundary of New Mexico (which runs
            north of the town called Paso) to its western termi- nation ; thence northward, along
            the western line of New Mexico, until it intersects the first branch of the river Gila
            (or if it should not intersect b r 590 APPENDICES. any branch of tliat river, tlien to
            the point on the said line nearest to ■ r such branch, and then in a direct line to the
            same "). This portion of the line can only be ascertained by examinations and surveys
            upon the ground. You will, however, receive important aid in the determination of this
            Kne, as the treaty expressly declares that " the southern and western limits of iNTew
            Mexico, mentioned in this article, are those laid down on the maps of the United Mexican
            States, published at N"ew York in 1847 by J. Disturnell," a certified copy of which was
            appended to the treaty, bearing the signatures and seals of the plenipo- tentiaries. You
            are furnished with a certified copy of this map. The remainder of the boundary runs
            along the middle of the River Gila and the Rio Grande ; of the former, from the point
            where the west- ern line of ]N"ew Mexico intersects it to its junction with the Colorado
            ; and the latter, from the point intersected by the southern line of New Mexico near El
            Paso, to its mouth. As the organization of tlie Commission under your charge has been
            made for the purpose of collecting information relative to the country contiguous to the
            boundary lino, in addition to the running of that line, it is desirable that you should
            avail yourself of every opportunity afford- ed by your passage through the unexplored
            regions of Texas, New Mexi- co, and California, to acquire information as to its
            geography, national history, etc., when it can be obtained without retarding the progress
            of the boundary survey. You are, therefore, at liberty to send out explor- ing parties,
            when not otherwise employed on the survey of the line, to examine the country north of
            the Gila, as well as on either side of the Rio Grande, for the above and kindred
            purposes. It is stated, on the authority of persons who have traversed the coun- try
            near the river Gila, that during a considerable portion of the summer there is neither
            grass nor water to be obtained. Should the Commis- sion be in this region at this
            season, it may be compelled to suspend its operations. In such an event, your party may
            be usefully employed in geographical and scientific explorations in the regions before
            alluded to. The collection of information relative to the precious metals, quick-
            silver, and the various minerals, ores, and other substances, useful in the arts, is
            very desirable. In reference to the existence and localities of these, as well as the
            locations of mines formerly worked by the early set- tlers in California and New Mexico,
            and since abandoned, owing to the incursions of the Indians, or other causes, you will
            do all in your power i i ] APPENDICES. 591 to acquire information as far as you may bo
            able, without impeding the main objects of the Commission. After you have traced the
            boundary to the junction of the Gila with the Colorado, you will be compelled to retrace
            your steps to El Paso, Before doing this, as you will possess many facilities for the
            purpose, you are at liberty to proceed up the Colorado River, and make such ex-
            plorations as your time and facilities will permit, provided the boundary survey is not
            arrested in so doing. Tlie discovery of more practicable routes through California for
            emi- grants, is desirable. The present routes, by way of the Great Salt Lake and the
            River Gila, are attended with many difficulties. If a portion of the Commission can be
            spared, with an adequate escort, to seek such routes, while it is in their vicinity, you
            are at liberty to employ them* As it is indispensable that each government should be
            furnished with a full and circumstantial record of the proceedings of the Commissioners,
            they will doubtless order such to be kept in duplicate. This duty will devolve upon the
            clerks or secretaries appointed on both sides, who will be responsible for the accuracy
            of such records, and for their safe deliv- ery, properly certified, to the respective
            governments, at the expiration of the Commission. As soon as the boundary shall have
            been ascertained arid marked, you will cause a true and accurate map to be made of the
            country through which it passes, in its entire extent. A duplicate copy of said map,
            certified by the commissioners and surveyois on both sidesj should accompany the records
            of the proceedings of the Commission. The joint report of declaration by the
            commissioners "of the final result agreed upon by them,'* under the fifth article of the
            treaty, will also be transmitted to the department, to be filed with the journal or
            record of their proceedings and the maps. Your salary as commissioner, which has been
            fixed by Congress, at three thousand dollai*s, will commence on the fourteenth day of
            June 1850, the day of your appointment by the President, when you were ordered to report
            yourself for duty to this department Under the head of contingent expenses of the
            Commission, will be embraced your rea- sonable personal and travelling expenses while in
            service, and those of the principal suiTeyor, chief astronomer, and other officers of
            the topo- graphical engineers and navy who may be detailed to assist you in the field,
            or otherwise; the pay and subsistence of assistant surveyors and 592 APPENDICES.
            draughtsmen, chain-carriers, mechanics, laborers, cooks, servants, and guides, and the
            incidental and necessary expenses of exploring parties ; the pay and subsistence of
            secretaries, surgeon, quarter-master, commis- sary, assistants, and clevts ; the
            purchase of an outfit, including horses, mules, tents, and camp-equipage, arms and
            ammunition, books and stationery, instruments, medical stores, boats, mechanics' tools,
            wagons, and vehicles for the transportation of the Commission, and its stores by sea or
            otherwise ; the purchase of articles for presents to, or traffic with, the Indians,
            clothing for the men (to be repaid by them) ; and the pur- chase and fixing of monuments
            to mark the boundary line- Of all these expenses you will keep a regular account, which,
            together with the neces- sarj vouchers, you will render and transmit quarterly to the
            Fifth Au- ditor of the Treasury, for settlement. And to meet the same, as likewise the
            payment of the salaries, you will from time to time, as occasion may require, draAv upon
            the Department, taking care not to exceed in the amount drawn at any one time the sum
            which will be required to meet the necessary and actual expenses of the Commission. You
            will be charged exchisivcly with the disbursement of the money appropriated to pay the
            expense of the Commission. As soon as the Commission is filled, you will transmit to
            this Depart- ment a list containing the names of the several persons composing it, the
            nature of the duties assigned to each individual, and the compensa- tion allowed to them
            respectively ; and will also, from time to time, in- form the Secretary of the Interior
            of any change which you may by circumstances be induced to make in its organization. In
            organizing for duty, you are referred, for any information whicl you may deem necessary,
            to Andrew B. Gray, Esq. who has been ap- pointed Surveyor under the treaty, and to
            Brevet Lieut. Colonel John McClellan, of the Topographical Engineers, whom the President
            has desig- nated as " Chief Astronomer and Head of the Topographical Scientific Corps of

            the Interior explanatory of the foregoing. Depautmext of the Ixtertor, • November 4,
            1851, Sir : As some misunderstanding has arisen with regard to the instruc- tions
            communicated in my letter of the 23d of October, 1850, I deem it proper to add such
            explanations and modifications as the circumstances seem to demand ; and as Brevet Major
            Wm, H. Emory, the Chief As- tronomer, has been appointed by the President the Surveyor,
            under the treaty, to run and mark the boundary Hne between the United States and Mexico,
            in place of A. B, Gray, Esq., some further explanations re- specting his position and
            duties are necessary. The officers and mem- bers of the scientific corps immediately
            connected with the survey of the boundary line shall be placed under the immediate
            orders of the sur- veyor. Any lines agreed upon by the Joint Commission as the lines of
            boundary, shall be run and astronomically determined by the surveyor. He will have
            charge and direction of all the surveys of the boundary line, and shall determine the
            Initial and intermediate points of the sur- vey by astronomical means, acting under your
            direction. This corps shall consist of such number of assistants as you, upon advising
            with him, may deem absolutely necessary. He shall issue his instructions in writing, and
            shall preserve a copy of them in a book kept for that pur- pose. He shall require
            monthly reports from the heads of parties, and shall place them before you in a
            condensed form. He shall have charge of the surveying and astronomical instruments; and
            for their safe keep- ing, will be responsible to you. He shall be allowed a clerk, whose
            salary shall not exceed that of a sub-assistant. He shall be responsible to you, and
            through you to this department, for as rapid a prosecution of the surveys, and for all
            the astronomy connected with them, as may be consistent with their accuracy ; and will
            be held accountable for all the quarter-master's stores, camp and garrison equipage,
            placed at his disposal. Should any doubts arise between yourself and the Mexican Commis-
            sion, the surveyor shall be required to make such surveys and maps as may tend to
            elucidate the point or line in dispute. Should the surveyor at any time differ with your
            views on any VOL. II. — 38 594 APPENDICES question connected with the survey, etc., he
            will defer to your opinion until the case is submitted to, and decided by the
            department. After the work in the field shall have been completed, the maps shall be
            drawn, under the immediate supervision of the surveyor under your control, on the. scale
            suggested in the instructions to you under the date of October 23, 1850. In the mean
            time, during an inclement sea- son, when the field-work may necessarily be arrested, the
            first plotting (or rough sheets) should be prosecuted. On the completion of the maps,
            they shall be signed by the surveyor, pre\aous to their being authenti- cated by the
            commissioners. No ofBcer but yourself is allowed to draw for any moneys appropri- ated
            for the Mexican Boundary service. The surveyor may draw his sa- lary from this
            department or from you. All the scientific depart- ments not directly connected with the
            surveys of the boundary Une are placed under your immediate direction. The means
            appropriated by Congress being very limited, it is incumbent upon this department to
            order such reductions in the number of persons devoted to the purposes of science as
            your discretion may deem least advantageous. You, as the first officer of the
            Commission, will be held responsible to this depart- ment for the proper administration
            of the great work confided to your charge. I am, etc. Commissioner etc. etc. Esq, ALEX,

            10th, 1852. San Diego, California, January 10th, 1852. Col. : I have the Lonor to report
            ray arrival at San Diego, ith the party of the Boundary Commission under my command.
            Nearly the whole time since you left us upon the San Pedro, until our arrival here, we
            have been upon a short allowance of provisions. "With fourteen and a half days' rations
            of flour, and without an escort, we left St. Peter's Springs upon the Rio San Pedro, on
            the 3d of October, 1851. We arrived at the desired points on the Gila, north- east of
            Fort Graham, on the evening of the 9th, The transit instrument was mounted the same
            night, and both limbs of the moon were observed for longitude. The Topographical survey
            of the Gila, was commenced at this point. My excellent assistants in this portion of the
            work, Henry C, Force and Frank Wheaton, are worthy of great praise for their indus- try
            and skill in the performance of their duties. I should be pleased to have their names
            brought before the Department at Washington, and their merits appreciated. The survey
            was carried on without difficulty below the junction ol Rio San Francisco, as far as the
            entrance to the canon of the Pinal Lleno mountains. Into this we forced our way,
            although Lidians told us that neither man nor beast could pass through. In some places
            by wading, in others by climbing upon the sides of the caiion, which rose
            perpendicularly from five to fifteen hundred feet in height, the survey progressed for
            eight or ten miles. The want of men and of provisions prevented us from sending
            reconnoite ring parties in advance. The train passed over mountains rough and steep upon
            the north side of the riven Having succeeded in reaching a gorge by which a mountain
            stream leaps into the river, we were here compelled to abandon our wagon and lead the

            Cascade Grotto is too wildly beantiful to pass unnoticed. De- scending over twelve
            hundred feet in an hour, we plunged into an In- dian garden, where were melons, maize,
            and beans, and to our surprise a field of cotton. This fertile spot is an inclined
            plain, evidently formed by deposit from a mineral spring, which gushes from the mountain
            irrigates the fields, and then follows a ravine, leaping from cliff to clift, in
            beautiful cascades, until it joins the Gila, which appears in view a thousand feet below
            tlie garden. Passing beneath the first water-fall, one enters a charming stalactite
            cave, consisting of two apartments, richly decorated. At the foot of the precipice are
            flowering shrubs and matted vines, whose red flowers gaily contrast with the surrounding
            ver- dure. This singular formation is filled with petrifactions. In one place was seen
            the trunk of a large cotton-wood tree completely petrified, and cropping out from a bed
            of coarse lime-stone. A chip showed distinctly bark and fibre. From this point the Gila
            was inaccessible ; and having hired an In- dian from the hills, we followed his
            guidance, and reluctantly turned our backs to the river. passed body struck the Gila,
            probably not more than ten miles below the point at which we left it. Having surveyed up
            as far as possible from this place, we then fol- lowed the course of the Gila to the
            mouth of the Rio San Pedro. Here, while observing moon culminations for longitude, we
            sent a party eighty miles to the Pimo village, where flour was purchased. December 9th,
            I met this party on its return. When we arrived at the Pimo village, Colonel Craig, with
            our escort of twenty-three men, and Captain Barry, with about twenty-five days' rations,
            were awaiting us. The banks of the APPENDICES. 599 river from the Pirao settlement to
            the junction of the Eio Salinas, are fertile, producing crops of cotton of the fii*st
            quality. The Maricopas have been driven bythe Yumasfrom their settlement near the Sahnas
            into closer proximity to the Pimos. Within the last year many have been tilled,
            including Juan Antonio Llunas, a Maricopa by birth, but com- mander-in-chief of the
            confederate tribes. If protected from incursions of Apaches, Cuchans, and Yuraas, the
            Maricopas would gladly return to their fertile fields upon the American bank of the Gila
            ; and, in case of an Indian war, they would prove a valuable auxiliary to our troops.
            The Salinas, at its junction, is a beautiful stream, clear as crystal, large as the
            Gila, and, to our surprise, not salt. Having progressed with the topographical survey to
            within about eighty milesof the junction of the Gila with the Colorado, and our supplies
            of provisions failing, we were obliged on tde 14th of December to postpone its
            conclusion until pro- visions could be procured at the army depot at "Camp Yuma." In
            four days we reached the junction. Here, meeting Captain Jimenesand party of the Mexican
            Commission, who had arrived the day previous, to our consternation we learned that the
            military post had been abandon- ed. There was no alternative but to follow the
            soldiei's. Crossing the Colorado, we arrived on the 1st of January, 1852, at Santa
            Isabel, where . Captain Davidson kindly saved us from suffering by hunger. On the 8th of
            January we encamped at San Diego- The agricultural resources of the Gila are of Httle
            value to the United States, more than nine tenths of the soil susceptible of cultivation
            being upon the Mexican bank. Settlements could, however, be supported atthe mouth of the
            San Erancisco, opposite the mouth of the Rio San Pedro, upon the Salinas, and at the
            junction of the Gila with the Colorado. From what pre- cedes it may be inferred that it
            would hardly be practicable to construct "a road, canal, or railway" to run wholly upon
            the river Gila. The Canon of the Pinal Lleiio Mountains is a complete barrier. The Pass
            below the junction of the Rio San Pedro, is equally impracticable. Be- tween the Pimo
            settlements and the junction of the Gila with the Colo- rado, nature interposes no
            serious obstacle to the construction of a way of communication, such as the travelling
            public may demand. But from the Pimo village to the Eio Del Norte, I know of no
            practicable route even for a wagon road, except by entering the State of Sonora to avoid
            the Pinal Lleno Mountains. Possibly a route may be found fol- lowing the course o( the
            Salinas towards Santa Fe. Otherwise, a jor- 600 APPENDICES- nada must be traversed to
            Tucson in Mexico; thence crossing the Rio San Pedro, a road may pass from spring to
            spring — leaving the Guada- lupe "Fass to the south — and may proceed in the vicinity of
            the south- ern boundary of New Mexico to Dona Ana. Four permanent military posts shoukl
            at the same time be established near this route ; one at Col. Craig's " Cantonment
            Da\vson' among the Copper Mines of New Mexico, where a well-watered and fertile valley,
            rich in precious metals would soon support a flourishing settlement; one at the mouth of
            the Eio SanPedrOj where the Pinal Lleno Indians would be intercepted in their marauding
            expeditions to Sonora ; and the third upon the excel- ilent cotton-land: at the mouth of
            the Salinas. The fourth, upon the Co- lorado, has already been established by order of
            the War Department. By treaty stipulations with Mexico, it is solemnly agreed, that all
            in- cursions into her territory of our savage tribes shall be forcibly re- strained by
            the government of the United States. At present, Indian depredations in Sonora are
            notorious. Scores of our own citizens also have been slaughtered by these roving
            robbers, and we have seen their bones bleaching by the road-side. The government is,
            therefore, bound to station a strong military force upon the frontier. Protection to the
            settlrs will enable the resources of the country to be developed ; emi- grants, assured
            of safety and supplies at these depots, will avoid the peril and expense of a sea voyage
            ; and it will soon be seen whether the wants of the people require, so as to render
            advantageous, the construc- tion of a canal or railway which may in part run upon the
            river Gila. The construction of a wagon road by the route proposed through Sonora for
            the use of both countries, would be of no less advantage to Mexico than to the United
            States. An agreement to this effect is, in fact, necessary to the fulfilment of the
            treaty stipulations with reference to the protection of the frontier. This done, and
            some slight encour- agement given to trade, and the now half-depopulated province of
            Sonora will soon become one of the most flourishintr States of Mexico. From the day of
            first striking the Gila to the time of reaching its mouth, seventy days, astronomical
            observations were made every night except two, which were cloudy. The whole number of
            astronomical and meteorological stations upon the Gila were forty-six- Nearly all of
            these were also magnetic stations. Between the mouth of the Gila and 'this place are
            three intermediate astronomical and magnetic stations, aesides those made on my trip
            from San Diego to the Colorado in Sep- J \ APPEXDICES. . 601 I, tembeVj 1849. Thus is
            completed a consecutive chain of magnetic sta- tions extending fi*om the observatory at
            Cambridge, Massachusetts, by ■ way of Grdveston, San Antonio, and El Paso del Norte, to
            the Pacific Ocean. At most of the stations, the three elements, inclination, decHna-
            tion, and intensity have been observed. Hi the astronomical and mag- netic department,
            John O'Donoghue and Hugh Campbell have been my invaluable assistants. The magnetic
            instrument used was made by Mr. George, of Fal- mouth, under the direction of the
            celebrated Mr, Fox, the inventor. It IS the same that was turned over for this service
            by yourself at the close of the North-eastern Boundary survey. With it I observed at
            Chagres, Gorgona, and Panama, in 1849, It is believed that a map exhibiting the results
            obtained will prove of much interest, and when published will add credit to the
            department under which the operation has been conducted. I regi-et that we have not the
            power of embracing the present opportunity — by returning to the United States by way of
            China and the Mediterranean — to sur- round the globe with a series of magnetic
            observations. Not only would the value of the results upon the boundary be greatly
            enhanced by such direct comparison at European observatories, but passing through or
            near the maxima of horizontal intensity, the lines of no vari- ation would be crossed,
            and an exceedingly interesting belt of observa- _ lions might be completed around that
            part of the world, at present, with reference to magnetism, so little known.
            Notwithstanding the recent hostility of the whole tribe of Apaches, Colloteros, Pinal
            Llenos, and Tontos, through which we passed without an escort, nothing but kindness was
            received from them. The Yumas and Cocopas, though glorying in the behef that they had
            driven away the small detachment of United States troops stationed among them, still
            treated us with respect and favor. The vigilance of Colonel Craig gave them no
            opportunity of showing hostility* One sad accident I have to record : the death of
            Thomas Harper, an excellent young man from Kentucky, and a member of wy party. While
            bathing in the Colorado, he was seized ith cramp, sank, and, although a dozen leaped
            into the water to afford assistance, the rapid current bore him beyond reach, and search
            was fruitless. Major Heintzelman is now preparing to establish the military post at the
            Colorado River. Soon as this is done, I hope to be able to ob* 602 APPENDICES tain
            supplies of provisions ; and in ten days after the recommencement of the work, the
            survey of the Gila -vvill he completed. In the mean time, until the arrival of Mr.
            Bartlett, who is supposed to be at Guay- mas, or, while awaiting other means of
            procuring supplies for our re- turn, myself and assistants Sre actively employed in
            completing our observations and plotting the notes of the survey- I remain, Sir, very
            respectfully, Your obedient servant, A. W. WHIPPLE, Lt. U. S. Topogra2hical Engrs. To

            E. Colonel J. D. Graham to the Hon. Alex. S. H. Stuart Secre- tary of tlie Interior in
            reference to the Survey of the Head Waters of the Gulf of California and the River
            Colorado hy Lieutenant I. G, Strom U. S. Navy. "WASmXGTON, The Honorable the Secretary
            of the Department of the Interior having referred to me (for my views of the measures
            therein suggested) the letter of Lieutenant L G. Strain, of the navy, of the 31st of
            October last, and the papers accompanying it, I have the honor to state that I have
            perused them all with attention, and that I feel obliged to give it wi gested by
            Lieutenant Strain have no relation whatever to the survey and demarkatlon of the
            boundary under the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo ; and that they ought not in any way to
            be connected therewith. I have made a careful calculation of the length of boundary line
            to be sur- veyed and marked by suitable monuments, and find it to be about one thousand
            six hundred miles, independent of the lateral surveys that will be requisite, in order
            to determine the true line of boundary, should APPENDICES. 603 doubts on this point
            arise, on any portion of tlie line, in the minds of the Commissioners. The aggregate
            extent of survey necessary to fix the line, will scarcely fall short of two thousand or
            two thousand five hundred miles. Every one connected with this survey will then have as
            much as they can possibly attend to in performing the duties imme- diately connected
            with the boundary line, which should be completed at as early a period as possible.
            Besides these considerations of expediency, I cannot perceive how the expenses which
            would attend the accomplishment of Lieutenant Strain's project, could be legitimately
            drawn from the appropriations granted by Congress for the boundary survey. The Gulf of
            California lies far from the line of boundar}', and in territory belonging exclusively
            to Mexico, and not within the jurisdic- tion, therefore, of the United States, To
            attempt a minute survey of this gulf, under the pretence of its being an adjunct
            operation to the boundary surveys would undoubtedly arouse the suspicions of Mexico, and
            give oiFence to that Republic. It is true, that by the provisions of the late treaty our
            citizens have the riorht of inDfress and eess throuoh the Gulf of California : and it o
            o o o ? is not improbable, that if the proposition were made to the Mexican government
            through the proper channel, she might be disposed to enter * ft « into a joint
            arrangement with our government for an accurate hydro- graphic survey of the gulf; an
            undertaking that would be equally honorable to botli governments, and highly
            advantageous to the com- merce of both people. But in such an event, I should think it
            highly expedient that so important an operation should, on our side, be placed Under the
            direction of one of the organized corps of the government, maintained for such purposes,
            and provided with all the necessary appa- ratus and scientific experience which are
            necessary to success. I find by the latest maps we have of California, that the area of
            this gulf is not less tlian sixty-two thousand square miles. • To acomplish a survey of
            it in a manner to satisfy the requirements of commerce would, to say the least, occupy
            several years ; and it would probably cost very nearly as much as has been appropriated
            for the whole boundary survey, perhaps even more. If a mere reconnoissance of the gulf
            is proposed, I will remark that Mr. Gray, the United States Surveyor, informed me, on
            his arrival here, that General Persifer Smith had already detailed an ofiicer and
            supplied 604 APPENDICES a vessel for that object, I presume he tad proper authority for
            so doing. In regard to the "flotilla," which Lieut. Strain alUided to as being in
            command of, I must again most respectfully remark, that I consider this an injudicious
            arrangement, and that it ought to be dispensed with, I have been frequently engaged on
            surveys, for the last thirty years, of rivers, harboi'S, and portions of the sea coast,
            and always found the best persons to manage the boats employed on such service were the
            engi- neei and surveyors charged with, and responsible for, the execution of the duty.
            Landsmen born and reared near the sea coast, or near our great rivers, generally possess
            all the skill requisite for the manage- ment of such boats ; and I would much prefer on
            this boundary service the system, in tliis respect, which I have always heretofore
            practised? and tlierefore I recommend it to your favorable consideration. The letter of
            Lieut. Strain to the department, of October, 31, and the papers therein alluded to as
            accompanying the same, are herewith handed back to the department. " All which is
