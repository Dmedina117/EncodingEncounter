         <p> I HAVE observed that the most celebrated chroniclers before they begin to write their
            histories, first set forth a prologue and preface with the argument expressed in lofty
            rhetoric in order to give lustre and repute to their statements, so that the studious
            readers who peruse them may partake of their melody and flavour. But I, being no Latin
            scholar, dare not venture on such a preamble or prolc^ue, for in order properly to extol
            the adventures which we met with and the heroic deeds we accomplished during the
            Conquest of New Spain and its provinces in the company of that valiant and doughty
            Captain, Don Hernando Cortes (who later on, on account of his heroic deeds, was made
            Marques del Valle^) there would be needed an eloquence and rhetoric far beyond my
            powers. That which I have myself seen and the fighting I have gone through, with the
            help of God I will describe, quite simply, as a fair eye witness without twisting events
            one way or another. I am now an old man, over eighty- four years of age, and I have lost
            my sight and hearing, and, as luck would have it, I have gained nothing of value to
            leave to my children and descendants, but this my true * Created Marques del Valle de

            is. I will do no more now than give evidence of my nationality and birthplace, and note
            the year in which I set out from Castille and the names of the captains in whose company
            I went as a soldier, and state where I am now settled and have my home. BOOK I.-THE
            DISCOVERY. THE EXPEDITION UNDER FRANCISCO HERNANDEZ DE CORDOVA, CHAPTER I. The beginning
            of the story. BERNAL DIAZ DEL CASTILLO, citizen and Regidor of the most loyal city of
            Santiago de Guatemala, one of the first discoverers and conquerors of New Spain and its
            provinces, and the Cape of Honduras and all that lies within that land, a Native of the
            very noble and dis- tinguished town of Medina del Campo, and the son of its former
            Regidor^ Francisco Diaz del Castillo, who was also called " The graceful," (may his soul
            rest in glory), speak about that which concerns myself and all the true con- querors my
            companions who served His Majesty by discovering, conquering, pacifying and settling
            most of the provinces of New Spain, and that it is one of the best countries yet
            discpvered in the New World, we found out by our own efforts without His Majesty knowing
            anything about it 6 AN OUTLINE I also speak here in reply to all that has been said and
            written by persons who themselves knowing nothing, have received no true account from
            others of what really took place, but who nevertheless now put forward any state- ments
            that happen to suit their fancy. As there is no account of our many and remarkable
            services such as their merits deserve ******** these indifferent story-tellers are now
            unwilling that we should receive the recompense and * * Â» * * which His Majesty has
            ordered his Governors and Viceroys to afford us. Apart from these reasons such deeds as
            those I am going on to describe, cannot be forgotten, and the truth about them will be
            proved afresh, but, as in the books which have been written on the subject the truth has
            so often been perverted, [I write this history] so that when tales are told of daring
            deeds our fame shall not suffer, and that on account of such brilliant adventures our
            names may be placed among the most famous, for we have run the risk of death and wounds,
            and have suffered a thousand other miseries, venturing our lives in dis- covering lands
            about which nothing whatever was known, battling by day and by night with a host of
            doughty warriors, at so great a distance from Castille that no aid or assistance could
            reach us, save the only true help, namely the loving kindness of our Lord God whom it
            has pleased that we should conquer New Spain and the far- famed city of Tenochtitlan/
            Mexico, for so it is called, and many other cities and provinces which are too numerous
            for me to name. As soon as we had the country pacified and settled by Spaniards, we
            thought it to be our duty as good and loyal subjects of His Majesty, with much respect
            for our King and natural Lord, to hand the country over to him. With that ^ Tenuztitlan
            in the original. or THE STORY. 7 intent we sent our Ambassadors to Castille and thence
            to Flanders where his Majesty at that time held his Court. I shall also tell about all
            the good results that came of it, and about the large number of souls which have been
            saved, and are daily being saved, by conversion to the faith, all of which souls were
            formerly lost in Hell. In addition to this holy work, attention will be called to the
            great treasure which we sent as a present to his Majesty, and that which has been sent
            and is being sent daily and is in the form of the Royal Fifths,* as well as in the large
            amounts carried off by many persons of all classes. I shall tell in this story who was
            the first discoverer of the province of Yucatan, and how we went to the discovery of New
            Spain and who were the Captains and soldiers who conquered and settled it and many other
            things which happened during the conquest, which are worth knowing and should not be
            forgotten ; all this I shall relate as briefly as possible, and above all with the
            assured truth of an eye witness. *If I were to remember and recount one by one the
            heroic [deeds] which we, one and all of us valiant captains and brave [soldiers]
            accomplished, from the beginning to the end of the conquest, reciting each deed as it
            deserved, it would, indeed, be a great [undertaking,] and would need a very famous
            historian [to carry it out] with greater eloquence and style than my poor words [can
            compass.] As later on Â« * Â« * when I was present and saw and understood, and I will call
            to mind * * * * that repeats m m m imposed as a duty â and delicate style and I * * Â« Â«

            understand [only] the battles and pacifications where I was myself present, for I was
            one of the first [to set out] from Cuba in the company of a Captain named Francisco
            [Hernandez de Cordova] and we were accompanied on that voyage by one hundred and ten
            soldiers, we explored * * * â¦ they stopped (?) at the first place at which one landed
            which is called Cape [Catoche and at] a town further on called Chanpoton more than half
            of us [were killed and] the Captain received ten arrow wounds and all the rest of us
            soldiers got two [arrow wounds and the Indians] a[ttack]ing us with such skill we were
            obliged,, with the greatest difficulty to return to the Island [of Cuba whence] we had
            set out with the fleet, and the captain died almost as soon as we landed, and of the one
            hundred and ten soldiers who set out with us, fifty- seven were left behind, dead. After
            this first warlike expedition, I set out a second time from this same Island of Cuba
            under another captain, named Juan de Grijalva, and we again had great warlike encounters
            with these same Indians of the Pueblo of Chanpoton, and in this second battle many of
            our soldiers were killed. From that Pueblo we went on along the coast, exploring, until
            we arrived at New Spain and then kept on our way until we reached the province of
            Panuco. Then a second time we had to turn back to the Island of Cuba, baffled and
            exhausted both from hunger and thirst, and from other reasons which I will set forth in
            the chapter which treats of this expedition. OF THE StORY. 9 To go back to my story ; I
            set out for the third time with the daring and valiant captain Don Hernando Cortes, who
            later on was made Marques del Valle and received other titles of honour. I repeat that
            no other captain or soldier went to New Spain three times in succession on one
            expedition after another as I did, so that I am the earliest discoverer and conqueror
            who has ever lived or is now living in New Spain. Although many soldiers went twice on
            voyages of discovery, the first time with Juan de Grijalva whom I have already
            mentioned, and the second time with the gallant captain Cortes, yet they never went
            three times in succession. If they went the first time with Francisco Hernandez de
            Cordova, they did not go the second time with Grijalva, nor the third time with the
            valiant Cortes. God has been pleased to preserve me through many risks of death, both
            during this laborious discovery, and in the very bloody Mexican wars (and I give God
            many thanks for it), in order that I may tell and declare the events that happened in
            those wars, so that studious readers may give them attention and thought. I was
            twenty-four years old when Diego Velasquez, the Governor of the Island of Cuba, who was
            my kinsman, promised to give me some Indians as soon as there were any available, but I
            did not care to be kept waiting until this should happen. I always had a zeal for
            soldiering, as â¢ it is becoming that a man should have, both in order to serve God and
            the king and to endeavour to gain renown, and as being such a life that honourable men
            should seek, and I gradually put from my mind the death of my companions who were killed
            in those times and the wounds that I myself received, and the fatigue and hardship I
            endured and which all must endure who set out to discover new lands, and, being as we
            were, but a small company, dare to enter into great towns swarming with hostile
            warriors. I myself was always at the front and never Â» V -. 10 THE AUTHOR SAILS FOR

            clearly seen in the course of this story. In the year fifteen hundred and fourteen, I
            came from Castille and began my career as a soldier on Tierra-firme,^ then went on to
            the discovery of Yucatan and New Spain, and as my forefathers, my father and my brother
            had always been servants of the crown and of the Catholic kings of glorious memory Don
            Fernando and Dofia Ysabel, I wished to be something like them. In the year 15 14, as I
            have already said, there came out as Governor of Tierra-firme, a gentleman named
            PedrÃ¡rias DÃ¡vila.* I agreed to go with him to his Government and the country conquered
            by him. So as to shorten the story, I will not relate what happened on the voyage, more
            than to say sometimes with good weather and other times with bad weather, we arrived at
            N ombre de Dios, for so it was named. Some three or four months after the settlement was
            formed, there came a pestilence from which many soldiers died, and in addition to this,
            all the rest of us fell ill and suffered from bad ulcers on the legs. Then disputes
            arose between the Governor and a nobleman named Vasco Nuflez de Balboa, the captain, who
            had conquered that province, to whom PedrÃ¡rias DÃ¡vila had given his daughter (Dofia
            somebody Arias de Pefialosa) in marriage. But it seems that after marriage, he grew
            suspicious of his son-in- law, believing that he would rise in rebellion and lead a body
            of soldiers towards the South Sea, so he gave orders that Balboa should have his throat
            cut and certain of the soldiers should be punished. As we were witnesses of what I have
            related, and of other revolts among the captains, and as the news reached * Tierra-firme
            = the Spanish Main. ' Pedro Arias de Ãvila. LEAVES TIERRA-FIRME FOR CUBA. It US that the
            Island of Cuba had lately been conquered and settled, and that a gentleman named Diego
            Velasquez, a native of Cuellar, who has already been mentioned by me, had been made
            Governor of the Island, some of us gentle- men and persons of quality, who had come out
            with PedrÃ¡rias DÃ¡vila, made up our minds to ask him to give us permission to go to Cuba,
            and he willingly did so, as he had no need of all the soldiers he had brought with him
            from Castille, as there was no one left to conquer. Indeed the country under his rule is
            small and thinly peopled, and his son-in-law Vasco Nunez de Balboa had already conquered
            it and ensured peace. As soon as leave was granted we embarked in a good ship and with
            fair weather reached the Island of Cuba. .On landing we went at once to pay our respects
            to the Governor, who was pleased at our coming, and promised to give us Indians as soon
            as there were any to spare. When three years had gone by, counting both the time we were
            in Tierra-iirme and that which we had passed in the Island of Cuba, and it became
            evident that we were merely wasting our time, one hundred and ten of us got together,
            most of us comrades who had come from Tierra- iirme, and the other Spaniards of Cuba who
            had had no Indians assigned to them, and we made an agreement with a gentleman named
            Francisco Hernandez de Cordova,^ whose name I have already mentioned, a rich man who
            owned an Indian Pueblo in the Island, that he should be our leader, for he was well
            fitted for the post, and that we should try our fortune in seeking and exploring new
            lands where we might find employment With this object in view, we purchased three ships,
            two ^ The three partners in this expedition were Francisco Hernandez de Cordova, Lope
            Ochoa de Caicedo and CristÃ³val Morante. (See letter from the Municipality of Vera Cruz,
            dated loth July, 15 19. Usually known as Cortes' first letter.) 12 PREPARATIONS FOR AN
            EXPEDITION of them of good capacity, and the third, a bark, bought on credit from the
            Governor, Diego Velasquez, on the con- dition that all of us soldiers should go in the
            three vessels to some islands lying between Cuba and Honduras, which are now called the
            Islands of the Guanajes,^ and make war on the natives and load the vessels with Indians,
            as slaves, with which to pay him for his bark. However, as we soldiers knew that what
            Diego Velasquez asked of us was not just, we answered that it was neither in accordancel
            with the law of God nor of the king, that we should make^ free men slaves. When he saw
            that we had made up/ our minds, he said that our plan to go and discover new countries
            was better than his, and he helped us in providing food for our voyage. Certain
            inquisitive gentlemen have asked me why I have written down these words which Diego
            Velasquez uttered about selling us the ship, and they say they have an ugly look and
            should not have been inserted in this history. I reply that I write them here because it
            is desirable on account of the law suits which Diego Velasquez and the Bishop of Burgos
            and Arch- bishop of Rosano, whose name is Juan Rodriguez de Fonscca, brought against us.
            To return to my story, we now found ourselves with three ships stored with Cassava*
            bread, which is made from a root, and we bought some pigs which cost three dollars
            apiece, for in those days there were neither sheep nor cattle in the Island of Cuba, for
            it was only beginning to be settled, and we added a supply of oil, and bought beads and
            other things of small value to be used for barter. We then sought out three pilots, of
            whom the chief, who took charge of the fleet, was called Anton de Alaminos a native of
            Palos, the second came from Triana ^ Roatan, Bonacca, etc. Islands near the coast of
            Honduras. ' Cassava bread. Made from the root of Manihoc utilissima. UNDER FRANCISCO

            Manquillo "* from Huelva. We also engaged the necessary number of sailors and procured
            the best supply that we could afford of ropes, cordage, cables, and anchors, and casks
            for water and other things needed for the voyage, and this all to our own cost and
            regret. When all the soldiers were mustered, we set out for a port which in the Indian
            language is called Axaruco,* on the North coast, eight leagues from a town named San
            Cristobal, which was then inhabited and which two years later was moved to the present
            site of Havana. In order that our voyage should proceed on right principles we wished to
            take with us a priest named Alonso Gonzalez who was then living in the said town of San
            Cristobal, and he agreed to come with us. We also chose for the office of Veedor} (in
            his Majesty's name), a soldier named Bemaldino Yftiguez, a native of Santo Domingo de la
            Calzada, so that if God willed that we should come on rich lands, or people who
            possessed gold or silver or pearls or any other kind of treasure, there should be a
            responsible person to guard the Royal Fifth. After all was arranged and we had heard

            II. How we discovered the Province of Yucatan. On the eighth day of the month of
            February in the year fifteen hundred and seventeen, we left the Havana from the port of
            Axaruco, which is on the North coast, and in twelve days we doubled Cape San Antonio,
            which is also called in the Island of Cuba the land of the Guanaha- taveyes, who are
            Indians like savages. When we had passed this Cape we were in the open sea and trusting
            to luck we steered towards the setting sun, knowing nothing of the depth of water, nor
            of the currents, nor of the winds which usually prevail in that latitude, so we ran
            great risk of our lives, then a storm struck us which lasted two days and two nights,
            and raged with such streng^ that we were nearly lost. When the weather moderated, we
            kept on our course, and twenty-one days after leaving port, we sighted land, at which we
            rejoiced greatly and gave thanks to God. This land had never been discovered before and
            no report of it had reached us. From the ships we could see a large town standing back
            about two leagues from the coast, and as we had never seen such a large town in the
            Island of Cuba nor in Hispaniola, we named it the Great Cairo. We arranged that the two
            vessels which drew the least water should go in as near as possible to the Coast, to
            examine the land and see if there was an anchorage near the shore. On the morning of the
            4th March, we saw ten large canoes, called piraguas^ full of Indians from the town,
            approaching us with oars and sails. The canoes were large ones made like hollow troughs
            cleverly cut out from huge single logs, and many of them would hold forty Indians. To go
            back to my story ; the Indians in the ten canoes CAPE CATOCHE. 15 came close to our
            ships, and we made signs of peace to them, beckoning with our hands and waving our
            cloaks to induce them to come and speak to us, although at that time we had no
            interpreters who could speak the lan- guages of Yucatan and Mexico. They approached
            quite fearlessly and more than thirty of them came on board the flagship, and we gave
            them each a present of a string of green beads, and they passed some time examining the
            ships. The chief man among them, who was a Cacique, made signs to us that they wished
            ,to embark in their canoes and return to their town, and that they would come back again
            another day with more canoes in which we could go ashore. These Indians were clothed in
            cotton shirts made like jackets, and covered their persons with a narrow cloth which
            they call masteles, and they seemed to us a people superior to the Cubans, for the Cuban
            Indians go about naked, only the women wearing a cloth reaching to the thighs, which
            cloths they call naguas} To return to my story; the next morning the same Cacique
            returned to Ihe ships and brought twelve large canoes, which I have already said are
            czWed piraguas^ with Indian rowers, and with a cheerful face and every appear- ance of
            friendliness, made signs that we should go to his town, where they would feed us and
            supply all our needs, and that in those canoes of his we could land. He kept on saying
            in his language, ''cones catoâ¬hÃ©\ ^ cones catoâ¬he*\ which means "come to my houses", and
            for that reason we. called the land Cape Catoche, and it is still so named on the
            charts. When our captain and the soldiers saw the friendly ^ Why the author should have
            written " que llaman naguas " is not dear. Ãnaguas or naguas is the Spanish, not the
            Cuban, word for the skirt, petticoat or upper skirt of a woman's dress. 1 6 ATTACKED BY
            NATIVES. overtures the chief was making to us, we agreed to lower the boats from our
            ships, and in the vessel of least draught, and in the twelve canoes, to go ashore all
            together, and because we saw that the shore was crowded with Indians from the town, we
            arranged to land all of us at the same moment. When the Cacique saw us all on shore, but
            showing no intention of going to his town, he again made signs to our captain that we
            should go with him to his houses, and he showed such evidence of peace and good-will,
            that our captain asked our advice whether we should go on or no, and most of the
            soldiers were of opinion that with the precaution of taking all our arms with us we
            should go on, and we took with us fifteen crossbows and ten muskets, so with the Cacique
            as our guide, we began our march along the road, accompanied by many Indians. We moved
            on in this way until we approached some brush-covered hillocks, when the Cacique began
            to shout and call out to some squadrons of warriors who were lying in ambush ready to
            fall upon us and kill us. On hearing the Cacique's shouts, the warriors attacked us in
            great haste and fury, and began to shoot with such skill that the first flight of arrows
            wounded fifteen soldiers. These warriors wore armour made of cotton reaching to the
            knees and carried lances and shields, bows and arrows, slings and many stones. After the
            flight of arrows, the warriors, with their feathered crests waving, attacked us hand to
            hand, and hurling their lances with all their might they did us much damage. However,
            thank God, we soon put them to flight when they felt the sharp edge of our swords, and
            the effect of our guns and crossbows, and fifteen of them fell dead. A short distance
            ahead of the place where they attacked us, was a small plaza with three houses built of
            masonry, INDIAN PRISONERS. I/ which served as Cues^ and oratories.* These houses con-
            tained many pottery Idols, some with the faces of demons and others with women's faces,
            and there were others of evil figures of Indians who appeared to be committing sodomy
            one with another. Within the houses were some small wooden chests, and in them were some
            other Idols, and some little discs made partly of gold but more than half of copper, and
            some necklaces and three diadems, and other small objects in the form of fish and others
            like the ducks of the country, all made of inferior gold. When we had seen the gold and
            the houses of masonry, ^^ i we felt well content at having discovered such a country,
            for at that time Peru was unknown, indeed, it was not discovered until twenty years
            later. While we were fighting with the Indians, the priest Gonzalez had accompanied us,
            and he took charge of the chests and the gold, and the Idols, and carried them to the
            ship. In these skirmishes we took two Indians prisoners, and later on, when they were
            baptized, one was named Julian and the other Melchior, both of them were cross-eyed.
            When the fight was over we returned to our ships, and went on exploring along the coast
            towards the setting sun, we set sail as soon as the wounded were cared for, and what
            else happened I will tell later on. ^ Cue is the name commonly applied to the Indian
            shrines or Itemples, usually small buildings raised on pyramidal foundations. It IS not
            a Maya or Mexican word, but one picked up by the Spaniards |n the Antilles. â¢ It should
            be noted that, although the Spaniards had now been in America for twenty-four years and
            had explored the Islands and the coast of the mainland from the mouth of the Orinoco to
            the Bay of Honduras, and part of the coast of Florida, this was the first time they had
            seen houses and temples built of stone ; and with the exception of the crew of a canoe
            which Columbus met during his fourth voyage near the Islands of the Guanajes off the
            coast of Hon- duras, this was the first meeting of the Spaniards with any of the more
            civilised races of America. 1 8 SPANIARDS LAND AT CAMPECHE. CHAPTER III. How we coasted
            along towards the west, discovering capes and deep water, roadsteads and reefs.
            Believing this land to be an Island, as the Pilot, Anton de A [aminos, had assured us
            that it was, we travelled with the greatest caution, sailing only by day and anchoring
            by night. After voyaging in this manner for fifteen days, we descried from the ship,
            what appeared to be a large town near to a great bay or creek, and we thought that there
            might be a river or stream there, where we could pro- vide ourselves with water of which
            we had great need, because the casks and other vessels which we had brought with us,
            were not watertight. It was because our fleet was manned by poor men who had not money
            enough to purchase good casks and cables, that the water ran short. We had to land near
            the town, and as it was Sunday, the day of San LÃ¡zaro, we gave the town that name, and
            so it is marked on the charts, but its proper Indian name is Campeche. In order that we
            could all of us land at the same time, we agreed to approach the shore in the smallest
            of the vessels, and in the three boats, with all our arms ready, so as not to be caught
            as we had been at Cape Catoche. In these roadsteads and bays, the water shallows very
            considerably at low tide, so that we had to leave our ships anchored more than a league
            from the shore. We went ashore near the town where there was a pool of good water, used
            by the people of the place for drinking water, for as far as we had seen there were no
            rivers in this country. We landed the casks, intending to fill them with water, and
            return to our ships. When the casks were full, and we were ready to embark, a company of
            about fifty Indians, clad in good cotton mantles, came out in a peace- STONE-BUILT
            TEMPLES. I9 ful manner from the town. From their appearance we believed them to be
            Caciques, and they asked us by signs what it was we were looking for, and we gave them
            to understand that we had come for water, and wished to return at once to our ships.
            They then made signs with their hands to find out whether we came from the direction of
            the sunrise, repeating the word " Castilan " " Castilan " and we did not understand what
            they meant by Castilan, They then asked us by signs to go with them to their town, and
            we took council together as to what we should do, and decided to go with them, keeping
            well on the alert and in good formation. They led us to some large houses very well
            built of masonry, which were the Temples of their Idols, and on the walls were figured
            the bodies of many great serpents and snakes and other pictures of evil-looking Idols.
            These walls surrounded a sort of Altar covered with clotted blood. On the other side of
            the Idols were symbols like crosses, and all were coloured. At all this we stood
            wondering, as they were things never seen or heard of before. It seemed as though
            certain Indians had just offered sacrifices to their Idols so as to ensure victory over
            us. However, many Indian women moved about us, laughing, and with every appearance of
            good will, but the Indians gathered in such numbers that we began to fear that there
            might be some trap set for us as at Catoche. While this was happening, many other
            Indians approached us, wearing very ragged mantles and carrying dry reeds, which they
            deposited upon the plain, and behind them came two squadrons of Indian archers in cotton
            armour, carrying lances and shields, slings and stones, and each captain drew up his
            squadron at a short distance from where we stood. At that moment, there sallied from
            another house, which was an oratory of their Idols, ten C 2 20 THE RETURN TO THE SHIPS.
            Indians clad in long white cotton cloaks, reaching to their feet, and with their long
            hair reeking with blood, and so matted together, that it could never be parted or even
            combed out again, unless it were cut. These were the priests of the Idols, who in New
            Spain are commonly cMed Ã½aÃ½as and such I shall call them hereafter. These priests
            brought us incense of a sort of resin which they call cofia/, and with pottery braziers
            full of live coals, they began to fumigate us, and by signs they made us under- stand
            that we should quit their land before the firewood which they had piled up there should
            burn out, otherwise they would attack us and kill us. After ordering fire to be put to
            the reeds, the priests withdrew without further speech. Then the warriors who were drawn
            up in battle array began to whistle and sound their trumpets and drums. When we
            perceived their menacing appearance and saw great squadrons of Indians bearing down on
            us we remembered that we had not yet recovered from the wounds received at Cape Catoche,
            and had been obliged to throw overboard the bodies of two soldiers who had died, and
            fear fell on us, so we determined to retreat to the coast in good order, and began to
            march along the shore towards a large rock which rose out of the sea, while the boats
            and the small bark laden with the water casks coasted along close in shore. We had not
            dared to embark near the town where we had landed, on account of the great press of
            Indians, for we felt sure they would attack us as we tried to get in the boats. As soon
            as we had embarked and got the casks on board the ships, we sailed on for six days and
            nights in good weather, then we were struck by a norther which is a foul wind on that
            coast and it lasted four days and nights, and so strong was the storm that it nearly
            drove us ashore, so that we had to drop anchor, but we broke two cables, and one ship
            began to drag her anchor. Ah ! the danger was terrible, for if SPANIARDS LAND AT
            CHANPOTON. 2Ã our last cable had given way we should have been driven ashore to
            destruction, but thank God we were able to ease the strain on the cable by lashing it
            with pieces of rope and hawsers, and at last the weather moderated. Then we kept on our
            course along the coast, going ashore whenever we were able to do so to get water, for,
            as I have already said, the casks we carried were not only leaky, but were gaping open,
            and we could not depend upon them, and we hoped that by keeping near the coast we should
            be able to find water, whenever we landed, either in pools or by digging for it. As we
            were sailing along on our course, we came in sight of a town, and about a league on the
            near side of it, there was a bay which looked as though it had a river or stream running
            into it ; so we determined to anchor. On this coast the tide runs out so far that there
            is danger of the ships being stranded, so for fear of this we dropped anchor at the
            distance of a league from the shore, and we landed in that bay from the vessel of least
            draught and from the boats, carrying all our casks along with us to fill them with
            water. We landed soon after mid-day, well armed with crossbows and guns. This landing
            place was about a league from the town, near to some pools of water, and maize
            plantations, and a few small houses built of masonry. The town is called Potonchan.^ ^
            This town is called both Potonchan and Chanpoton by Bernal Diaz, and Chanpoton in the "
            Itinirario" and in the Letter from the Municipality of Vera Cruz to Chas. V. In modem
            maps it is called Champoton. There is a further difficulty about the name of this town,
            because the town at the mouth of the Rio de Grijalva (Sta. Maria de la Victoria) was
            also called Potonchon or Potonchan. In the "Relacion de la Villa de Santa Maria de la
            Victoria" (i 579), printed in the Documentos Ineditos, Relaciones de Yucatan (Madrid,
            1898) we find : " This province is called the province of Tabasco, because the Lord of
            this town was called Tabasco, and the name of the town is Potonchan, which in Spanish
            means the Chontal tongue, almost as though we should say the barbarous tongue, for
            Chontal in the Mexican language is the same as barbarous, and so this town is called
            Poton- chan, as that is the language generally used in this province ; and as Ã¡2 INDIAN
            WARRIORS ASSEMBLE. We filled our casks with water, but we could not carry them away on
            account of the great number of warriors who fell on us. I will stop now and tell later
            on about the attack they made on us. CHAPTER IV. Concerning the attack made on us as we
            stood among the farms and maize fields already mentioned. As we were filling our casks
            with water there came along the coast towards us from the town of Potonchan^ (as it is
            called) many squadrons of Indians clad in cotton armour reaching to the knees, and armed
            with bows and arrows, lances and shields, and swords like two handed broad swords, and
            slings and stones and carrying the feathered crests which they are accustomed to wear.
            Their faces were painted black and white, and ruddled and they came in silence straight
            towards us, as though they came in peace, and by signs they asked whether we came from
            where the sun rose, and we replied that we did come from the direction of the sunrise.
            We were at our wits end considering the matter and wondering what the words were which
            the Indians called out to us for they were the same as those used by the people of
            LÃ¡zaro, but we never made out what it was that they said. the Lord of this town was
            called Tabasco the province is called Tabasco." Santa Maria de la Victoria appears to
            have lost both its original native and its Spanish name, and soon became known as the
            town of Tabasco, and is so marked on the map of Melchor de Santa Cruz (1579) ; not long
            afterwards the town itself disappeared. Chanpoton has retained its name, and when Bernal
            Diaz mentions Chanpoton or Potonchan he invariably intends to indicate the site of the
            modem Champoton, between Campeche and the Laguna de TÃ©rminos, the "Costa de Mala Pelea"
            of the expedition under Francisco Hernandez de Cordova. * Here written Pontuchan in the

            about the time of the Ave Maria, and the Indians then went ofif to some villages in the
            neighbourhood, and we posted watchmen and sentinels for security, for we did not like
            such a large gathering of Indians. While we were keeping watch during the night we heard
            a great squadron of Indian warriors approaching from the town and from the farms, and we
            knew well that their assembly boded us no good, and we took council together as to what
            should be done. Some of the soldiers were of opinion that we should embark without delay
            ; however as always happens in such cases, some said one thing and some said another,
            but the Indians being in such numbers it seemed to most of my companions that if we made
            any attempt to embark they would be sure to attack us, and we should run great risk of
            losing our lives. Some others were of opinion that we should fall upon the Indians that
            very night, for, as the proverb says " who attacks conquers ". On the other hand we
            could see that there were about two hundred Indians to every one of us. While we were
            still taking council the dawn broke, and we said one to the other " let us strengthen
            our hearts for the fight, and after commend- ing ourselves to God let us do our best to
            save our lives." As soon as it was daylight we could see, coming along the coast, many
            more Indian warriors with their banners raised, and with feathered crests and drums, and
            they joined those warriors who had assembled the night before. When their squadrons were
            formed up they surrounded us on all sides and poured in such showers of arrows and
            darts, and stones thrown from their slings that over eighty of us soldiers were wounded,
            and they attacked us hand to hand, some with lances and the others shooting arrows, and
            others with two-handed Ã¡4 DEFEAT OF THE SPANIARDS. knife edged swords,^ and they brought
            us to a bad pass. We gave them a good return of thrusts and cuts and the guns and
            crossbows never ceased their work, some being loaded while the others were fired. At
            last feeling the effects of our sword. play they drew back a little, but it was not far,
            and only enabled them to shoot their stones and darts at us with greater safety to them-
            selves. While the battle was raging the Indians called to one another in their language
            "a/ Calachuni^ CalachunV^ which means " let us attack the Captain and kill him," and ten
            times they wounded him with their arrows ; and me they struck thrice, one arrow wounding
            me dangerously in the left side, piercing through the ribs. All the other soldiers were
            wounded by spear thrusts and two of them were carried off alive, one named Alonzo Boto,
            and the other an old Portuguese man. Our captain then saw that our good fighting availed
            us nothing ; other squadrons of warriors were approaching us fresh from the town,
            bringing food and drink with them and a large supply of arrows. All our soldiers were
            wounded with two or three arrow wounds, three of them had their throats pierced by lance
            thrusts, our captain was bleeding from many wounds and already fifty of the soldiers
            were lying dead. Feeling that our strength was exhausted we determined with stout hearts
            to break through the battalions sur- rounding us and seek shelter in the boats which
            awaited us near the shore, and proved to be a great assistance to us ; so we formed in
            close array and broke through the enemy. Ah ! then to hear the yells, hisses and cries,

            might, wounding us sorely. Then another danger befell us ; as we all sought shelter in
            the boats at the same time and there were so many of us they began to sink, so in the
            best way we could manage hanging on to the waterlogged boats and half swimming, we
            reached the vessel of lightest draught which came in all haste to our assistance. Many
            of us were wounded while we embarked, especially those who were sitting in the stern of
            the boats, for the Indians shot at them as targets, and even waded into the sea with
            their lances and attacked us with all their strength. Thank God ! by a great effort we
            escaped with our lives from the clutches of those people. When we got on board the ships
            we found that over fifty of our soldiers were missing, among them two who had been
            carried off alive. Within a few days we had to cast into the sea five others who died of
            their wounds and of the great thirst which we suffered. The whole of the fighting
            occupied only one hour. The place is called Potonchan,^ but the pilots and sailors have
            marked it on the chart as the "Costa de Mala Pelea" (the coast of the disastrous
            battle). When we were safely out of that affray we gave hearty thanks to God. As the
            wounds of the soldiers were being dressed, some of them complained of the pain they
            felt, for they began to be chilled and the salt water caused considerable swelling, and
            some of them began to curse the pilot Anton de Alaminos and his voyage and discovery of
            the Island, for he always maintained that it was an Island and not the main land. Here I
            must leave off and I will tell what happened to us later on. ^ Chanpotoii. 26 THE RETURN
            VOYAGE. CHAPTER V. How we agreed to return to the Island of Cuba and of the great
            hardships we endured before arriving at the Port of Havana. As soon as we got on board
            ship again, in the way I have related, we gave thanks to God, and after we had attended
            to the wounded (and there was not a man among us who had not two, three or four wounds,
            and the Captain was wounded in ten places and only one soldier escaped without hurt) we
            decided to return to Cuba. As almost all the sailors also were wounded we were
            shorthanded for tending the sails, so we abandoned the smallest vessel and set fire to
            her after removing the sails, cables and anchors, and we divided the sailors who were
            unwounded between the two larger vessels. However, our greatest trouble arose from the
            want of fresh water, for owing to the attack made on us at Chanpoton, and the haste with
            which we had to take to the boats, we could not carry away with us the casks and barrels
            which we had filled with water, and they were all left behind. So great was our thirst
            that our mouths and tongues were cracked with the dryness, and there was nothing to give
            us relief. Oh ! what hardshipÃ¡ one endures, when discovering new lands, in the way we
            set out to do it ; no one can appreciate the excessive hardships who has not passed
            through them as we did. We kept our course close to the land in hope of finding some
            stream or bay where we could get fresh water, and at the end of three days we found a
            bay where there ~ appeared to be a river or creek which we thought might hold fresh
            water. Fifteen of the sailors who had remained on board and were unwounded and three
            soldiers who were out of danger from their wounds went ashore, and ALAMINOS STEERS FOR
            FLORIDA. 27 they took hoes with them, and some barrels to fill with water ; but the
            water of the creek was salt, so they dug holes on the beach, but there also the water
            was as salt and bitter as that in the creek. However, bad as the water was, they filled
            the casks with it and brought it on board, but no one could drink such water and it did
            harm to the mouths and bodies of the few soldiers who attempted to drink it. There were
            so many large alligators in that creek that it has always been known as the estero de
            los Lagartos and so it is marked on the charts. While the boats went ashore for water
            there arose such a violent gale from the North East that the ships began to drag their
            anchors and drift towards the shore, for on that coast contrary winds prevail from the
            North or North East. When the sailors who had gone on shore saw what the weather was
            like they returned with the boats in hot haste and arrived in time to put out other
            anchors and cables, so that the ships rode in safety for two days and nigh*ts. Then we
            got up anchor and set sail continuing our voyage back to the island of Cuba. The pilot
            Alaminos then took council with the other two pilots, and it was settled that from the
            place we then were we should cross over to Florida, for he judged from his charts and
            observations that it was about seventy leagues distant, and that having arrived in
            Florida they said that it would be an easier voyage and shorter course to reach Havana
            than the course by which we had come. We did as the pilot advise.d, for it seems that he
            had accompanied Juan Ponce de Leon on his voyage of discovery to Florida fourteen or
            fifteen years earlier,^ when in that same land Juan Ponce was defeated and * Juan Ponce
            de Leon discovered Florida on Easter Sunday (Pascua Florida), 27th March, 15 13. 28 THE
            SPANIARDS LAND IN FLORIDA. killed. After four days' sail we came in sight of the land of
            Florida, and what happened to us there I will tell next. CHAPTER VI. How twenty- of us
            soldiers went ashore in the Bay of Florida, in company with the Pilot Alaminos, to look
            for water, and the attack that the natives of the land made on us, and what else
            happened before we returned to Havana. When we reached Florida it was arranged that
            twenty of the soldiers, those whose wounds were best healed, should go ashore. I went
            with them, and also the Pilot, Anton de Alaminos, and we carried with us such vessels >
            as we still possessed, and hoes, and our crossbows and guns. As the Captain was very
            badly wounded, and much weakened by the great thirst he had endured, he prayed us on no
            account to fail in bringing back fresh water as he was parching and dying of thirst,
            for, as I have already said, the water we had on board was salt and not fit to drink. We
            landed near a creek which opened towards the sea, and the Pilot Alaminos carefully
            examined the coast and said that ,he had been at this very spot when he came on a voyage
            of discovery with Juan Ponce de Leon and that the Indians of the country had attacked
            them and had killed many soldiers, and that it behoved us to keep a very sharp look out.
            We at once posted two soldiers as sentinels while we dug deep holes on a broad beach
            where we thought we should find fresh water, for at that hour the tide had ebbed. It
            pleased God that we should come on very good water, and so overjoyed were we that what
            with satiating our thirst, and washing out cloths with which to bind up wounds, we must
            have stayed there an hour. When, at last, very well satisfied, we wished to go SKIRMISH
            WITH THE NATIVES. 29 on board with the water, we saw one of the soldiers whom we had
            placed on guard coming towards us crying out, " to arms, to arms ! many Indian warriors
            are coming on foot and others down the creek in canoes." The soldier who came shouting,
            and the Indians reached us nearly at the same time. These Indians carried very long bows
            and good arrows and lances, and some weapons like swords, and they were clad in
            deerskins and were very big men. They came straight on and let fly their arrows and at
            once wounded six of us, and to me they dealt a slight arrow wound. However, we fell on
            them with such rapidity of cut and thrust of sword and so plied the crossbows and guns
            that they left us to ourselves and set off" to the sea and the creek to help their
            companions who had come in the canoes and were fighting hand to hand with the sailors,
            whose boat was already captured and was being towed by the canoes up the creek, four of
            the sailors being wounded, and the Pilot Alaminos badly hurt in the throat. Then we fell
            upon them, with the water above our waists, and at the point of the sword, we made them
            abandon the boat. Twenty of the Indians lay dead on the shore or in the water, and three
            who were slightly wounded we took prisoners, but they died on board ship. As soon as the
            skirmish was over we asked the soldier who had been placed on guard what had become of
            his companion Berrio (for so he was named). He replied that he had seen him go off with
            an axe in his hand to cut down a small palm tree, and that he went towards the creek,
            whence the Indian warriors had approached us, that he then heard cries in Spanish, and
            on that account he had hurried towards us to give us warning, and it was then that his
            companion must have been killed. 30 SET SAIL FOR HAVANA. The soldier who had disappeared
            was the only man who had escaped unwounded from the fight at Poton- chan^ and it was his
            fate to come on here to die. We at once set to work to search for our soldier along the
            trail made by the Indians who had attacked us. We found a palm tree partly cut through,
            and near by the ground was much trampled by footsteps more than in other parts, and as
            there was no trace of blood we took it for certain that they had carried him off alive.
            We searched and shouted all round about for more than an hour, but finding no trace of
            him we got into the boats and carried the fresh water to the ship, at which the soldiers
            were as overjoyed as though we had given them their lives. One soldier jumped from the
            ship into the boat, so great was his thirst, and clasping a jar of water to his chest
            drank so much water that he swelled up and died within two days. As soon as we had got
            the water on board and had hauled up the boats, we set sail for Havana, and during the
            next day and night the weather was fair and we were near some Islands called Los
            Martires among the shoals called the shoals of the Martyrs. Our deepest soundings gave
            four fathoms, and the flagship struck the ground when going between the Islands and made
            water fast, and with all of us soldiers working at the pumps we were not able to check
            it, and we were in fear of foundering. We had some Levantine sailors on board with us,
            and we called to them, " Comrades, come and help to work the pump, for you can see that
            we are all badly wounded and weary from working day and night." And the Levantines
            answered, " Do it yourselves, for we do not get any pay as you do, but only hunger and
            thirst, toil and wounds." So then we made them help us with the work. ^ Chanpoton. DEATH
            OF FRANCISCO HERNANDEZ DE CORDOVA. 3 1 111 and wounded as we were we managed to trim the
            sails and work the pump until our Lord carried us into the Port of Carenas/ where now
            stands the city of Havana, but it used to be called Puerto de Carenas, and when we got
            to land we gave thanks to God. I must remember to say that when we got to Havana, a
            Portuguese diver who happened to be in that port soon got the water out of the flagship.
            We wrote in great haste to the Governor of the Island, Diego Velasquez, telling him that
            we had discovered thickly - peopled countries, with masonry houses, and people who
            covered their persons and went about clothed in cotton garments, and who possessed gold
            and who cultivated maize fields, and other matters which I have forgotten. From Havana
            our Captain Francisco Hernandez went by land to the town of Santispiritus, for so it is
            called, of which he was a citizen, and where he had his Indians ; but he was so badly
            wounded that he died within ten days. Three soldiers died of their wounds in Havana, and
            all the rest of us dispersed and went some to one and some to other parts of the Island.
            The ships went on to Santiago where the Governor was living, and the two Indians whom we
            captured at Cape Catoche, whom we named Melchorejo and Julianillo were sent on shore, as
            were also the little chest with the diadems and the ducks and little fish and other
            articles of gold and the many idols. These showed such skilful workmanship that the fame
            of them travelled throughout the Islands including Santo Domingo and Jamaica and even
            reached Spain. It was said that better lands had never been discovered in the world ;
            and when the pottery idols with so many different * The Havana of to-day. 32 THE
            EXPEDITION DISPERSES. shapes were seen, it was said that they belonged to the Gentiles,
            and others said that they were the work of the Jews whom Titus and Vespasian had turned
            out of Jeru- salem and sent to sea in certain ships which had carried them to this land
            which as Peru was as yet undiscovered (indeed it was not discovered for another twenty
            years) was held in high estimation. There was another matter about which Diego Velasquez
            questioned these Indians, whether there were gold mines in their country, and to all his
            questions they answered by signs " Yes." They were shown gold dust, and they said that
            there was much of it in their land, and they did not speak the truth, for it is clear
            that neither at Cape Catoche nor in all Yucatan are there any mines either of gold or of
            silver. These Indians were also shown the mounds of earth in which the plants are set,
            from the roots of which Cassava bread is made. This plant is called Yuca in the Island
            of Cuba and the Indians said that it grew in their country, and they said Tlati for so
            they call the ground in which the roots are planted ; and, because Yuca and Tlati would
            make Yucatan the Spaniards who had joined in the conversation between Diego Velasquez
            and the Indians, said, ** Senor, these Indians say that their country is called
            Yucutlan'' \ so it kept that name, but in their own language they do not call it by that
            name. I must leave this subject and say that all of us soldiers who went on that voyage
            of discovery spent the little we possessed on it and we returned to Cuba wounded and in
            debt. So each soldier \^ent his own way. and soon after- wards our captain died, and we
            were a long time recovering from our wounds, and according to our count, fifty-seven
            soldiers died, and this was all the profit we gained by that expedition and discovery.
            But Diego Velasquez wrote to the Lor* Councillors who were at that time managing the
            Royal Council of the Indies, to say that he had made THE AUTHOR LEAVES FOR TRINIDAD. 33
            the discovery, and had expended on the expedition a great number of gold dollars, and so
            it was stated and published by Don Juan Rodriguez de Fonseca, Bishop of Burgos and
            Archbishop of Rosano (for thus he was called) who was President of the Council of the
            Indies, and he wrote to that effect to His Majesty in Flanders, giving much credit in
            his letters to Diego Velasquez, and he made no mention of us who made the discovery. Now
            I must stop, and I will tell later about the hardships which befel me and three other
            soldiers. CHAPTER VH. About the hardships I endured on the way to a town called
            Trinidad. I HAVE already said that some of us soldiers who had not yet recovered from
            our wounds remained in Havana, and when we had got better three of us soldiers wished to
            go to the town of Trinidad, and we arranged to go with a certain Pedro de Avila, a
            resident in Havana who was going to make the voyage in a canoe along the southern
            coast.^ The canoe was laden with cotton shirts which Pedro de Avila intended to sell at
            the town of Trinidad. I have already said that the canoes are made like hollow troughs,
            and in these countries they are used for paddling along the coasts. The arrangement we
            made with Avila was that we should give him ten gold dollars to take us in his canoe. So
            we set out along the coast, sometimes rowing and sometimes sailing, and after eleven
            days travelling, when near a village of friendly Indians, called Canarreo, which *
            Bernal Diaz crossed overland to San CristÃ³val de Havanaâ the Havana of that timeâ
            situated on the south coast (pn the river Onicaxinal, see Orozcoy Berra, vol. iv., p.
            71), and thence took canoe to Trinidad 34 WRECK OF THE CANOE. was the boundary of the
            township of Trinidad, there arose such a heavy gale in the night that the canoe could
            not make headway against the sea although we were all of us rowing, as well as Pedro de
            Ãvila and some Indians from Havana, very good rowers whom we had hired to come with us ;
            we were cast upon some rocks {Seborucos\ which thereabouts are very large, and in so
            doing the canoe went to pieces and Avila lost his property. We all got ashore disabled
            and naked to the skin, for so as to swim more freely in our efforts to keep the canoe
            from breaking up we had thought it best to take off all our clothes. Having escaped from
            that mishap we found that there was no trail along the coast to the town of Trinidad,
            nothing but rough ground and Seborucos as they call them, stones that pierce the soles
            of one's feet ; moreover the waves continually broke over us, and we had nothing
            whatever to eat. To shorten the list of hardships I will leave out all one might say
            about the bleeding from our feet and other parts of our bodies. It pleased God that
            after great toil we came out on a sandy beach, and after travelling along it for two
            days we arrived at an Indian village named Yaguarama, which at that time belonged to
            Padre Fray BartolomÃ© de las Casas who was the parish priest, whom I afterwards knew as a
            doctor and a Dominican friar, and who afterwards became Bishop of Chiapas, â and at,
            that village they gave us food. Next day we went on to a village called Chipiana which
            belonged to Alonzo de Avila, and a certain Sandoval, (not the Captain Sandoval of New
            Spain, but another, a native of Tudela de Duero) and from there we went to Trinidad. A
            friend and countryman of mine named Antonio de Medina supplied me with some clothes,
            such as are worn in the Island. From Trinidad with my poverty and hardships I went to
            Santiago de Cuba where lived ARRIVAL AT SANTIAGO DE CUBA. 35 the Governor, who received
            me with a good grace ; he was already making haste to send off another fleet. When I
            went to pay my respects to him, for we were kinsmen, he joked with me, and going from
            one subject to another, asked me if I was well enough to return to Yucatan, and I,
            laughing, asked him who had given the name Yucatan for in that country it was not so
            called, and he replied, "the Indians you brought back with you call it so," so I told
            him " you had better call it the land where half the soldiers who went there were killed
            and all those who escaped death were wounded." He answered, " I know that you suffered
            many hardships, that always happens to those who set out to discover new lands and gain
            honour, and His Majesty will reward you, and I will write to him about it, and now my
            son, go again in the fleet I am getting ready and I will tell the Captain Juan de
            Grijalva to treat you with honour." , I will stop here and relate what happened later.
            Here ends the discovery made by Francisco Hernandez whom Bernal Diaz del Castillo
            accompanied ; â Let us relate what Diego Velasquez was proposing to do. D 2 THE
            EXPEDITION UNDER JUAN DE GRIJALVA. CHAPTER VIII. How Diego Velasquez, Governor of the
            Island of Cuba, ordered another fleet to be sent to the lands which we had discovered
            and a kinsman of his, a nobleman named Juan de Grijalva, went as Captain General,
            besides three other Captains, whose names I will give later on. In the year 1518 the
            Governor of Cuba hearing the good account of the land which we had discovered, which is
            called Yucatan, decided to send out another fleet, and made search for four vessels to
            compose it Two of these vessels were two of the three which had accompanied Francisco
            Hernandez, the other two were vessels which Diego Velasquez bought with his own money.
            At the time the fleet was being fitted out, there were present in Santiago de Cuba,
            where Velasquez resided Juan de Grijalva, Alonzo de Avila, Francisco de Montejo, and
            Pedro de Alvarado, who had come to see the Governor on business, for all of them held
            encomiendas of Indians in the Island. As they were men of dis- tinction, it was agreed
            that Juan de Grijalva who was a kinsman of Diego Velasquez, should go as Captain
            General, that Alonzo de Avila, Pedro de Alvarado, and Francisco de Montejo should each
            have command of a ship. Each of these Captains contributed the provisions and stores of
            Cassava bread and salt pork, and Diego Velasquez provided the four ships, crossbows and
            guns, some beads and other articles of small value for barter. Series II. Vol. XXIll.

            and a small supply of beans. Then Diego Velasquez ordered that I should go with these
            Captains as ensign. As the report had spread that the lands were very rich and that
            there were masonry houses there, and the Indian Julianillo whom we had brought from Cape
            Catoche had said that there was gold, the soldiers and settlers who possessed no Indians
            in Cuba were greedily eager to go to the new land, so that 240 companions were soon got
            together. Then every one of us, out of his own funds, added what he could of stores and
            arms and other suitable things ; and I set out again on this voyage as ensign, as I have
            already stated. As /ar as I can make out the instructions given by the Governor were
            that we should obtain by barter all the gold and silver that could be procured, and that
            if it appeared to be advisable to form a settlement, and if we could venture to do so,
            that a settlement should be made, but if not that then we should return to Cuba. There
            came with us, as Veedor of the fleet, a man named Peiialosa, a native of Segovia, and we
            took with us a priest named Juan Diaz, a native of Seville, and the same two pilots who
            were with us on the former voyage, namely, Anton de Alaminos of Palos, Camacho of
            Triana, besides Juan Alvarez el Manquillo, from Huelva, and there was also another pilot
            who called himself Sopuesta, who came from Moguer. Before I go any further, as I shall
            have to speak many times of these hidalgos who were our Captains, and it seems to me
            discourteous merely to give their names, let it be known that later on they all become
            persons of title ; Pedro de Alvarado became Adelantado^ and Governor of Guatemala and a
            Commander of the Order of Santiago, * Adelantado = Govemor-in-chieÂ£ 38 THE STORY OF

            did not have the same luck as the others for he was captured by the French, as I will
            relate later on in the chapter which treats of the subject I shall speak of these
            gentlemen simply by their own names, until such time as His Majesty conferred on them
            the dignities I have mentioned. To return to my story ; we set out in the four ships
            along the north coast to a port called Matanzas, near to the old Havana,^ (for at that
            time Havana was not in its present position), and in that port most of the settlers of
            Havana had their farms whence the ships obtained all the supplies they needed of Cassava
            and 'pork, for, as I have already said, there were as yet neither sheep nor cattle in
            Cuba, for the Island was but lately conquered. Here we were joined by the Captains and
            soldiers who were going to make the voyage. Before going on, although it does not
            concern the story, I wish to say why this port was called Matanzas. I call it to mind
            because I have been asked the question by a historian in Spain who records matters that
            have hap- pened, and this is the reason why the name was given it Before the Island of
            Cuba was conquered a ship with more than thirty Spanish men and two women on board was
            driven ashore on the coast near the river and port now called Matanzas. Many Indians
            from Havana and the neighbouring towns came out with the intention of killing the
            Spaniards, but as the Indians did not dare to attack them on land, they offered, with
            fair words and flattery, to ferry the Spaniards in canoes across the river, which is
            very large and rapid, and to take them to their houses and give them food. When the
            middle of the river was reached, the Indians ^ Axaruco. DISCOVERY OF COZUMEL. 39 upset
            the canoes and killed all the Spaniards except three men and one woman who was beautiful
            and was carried off by one of the caciques concerned in the plot, and the three Spanish
            men were divided among the other caciques. This is the reason why the place is called
            Matanzas.^ I knew the woman, and after the conquest of Cuba she was taken from the
            Cacique in whose power she had been, and I saw her married to a settler named Pedro
            Sanchez Farfan in the town of Trinidad. I also knew the three Spaniards, one was named
            Gonzalo Mejia, an old man from Jerez, another was Juan SantistÃ©ban, a youth from
            Madrigal, and the other was called Cascorro* a seaman, a native of Moguer. I have
            delayed too long in telling this old tale, and it will be said that in spinning old
            yarns I am forgetting my narrative, so let us get back to it : â As soon as all of us
            soldiers had got together and the pilots had received their instructions and the lantern
            signals had been arranged, after hearing mass, we set out on the 8th April, 1518. In ten
            days we doubled the point of Guaniguanico which is also called San Anton and after eight
            days sailing we sighted the Island of Cozumel,' which was then first discovered, for
            with the current that was running we made much more lee-way than when we came with
            Francisco Hernandez de Cordova, and we went along the south side of the Island and
            sighted a town with a * /.^., the place of killing. â¢ The Alonzo RemÃ³n Edition adds : "
            The cacique with whom he stayed married him to his daughter, and he had his ears and
            nose pierced like an Indian." ' This would imply that land was first sighted on the 26th
            April. The Itinerario says that the fleet left Cuba on the ist May, and that land was
            sighted on the 3rd May, and as it was the day of Santa Cruz they gave the land that
            name. 40 THE StÃRV Of THE CAKOE TtÃ­AT DRlfTEÃ few houses, near which was a good
            anchorage free from reefs. We went on shore with the Captain and a large company of
            soldiers, and the natives of the town had taken to flight as soon as they saw the ships
            coming under sail, for they had never seen such a thing before. We soldiers who landed
            found two old men, who could not walk far, hidden in the maize fields and we brought
            them to the Captain. With the help of the two Indians Julianillo and Melchorejo whom
            Francisco Hernandez brought away, who thoroughly understood that language (for there is
            not more than four leagues of sea between their land and the Island of Cozumel, and the
            language is the same) the captain spoke kindly to these old men and gave them some beads
            and sent them off to summon the cacique of the town, and they went off and never came
            back again. While we were waiting, a good-looking Indian woman appeared and b^an to
            speak in the language of the Island of Jamaica, and she told us that all the men and
            women of the town had fled to the woods for fear of us. As I and many of our soldiers
            knew the language she spoke very well, for it is the same as that spoken in Cuba, we
            were very much astonished, and asked the woman how she happened to be there ; she
            replied that two years earlier she had started from Jamaica with ten Indians in a large
            canoe intending to go and fish near some small islands, and that the currents had
            carried them over to this land where they had been driven ashore, and that her husband
            and all the Jamaica Indians had been killed and sacrificed to the Idols. When the
            Captain heard this it seemed to him that this woman would serve very well as a
            messenger, so he sent her to summon the people and caciques of the town, and he gave her
            two days in which to go and return. We were afraid that the tkONÃ JAMAÃCA to YÃCATAtÃ­.
            4I Indians Melchorejo and Julianillo if once they got away from us would go off to their
            own country which was near by, and on that account we could not trust them as
            messengers. To return to the Indian woman from Jamaica, the answer she brought was that
            notwithstanding her efforts she could not persuade a single Indian to approach us. We
            called the town Santa Cruz because it was the day of Santa Cruz when we first entered it
            ; we found there very good hives of honey and many sweet potatoes, and herds of the pigs
            of the country which have the navel* above the spine. There are three townships on the
            Island, the one where we landed being the largest and the other two smaller, and each
            one stood at one end of the island, these I saw and visited when I returned the third
            time with Cortez. The Island is about two leagues* in circumference. I must go on to say
            that as the Captain Juan de Grijalva saw that it would be merely losing time tÂ© wait
            there any longer, he ordered us to go on board ship, and the Indian woman went with us,
            and we continued our voyage.' ^ A scent gland. * This must be a misprint for " twenty
            leagues," for the island is at least fifty-five miles in circumference. ' From the
            accounts given in the Itinerario de Grijalva and in the letter written to Charles V by
            the Municipality of Vera Cruz (loth July, 1 5 19) it seems clear that on leaving
            Cozumel, Grijalva sailed for about fifty miles southwards along the east coast of
            Yucatan until he reached the Bay of Ascension, which he named, and then turned north
            again and rounded Cape Catoche. In this passage the author of the Itinerario says, '*
            Arrived at the coast we saw three large towns separated about two miles one from the
            other, and we saw in them many stone houses and very high towers, and many houses of
            thatch." Possibly this town was what is now known as the Ruins of Tulum. 4^ AkRIVEÃ At
            CÃÃANt^OTÃN. CHAPTER IX. H ow we followed the same course that we had taken with
            Francisco Hernandez de Cordova ; how we landed at Chanpoton and how an attack was made
            on us, and what else happened. As soon as we were all on board we kept on the old
            course, the same that was followed by Francisco Hernandez de Cordova, and in eight days
            we reached the neighbourhood of the town of Chanpoton which was the place where the
            Indians of that province had defeated us, as I have already related in a former chapter.
            As the tide runs out very far in the bay, we anchored our ships a league from the shore
            and then making use of all the boats we disembarked half the soldiers close to the
            houses of the town. The Indians of the town and others from the neighbour- hood at once
            assembled, as they had done on the other occasion when they killed over fifty-six of our
            soldiers and wounded all the rest, as I have already related, and for that reason they
            were now very proud and haughty, and they were well armed in their own manner with bows,
            arrows, and lances, some of them as long as our lances and some of them shorter, and
            shields and macanas and two-handed swords and slings and stones, and they wore cotton
            armour and carried trumpets and drums, and many of them had their faces painted black
            and others red and white. They were drawn up in array and awaited us on the shore, ready
            to fall on us as we landed. As we had already gained experience from our former
            expedition, we had brought with us in the boat some falconets and were well supplied
            with crossbows and guns. As we approached the shore they began to shoot arrows and hurl
            lances at us with all their might, and although we did them much damage with our
            falconets, such a hail storm of arrows fell on us before we could land that half of us
            were wounded As soon as all the soldiers got on shore DEFEAT OF THE INDIANS AT
            CÃANPOTON. 43 we checked their ardour with our good sword play and with our crossbows,
            and although they still shot at us as at targets, we all wore cotton armour, yet they
            kept up the fight against us for a good while until we drove them back into some swamps
            near to the town. In this fight seven soldiers were killed, among them Juan de Quiteria,
            a man of importance, and our Captain Juan de Grijalva received three arrow wounds, and
            had two of his teeth broken, and more than sixty of us were wounded.* When we saw that
            all the enemy had taken to flight we entered the town and attended to the wounded and
            buried the dead. We could not find a single person in the town, nor could we find those
            who had retreated into the swamp for they had all disappeared. In that skirmish we
            captured three Indians one of whom was a chief, and the Captain sent them off to summon
            the cacique of the town, giving them clearly to understand through the interpreters
            Julianillo and Melchorejo that they were pardoned for what they had done, and he gave
            them some green beads to hand to the cacique as a sign of peace, and they went off and
            never returned again. So we believed that the Indians, Julianillo and Melchorejo had not
            repeated to the prisoners what they had been told to say to them but had said something
            quite different. At that town we stayed for three days. I remember that this fight took
            place in some fields where there were many locusts, and while we were fighting they
            jumped up and came flying in our faces, and as the Indian archers were pouring a hail
            storm of arrows on us we sometimes mistook the arrows for locusts and did not shield
            ourselves from them and so got wounded ; at other times we thought that they were arrows
            coming towards ^ The author of the IHnerario and the Letter from the Municipality of

            hampered our fighting. I must leave this and go on to tell how we embarked and kept on
            our course. CHAPTER X. How we went on our way and entered a large and broad river to
            which we then gave the name of the Boca de TÃ©rminos. Keeping on our course we reached
            what seemed to be the mouth of a very rapid river, very broad and open, but it was not a
            river as we at first thought it to be, but it was a very good harbour. Because there was
            land on both sides of us and the water was so wide that it looked like a strait, the
            pilot Alaminos said that here the Island ended and the main- land began, and that was
            the reason why we called it the Boca de TÃ©rminos,^ and so it is named on the charts. The
            Captain Juan de Grijalva went ashore with all the other Captains already mentioned and
            many soldiers. We spent three days taking soundings at the mouth of the strait and
            exploring up and down the bay until we came to the end of it, and found out that there
            was no island, but that we were in a bay which formed a very good harbour. On shore we
            found some houses built of masonry, used as oratories of their Idols, and many Idols of
            pottery, wood and stone, which were the images of their gods, and some of them were
            figures of women * It is not quite clear by which opening the vessels entered the Laguna
            de Terminos. Orozco y Berra {Hist Antigua^ vol. iv, page 31) says at the Puerto
            Escondidoâ it seems more likely to have been at the Puerto Real. Had they entered by the
            west entrance or Puerto Principal they must have attracted the attention of the people
            of Xicolango, then a considerable town and a Mexican outpost (See Relacion de Melchor de
            Alfaro Santa Crux in Colecdon de Documentos Ineditos^ Reladones de Yucatan^ vol. ii.
            Madrid, 1898). DISCOVERY OF THE RIO DE TABASCO. 45 and others figures of serpents and
            there were many deer's antlers. We thought there must be a town close by, and as it was
            such a safe port we considered that it would be a good place for a settlement, but we
            found out that it was altogether uninhabited, and that the oratories were merely those
            belonging to traders and hunters who put into the port when passing in their canoes and
            made sacrifices there. We had much deer and rabbit hunting and with the help of a
            lurcher we killed ten deer and many rabbits. At last when we had finished our soundings
            and explorations we made ready to go on board ship, but the lurcher got left behind. The
            sailors call this place the Puerto de TÃ©rminos. As soon as we were all on board we kept
            our course close along the shore until we arrived at a river which they call the Rio de
            Tabasco, which we named Rio de Grijalva. CHAPTER XI. How we arrived at the Rio de
            Tabasco which we named the River Grijalva, and what happened to us there. Making our way
            along the coast towards the west, by day, but not daring to sail during the night for
            fear of shoals and reefs, at the end of three days we came in sight of the mouth of a
            very broad river, and we went near in shore with the ships, as it looked like a good
            port. As we came nearer in we saw the water breaking over the bar at the mouth of the
            river, so we got out boats, and by sounding we found out that the two larger vessels
            could not enter the river, so it was agreed that they should anchor outside in the sea,
            and that all the soldiers should go up the river in the other two vessels which drew
            less water and in the boats. 46 SPANIARDS LAND NEAR THE TOWN. This we did because we saw
            many Indians in canoes along the banks of the river armed with bows and arrows and other
            weapons, after the manner of the people of Chanpoton, and we knew that there must be a
            large town in the neighbourhood. As we had coasted along we had already seen nets set in
            the sea for catching iish, and had gone in the boat which was towed astern of the
            flagship and had taken fish out of two of them. This river was called the Rio de Tabasco
            because the chief of the town called himself Tabasco, and as we discovered it on this
            voyage and Juan de Grijalva was its discoverer, we named it the Rio de Grijalva and so
            it is marked on the charts. To go back to my story, when we arrived within half a league
            of the town we could hear the sound of chopping wood for the Indians were making
            barriers and stockades and getting ready to give us battle. When we were aware of this,
            so as to make certain, we disembarked half a league from the town on a point of land
            where some palm trees were growing. When the Indians saw us there a fleet of fifty
            canoes approached us full of warriors clad in cotton armour and carrying bows and
            arrows, lances and shields, drums and plumes of feathers. Many other canoes full of
            warriors were lying in the creeks, and they kept a little way off as though they did not
            dare to approach as did the first fleet. When we perceived their intentions we were on
            the point of firing at them with guns and crossbows, but it pleased God that we agreed
            to call out to them, and through Julianillo and Melchorejo, who spoke their language
            very well, we told them that they need have no fear, that we wished to talk to them, for
            we had things to tell them which when they understood them they would be glad that we
            bad cpme to their country and their homes, PARLEY WITH THE INDIANS, 47 Moreover, we
            wished to give them some of the things we had brought with us. As they understood what
            was said to them, four of the canoes came near with about thirty Indians in them, and we
            showed them strings of green beads and small mirrors and blue cut glass beads,^ and as
            soon as they saw them they assumed a more friendly manner, for they thought that they
            were chal- chihuite^ which they value greatly. Then through Julianillo and Melchorejo as
            interpreters, the Captain told them that we came from a distant country and were the
            vassals of a great Emperor named Don Carlos, who had many great lords and chiefs as his
            vassals, and that they ought to acknowledge him as their lord, and it would be to their
            advantage to do so, and that in return for the beads they might bring us some food and
            poultry. Two of the Indians answered us, one of them was a chief and the other was a
            Papa, that is, a sort of priest who has care of their Idols, for as I have said before,
            in New Spain they are called Papas. They replied that they would bring the food which we
            asked for, and would barter their things for ours ; but as for the rest, they already
            had a chief, that we were only just now arrived and knew nothing about them, and yet we
            wanted to give them a chief. Let us beware not to make war on them as we had done at
            Potonchan,* for they had more than three jiquipiUs of warriors from all the provinces
            around in readiness {ewtry jiqMtptl numbers eight thousand men) and they said that they
            were well aware that only a few days earlier we had killed and wounded more than two
            hundred men at Potonchan* but that they were not ^ Literally, blue diamonds. '

            Chanpoton. 48 THE INDIANS BRING PRESENTS. weaklings such as those, and for this reason
            they had come to talk to us and find out what we wanted, and that whatever we should
            tell them they would go and report to the chiefs of many towns who had assembled to
            decide on peace or war. Then our Captain embraced the Indians as a sign of peace, and
            gave them some strings of beads and told them to go and bring back an answer as soon as
            possible, but he said that although we did not wish to anger them, that if they did not
            return we should have to force our way into their town. These messengers whom we sent
            spoke to the Caciques and Papas, who also have a voice in their affairs, and they
            decided that it was better to keep the peace and supply us with food, and that between
            them and the neighbouring towns they would soon seek a present of gold to give us and
            secure our friendship, so that what had happened to the people of Potonchan^ would not
            happen to them. From what I saw and learnt afterwards, it is the custom in these
            provinces, and in other countries in New Spain to give presents when making peace, and
            this will be clearly seen later on. The following day more than thirty Indians with
            their chief came to the promontory under the palm trees where we were camped and brought
            roasted fish and fowls, and zapote fruit and maize bread, and brasiers with live coals
            and incense, and they fumigated us all. Then they spread on the ground some mats, which
            here they call petateSy and over them a cloth, and they presented some golden jewels,
            some were diadems, and others were in the shape of ducks, like those in Castille, and
            other jewels like lizards and three necklaces of hollow beads, and other articles of
            gold but not of much value, for they were not ^ Chanpoton, THE SPANIARDS HEAR OF MEXICO.
            49 worth more than two hundred dollars. They also brought some cloaks and skirts, such
            as they wear, and said that we must accept these things in good part as they had no more
            gold to give us, but that further on, in the direction of the sunset, there was plenty
            of gold, and they said " Colua, Colua, MÃ©jico, MÃ©jico," but we did not know what this
            Colua or MÃ©jico could be. Although the present that they brought us was not worth much,
            we were satisfied, because we thus knew for certain that they possessed gold. As soon as
            they had given their present they said that we should at once set out on our way and the
            Captain, Juan de Grijalva, thanked them for their gift and gave them a present of beads.
            It was decided that we should go on board at once, for the two ships were in much danger
            should a northerly gale blow for it would put them on a lee shore, and moreover we
            wanted to get nearer to where we were told there was gold. CHAPTER XII. How we followed
            along the coast towards the setting sun, and arrived at a river called the Rio de
            Banderas, and what happened there. We returned on board and set our course along the
            coast and in two days came in sight of a town called Ayagualulco, and many of the
            Indians from that town marched along the shore with shields made of the shells of
            turtle, which sparkled as the sun shone on them, and some of our soldiers contended that
            they were made of low grade gold. The Indians who carried them as they marched along the
            sandy beach, knowing that they were at a safe distance, 1 \ 50 VOYAGE ALONG THE MEXICAN
            COAST. cut capers, as though mocking at the ships. We gave the town the name of La
            Rambla, and it is thus marked on the charts. Coasting along we came in sight of a bay
            into which flows the river TonalÃ¡, which we entered on our return journey and named the
            Rio de San Antonio, and so it is marked on the charts. As we sailed along we noted the
            position of the great river Coatzacoalcos, and we wished to enter the bay [not merely]
            to see what it was like, but because the weather was unfavourable. Soon we came in sight
            of the great snow mountains, which have snow on them all the year round, and we saw
            other mountains, nearer to the sea, which we called the range of San Martin, and we gave
            it that name because the first man to see them was a soldier from Havana who had come
            with us named San Martin. As we followed along the coast, the Captain Pedro de Alvarado,
            went ahead with his ship and entered a river which the Indians call Papaloapan, and
            which we then called the Rio de Alvarado because Alvarado was the first to enter it.
            There, some Indian fishermen, natives of a town called Tlacotalpa gave him some fish. We
            waited at the mouth of the river with the other three ships until Alvarado came out, and
            the General was very angry with him for going up the river without his permission, and
            ordered him never to go ahead of the other ships again, lest an accident should happen
            when we could not give him help. We kept on our course, all four ships together until we
            arrived at the mouth of another river, which we called the Rio de Banderas,^ because we
            there came on a great number of Indians with long lances, and on every ^ Rio de Banderas

            cloth banner which they waved as they beckoned to us. And what happened I will tell in
            the next chapter. CHAPTER XIII. How we arrived at the Rio de Banderas and what happened
            there. Some studious readers in Spain and other people who have been to New Spain, may
            have heard that Mexico was a very great city built in the water like Venice, and that it
            was governed by a great prince who was King over many provinces and ruled over all the
            lands of New Spain, a territory which is more than twice as large as Castille, and that
            this Prince was called Montezuma, and that as he was so powerful he wished to extend his
            rule beyond what was possible. He had received news of our arrival when we came first,
            with Francisco Hernandez de Cordova, and of what had happened at the battle of Catoche
            and at Chanpoton, and also what had happened at the battle at this same Chanpoton during
            this voyage, and he knew that we soldiers being few in number had defeated the warriors
            of that town and their very numerous allies, and he knew as well that we had entered the
            Rio Tabasco and what had taken place between us and the caciques of that town, moreover
            he understood that our object was to seek for gold, in exchange for the tHÃ­Ã­Tgs we
            te'd'^ brought with us. All this news had been brought to him painted on a cloth made of
            hennequen^ which is like linen, and as he knew ) that we were coasting along towards his
            provinces he sent j orders to his governors that if we should arrive in their ^

            cordage. E 2 \ -y J. / 52 AN ANCIENT INDIAN PROPHECY. 1^ J neighbourhood with our ships
            that they should barter I gold for our beads, especially the green beads, which are
            something like their chalchihuites, which they value as . highly as emeralds ; he also
            ordered them to find out more about our persons and our plans. It is a fact, as we now
            know, that their Indian ancestors had foretold that men with beards would come from the
            direction of the sunrise and would rule over them. What- j ever the reason may have been
            many Indians sent by the I Great Montezuma were watching for us at the river 1 have I
            mentioned with long poles, and on every pole a banner of Iwhite cotton cloth, which they
            waved and called to us, as Ithough making signals of peace, to come to them. When from
            the ships we saw such an unusual sight we were fairly astonished, and the general and
            most of the Captains were agreed that to find out what it meant we should lower two of
            the boats, and that all those who carried guns or crossbows and twenty of the most
            daring and active soldiers should go in them, and that Francisco de Montejo should
            accompany us, and that if we should discover that the men who were waving the banners
            were warriors that we should at once bring news of it and of anything else that we could
            find out. Thank God at that time we had fine weather which is rare enough on this coast.
            When we got on shore we found three Caciques, one of them the governor appointed by
            Montezuma, who had many of the Indians of his house- hold with him. They brought many of
            the fowls of the country and maize bread such as they always eat, and fruits such as
            pineapples and zapotes, which in other parts are called mameies, and they were seated
            under the shade of the trees, and had spread mats on the ground, and they invited us to
            be seated, all by signs, for Julianillo the man from Cape Catoche, did not under- stand
            their language which is Mexican. Then they Bartering for jewels of gold. 53 brought
            pottery braziers with live coals, and fumigated us with a sort of resin. As soon as the
            Captain Montejo had reported all that had taken place to the general, he [the captain
            general] determined to anchor his ships and go ashore with all his captains and
            soldiers. When the Caciques and governors saw him on land and knew that he was the
            Captain General of us all, according to their custom, they paid him the greatest
            respect. In return he treated them in a most caressing manner and ordered them to be
            given blue and green glass beads aqd by signs he made them under- stand that they should
            bring gold to barter with us. Then the Governor sent orders to all the neighbouring
            towns to bring jewels to exchange with us, and during the six days that we remained
            there they brought more than sixteen thousand dollars worth of jewelry of low grade
            gold, worked into various forms. This must be the gold which the historians GÃ³mara,
            Yllescas and Jovio say was given by the natives of Tabasco, and they have written it
            down as though it were true, although it is well known to eye witnesses that there is no
            gold in the Province of the Rio de Grijalva or anywhere near it and very few jewels.
            When the General saw that the Indians were not bringing any more gold to barter, and as
            we had already been there six days and the ships ran risk of danger from the North and
            North East wind, he thought it was time to embark. So we took [formal] possession of the
            land in the name of His Majesty, and as soon as this had been done the General spoke to
            the Indians and told them that we wished to return to our ships and he gave them
            presents of some shirts from Spain. We took one of the Indians from this place on board
            ship with us, and after he had learnt our language he became a Christian and was named
            54 THE ISLA DE SACRIFICIOS. Francisco, and later on I met him living with his Indian
            wife. As we sailed on along the coast we sighted an Island^ of white sand which the sea
            washed over, it appeared to be .about three leagues distant from the land, and we called
            it the Isla Blanca and it is marked thus on the charts. Not far from the Isla Blanca we
            observed another Island with many green trees on it, lying about four leagues from the
            coast and we gave it the name of Isla Verde and going on further we saw an Island
            somewhat larger than the others about a league and a half off the shore, and in front of
            it there was a good roadstead where the General gave orders for the ships to come to
            anchor. ' As soon as the boats were launched the Captain Juan de Grijalva and many of us
            soldiers went off to visit the Island for we saw smoke rising from it, and we found two
            inasonry houses very well built, each house with steps â  leading up to some altars, and
            on these altars were idols ." ivith evil looking bodies, which were the gods of the :
            /Indians and that very night five Indians had been sacri- /ficed before them ; their
            chests had been cut open, and I the arms and thighs had been cut off and the walls were
            I covered with blood. At all this we stood greatly .amazed, and gave the Island the name
            of the Isla de Sacriiicios and it is so marked on the charts. We all of us went ashore
            opposite that Island, and on the broad sandy beach we put up huts and shelters made with
            branches of trees and sails taken from the ships. Now many Indians had come down to the
            coast bringing gold made into small articles which they wished to barter as they had
            done at the Rio de Banderas, and, as we 1 Bemal Diaz is not quite correct about the
            comparative size of the Islands. The. accompanying chart shows their size and position.
            SAN JUAN DE ULUA. 55 afterwards found out the great Montezuma had ordered them to do so.
            These Indians who brought the gold were very timid and the gold was small in quantity,
            for this reason the Captain Juan de, Grijalva ordered the anchors to be raised and sail
            set, and we went on to anchor opposite another Island, about half a league from land,
            and it is at this Island that the port of Vera Cruz is now established. CHAPTER XIV. How
            we arrived at the Island now called San Juan de UlÃºa, and the reason why that name was
            given to it, and what happened to us there. We landed on a sandy beach, and so as to
            escape the swarms of mosquitos we built huts on the tops of the highest sand dunes,
            which are very extensive in these parts. From our boats we made careful soundings of the
            harbour and found that there was a good bottom and that under the shelter of the Island
            our ships would be safe from the Northerly gales. As soon as this was done the General
            and thirty of us soldiers, well armed, went in two boats to the Island and we found
            there a temple where there was a very large and ugly idol which was called Tescatepuca^
            and in charge of it were four Indians with very large black cloaks and hoods, such as
            the Dominicans or canons wear, or very much like them, and these were the priests of the
            idols, and they are commonly called Papas in New Spain, as I have said before. They had
            this day sacrificed two boys and cut open ^ TeUcatlipoca. $6 HUMAN SACRIFICES. their
            chests, and offered the blood and hearts to that cursed Idol. The priests came towards
            us to fumigate us with the incense with which they had fumigated their Tescatepuca, for
            when we approached them they were burning something which had the scent of incense, but
            we would not allow them to fumigate us, for we all felt much pity at seeing those two
            boys who had just been killed and at beholding such great cruelty. The General asked the
            Indian Francisco, already mentioned by me, whom we had brought from the Rio de Banderas,
            and who seemed to be fairly intelligent what they had done this for, and Francisco by
            means of signs (we had no inter- preter, for as I have already said, Julianillo and
            Melchorejo did not understand the Mexican language) replied that the people of Culua had
            ordered the sacrifice to be made. As he was halting in his speech he said Uliia, Ulua,
            and as our Captain who was present was named Juan, and it was the day of San Juan in
            June, we called the Island San . Juan de Ulua. This port is now very well known, and
            great shelter walls have been erected so as to protect the ships from the North wind,
            and it is here that all the merchandise from Castille for Mexico and New Spain is
            landed. To go back to my story, while we were encamped on the sand hills, Indians from
            the towns round about came to barter gold and jewels in exchange for our goods, but they
            brought so few things and those of such poor value that we took no count of it. We
            stayed there for seven days, but we could not endure the mosquitos, and seeing that we
            were wasting time, and as we now knew for certain that these lands were not Islands but
            the Mainland, and that it contained large towns and multitudes of Indians, and seeing
            that our cassava bread was very mouldy and dirty with weevils and was going sour, and
            that the soldiers of our company ALVARAt)0 RETURNS TO CUfiA. $7 were not numerous enough
            to form a settlement, all the more so as thirteen soldiers had died of their wounds, and
            four others were still suffering, so taking all I have said into consideration it was
            agreed that we should send to inform the Governor Diego Velasquez of our condition, so
            that he could send us help. Juan de Grijalva had the greatest desire to form a settle-
            ment even with the few soldiers he had with him, and always showed the courage of a very
            valiant and energetic Captain, and was not such a man as the historian GÃ³mara describes.
            It was therefore decided that the Captain Pedro de Alvarado should go in a very good
            ship called the San Sebastian to carry the message. This was agreed to for two reasons,
            one was that Juan de Grijalva and the other captains were not on good terms with
            Alvarado on account of his entry into the Rio Papaloapan (which we then named the Rio
            Alvarado) the other reason was that Alvarado had come on this voyage unwillingly, as he
            was far from well. It was also arranged that the sick men and all the gold and the cloth
            which had been gained by barter should be sent back in the San Sebastian, The Captains
            wrote to Diego Velasquez, each one what he thought fit, and then the ship set sail and
            made for the Island of Cuba, and there I will leave them for the present, both Pedro de
            Alvarado and his voyage, and will tell how Diego Velasquez had sent in search of us. 58
            ANXIETY or DIEGO VELASQUEZ. CHAPTER XV. How Diego Velasquez, the Governor of Cuba, sent
            a ship in search of us, and what else happened. No soorrer had we sailed from the Island
            of Cuba on our voyage with Captain Juan de Grijalva, than Diego Velasquez began to be
            anxious lest some calamity had befallen us, and he was always longing for news of us, so
            he sent a small ship with some soldiers in search of us, under the command of CristÃ³val
            de Olid, a person of consideration and very energetic (who was afterwards Maestro de
            CampÃ³^ in the expedition under Cortes). Diego Velasquez ordered him to follow the track
            of Francisco Hernandez de Cordova until he should overtake us. It appears that CristÃ³val
            de Olid, when he went in search of us, was struck by a heavy gale while anchored near
            the coast of Yucatan, and the pilot whom they had on board, so as to save the vessel
            from* foundering at anchor, ordered the cables to be cut, so they lost their anchors and
            returned to Santiago de Cuba. Diego Velasquez was at the port and heard that they
            brought no news of us, and if he was anxious before, he was doubly so now. However,
            about this time the Captain, Pedro de Alvarado, arrived with the gold, and the cloth,
            and the sick men, and with the whole story of what we had discovered ; and when the
            Governor beheld the gold jewelry that the Captain Pedro de Alvarado had brought with
            him, he greatly overestimated its value. There were present with Diego Velasquez many
            in- habitants from the city and from other parts of the Island, who had come on
            business, and when the king's ^ Quartermaster. Series II. Vol. XXIIl. HERRERA, DECADE

            to His Majesty, they were astonished at our having discovered such rich lands, (for Peru
            was not discovered until twenty years later). Pedro de Alvarado knew very well how to
            tell his story, and they say that Diego Velasquez could do nothing but embrace him, and
            order great rejoicings and sports for eight days. Report had been rife enough before
            about these rich lands, and with the arrival of the gold it rose to exaggeration
            throughout the Islands and in Castille, as I shall tell later on ; but I must leave
            Diego Velasquez keeping holiday, and return to our ships which were at San Juan de UlÃºa,
            and I shall go on to relate how we agreed to proceed with our exploration of the coast.
            CHAPTER XVI. How we went on exploring the coast as far as the Province of Panuco, and
            what else happened before our return to Cuba. After the Captain, Pedro de Alvarado had
            left us to go to the Island of Cuba, (as I have already related) it was decided by the
            General, Captains, and soldiers, and approved of by the Pilots, that we should keep in
            close to the shore and discover all that we were able on the coast. Keeping on our
            course we came in sight of the 3ierra de Tuztla,^ and further on, two days later, we saw
            some other higher ranges which are now called the Sierra de Tuzpa, after a town of that
            name near by. As we coasted along, we saw many towns apparently two or * This is an
            error ; the Sierra de Tuxtla lies between the Sierra San Martin and the mouth of the
            Papaloapan River, and had been passed before arriving at San Juan de UlÃºa. It is Tuxpan
            (about lat 20 deg. N } that was now sighted. 6o THE RIO t)E CANOAS- Â« three leagues
            inland and these would belong to the province of Panuco. Continuing our course, we came
            to a great and rapid river which we called the Rio de Canoas^ and dropped anchor at the
            mouth of it. When all three ships were anchored and we were a little off our guard,
            twenty large canoes filled with Indian warriors, armed with bows, arrows, and lances,
            came down the river and made straight for the smallest ship which lay nearest the shore,
            and was commanded by Francisco de Montejo. The Indians shot a flight of arrows which
            wounded five soldiers, and they made fast to the ship with ropes intending to carry her
            off, and even cut one of her cables with their copper axes. However, the captain and
            soldiers fought well, and upset three of the canoes, and we hastened to their assistance
            in our boats, with guns and crossbows, and we wounded more than a third of the Indians,
            so they returned from their unlucky expedition whence they had come. Then we got up
            anchor and set sail and followed along the coast until we came to a great Cape* which
            was most difficult to double, for the currents were so strong we could make no headway.
            Then the Pilot, Alaminos, said to the General, that it was no use trying to go further
            in that direction, and gave many reasons for his opinion. So counsel was taken as to
            what had best be done, and it was settled that we should return to Cuba. One reason for
            this was that the rains* had already begun, and we were short of provisions, and one
            ship was leaking badly. However, the Captains were not of one mind, for Juan de Grijalva
            said that he wanted ^ Orozco y Berra says, in a note (page 55), that this Rio de Canoas

            Montejo objected, saying that they would not be able to hold out against the great
            number of warriors which the country contained, moreover, all of us soldiers were
            thoroughly tired of seafaring. So we turned round and set all sail before the wind, and
            aided by the currents, in a few days we reached the mouth of the great Rio de
            Coatzacoalcos, but we could not enter it on account of unfavourable weather, and going
            close in shore we entered the Rio de TonalÃ¡, to which we gave the name of San Anton.
            There we careened one of the ships which was making water fast, for on entering the
            river she had struck on the bar where the water is very shallow. While we were repairing
            the ship many Indians came in a most friendly manner from the town of TonalÃ¡, which is
            about a league distant, and brought maize bread, and fish and fruit, and gave them to us
            with great good will. The captain showed them much attention and ordered them to be
            given white and green beads, and made signs to them that they should bring gold for
            barter and we would give them our goods in exchange ; so they brought jewels of low
            grade gold, and we gave them beads in return. People came also from Coatzacoalcos and
            the other towns in the neighbourhood and brought jewelry, but this did not amount to
            anything. Besides these things for barter, the Indians of that province usually brought
            with them highly polished copper axes with painted wooden handles, as though for show or
            as a matter of elegance, and we thought that they were made of inferior gold, and began
            to barter for them, and in three days we had obtained more than six hundred, and we were
            very well contented thinking that they were made of debased gold, and the Indians were
            even more contented with their beads, but it was no 62 THE AUTHOR SOWS ORANGE SEEDS.
            good to either party, for the axes were made of copper, and the beads were valueless.
            One sailor had bought seven axes, and was very well pleased with them.* I also remember
            that a soldier named BartolomÃ© Pardo, went to one of the Idol Houses which stood on a
            hill, (which as I have already said are called Cues, which means houses of the Gods) and
            in that house he found many Idols, and copal, which is a resin used as incense, and
            stone knives used for sacrifices and circumcision, and in a wooden chest he found many
            articles of gold, such as diadems and necklaces, and two Idols and some hollow beads.
            The soldier took the gold for himself and the other Idols and offerings he brought to
            the captain. However, someone had seen what was done, and reported it to Grijalva, and
            he wanted to take the gold from the soldier, but we begged that it might be left to him,
            as he was a respectable man, so after the Royal Fifth had been taken for His Majesty,
            the rest was given back to the poor soldier, and it was worth about one hundred and
            fifty dollars.* ^ The Alonzo RemÃ³n Edition says that he bought them secretly, ** and it
            seems that another sailor told this to the captain, and he ordered them to be given up,
            but as we all pleaded for him, thinking that the axes were gold, the captain gave them
            back again." â¢ In the original MSS. the following passage is blotted out : â I sowed the
            seeds of some oranges near to another Idol house, and it happened thus : âThere were so
            many mosquitos near the river that ten of us soldiers went up to sleep in a lofty Idol
            house, and close by that house I sowed the seeds which I had brought from Cuba, for
            there was a rumour that we were coming back to settle, they came up very well, for it
            seems that the Papas, when they saw that they were plants differing from those they
            knew, protected them and watered theni and kept them free from weeds ; and all the
            oranges in that P>;ov"^ce are the descendants of these plants. I know well that it will
            be said that these old tales have nothing to do with my history, so I must leave off
            telling them.âG. G. The Alonzo RemÃ³n Edition adds :â And I have called this to mind
            because these were the first oranges planted in New Spain. After the fall of Mexico,
            when the towns subject to Coatzacoalcos had been pacified, this was looked on as the
            best province, being the best situated in all New Spain, both on account of the mines it
            possessed Series II. Vol. XXllI. Facsimile (reduced) of Title-Page of HERRERA'S **

            Indians of those provinces well contented, and going on board ship again, we went on our
            way towards Cuba,^ and in forty-five days, sometimes with fair weather and at other
            times with bad weather, we arrived at Santiago de Cuba where Diego Velasquez was
            residing, and he gave us a very good reception. When the Governor saw the gold that we
            brought, which was worth four thousand dollars, and with that which had already been
            brought by Pedro de Alvarado, amounted in all to twenty thousand dollars, (and some say
            that it was more) he was well contented. Then the officers of the King took the Royal
            Fifth, but when the six hundred axes which we thought were low grade gold were brought
            out, they were all rusty like copper which they proved to be, and there was a good laugh
            at us, and they made great fun of our trading. The Governor was very pleased at all
            this, but he did not seem to be on good terms with his kinsman Grijalva, and he had no
            cause for it, merely that Francisco de Montejo and Pedro de Alvarado were not on good
            terms with Grijalva, and Alonzo de Avila added to the trouble. As soon as these
            squabbles were over there began to be talk of sending another fleet, and gossip as to
            who would be chosen as captain, but I will leave this for the present and will tell how
            Diego Velasquez sent to Spain to petition His Majesty to give him a commission to trade
            and to conquer, settle and apportion, the lands which had been discovered. as well as
            for its good harbour, for it was a land both rich in gold, and in pasture for cattle.
            For this reason it was settled by the principal Conquistadores of Mexico, of whom I was
            one. So I went to look for my orange trees and transplanted them and they turned out
            very well. * The author of the Itinerario says that they touched at Campeche and secured
            enough maize, water and firewood to supply them for the remainder of the voyage. BOOK
            11. THE EXPEDITION UNDER HERNANDO CORTES. THE VOYAGE. CHAPTER XVII. How Diego Velasquez
            sent to Spain to petition His Majesty to grant him a commission, to trade with, and
            conquer the country, and to settle and apportion the land as soon as peace was
            established. LTHOUGH it may seem to the reader that in relating what I now call to mind,
            I am wandering far away from my story, nevertheless it seems to me proper that, before I
            begin to tell about the valiant and energetic Captain Cortes, certain things should be
            mentioned, both for reasons which will be apparent later on, and because when two or
            three events happen at the same time, one cannot relate them together, but only that one
            which falls into its place in the story. The fact is that when the captain, Pedro de
            Alvarado arrived at Santiago de Cuba with the gold from the lands which we had
            discovered, as I have already related, Diego Velasquez was in fear lest, before he could
            make his report to His Majesty, some court favourite should rob DIEGO VELASQUEZ REPORTS
            TO THE EMPEROR. 65 him of his reward, and ask it from His Majesty for him- self. For
            this reason he sent to Spain his chaplain, named Benito Martinez, a man well skilled in
            business, with the evidence and letters for Don Juan Rodriguez de Fonseca, Bishop of
            Burgos, and Archbishop of Rosano, for such are his titles, and to the Licentiate, Luis
            Zapata, and to the Secretary, Lope de Conchillos, who at th^t time looked after the
            Affairs of the Indies. Diego Velasquez was the very humble servant of them all,
            especially of the Bishop, and he gave them Indian townships in the Island of Cuba, so
            that their inhabitants might extract gold from the mines for them, and for this reason
            they were ready to do much for Diego Velasquez. At this time His Majesty was away in
            Flanders. Velas- quez also sent to these gentlemen, just now mentioned by me, some of
            the jewels of gold which we had obtained by barter. Now everything that was done by the
            Royal Council of the Indies was done by the orders of these gentlemen, and that which
            Diego Velasquez wished to have arranged was, that he should be given authority to trade
            with, conquer and settle all this land which he had recently discovered, and a'hy that
            he might there- after discover. He said in his reports and letters that he had spent
            many thousands of gold dollars in the discovery. So the Chaplain, Benito Martinez, went
            to Spain and succeeded in obtaining all that he asked for, and even more, for he brought
            back a decree appointing Diego Velasquez, Adelantado of the Island of Cuba. Although
            what I have here stated was already settled, the despatches did not arrive before the
            valiant Cortes had already sailed with a fresh fleet. I n^ist leave this matter here,
            both the despatches of which Benito Martinez was the bearer, and the fleet of the
            captain Cortes, and state that while writing this story I have seen the chronicles
            written by the historian. Francisco F 66 THE ERRORS IN THE HISTORIES Lopes de GÃ³mara,
            and those of the Doctor Yllescas and of Jovio, in which they treat of the conquest of
            New Spain. I feel bound to declare that, wherever it appears to contradict the others,
            my story represents events clearly and truly, and runs very diffeVently from what the
            historians I have named have written. CHAPTER XVIII. Concerning some errors and other
            things written by the Historians GÃ³mara and Yllescas about affairs in New Spain. While I
            was writing this story, I saw by chance, what had been written by GÃ³mara, Yllescas and
            Jovio, about the conquest of Mexico and New Spain, and when I had read their accounts
            and saw and appreciated their polished style, and thought how rudely and lamely my story
            was ^ told, I stopped writing it, seeing that such good histories already existed. Being
            in this perplexed state of mind, I began to look into the arguments and discourses which
            are told in these books, and I saw that from beginning to end they did not tell
            correctly what took place in New Spain. When they begin to write about the great cities,
            and the great number of the inhabitants, they are as ready to write eighty thousand as
            eight thousand. Then about the great slaughter which they say we committed : â As we
            were only four hundred and fifty soldiers who marched to that war, we had enough to do
            to defend ourselves from being killed or defeated and carried off ; and even had the
            Indians been craven cowards, we could not have committed all the slaughter attributed to
            us, more particularly as the Indians were very bold warriors who had cotton armour which
            shielded their bodies, and were armed with bows, arrows, shields, long lances, and
            two-handled stone- edged swords, which cut better than oqr swords did. BY GOMARA,
            YLLESCAS AND JOVIO. 67 Nevertheless, the historians say that we made as great a
            slaughter and committed as great cruelties as did Alaric, that bravest of kings, and the
            haughty warrior Attila, on the battlefields of Catalonia. To go back to my story, they
            say that we destroyed and burnt many cities and temples, that is their Cues, and in
            saying this, they seem to think that they are giving pleasure ta those who read their
            histories, and they do not understand when they write, that the conquerors themselves,
            and the inquisitive readers, who know what really took place, could tell them clearly
            that if they write other histories in the way they have written that of New Spain, such
            history will be worthless. The amusing part of it is, that they exalt some captains, and
            belittle others, and they speak of some, who were not even present at the conquest, as
            though they were there, and they make many other statements of equal value, but there
            are so many matters about which they are ignorant, that I cannot note them all. But
            there is one thing that they say worse than all and that is that Cortes sent secret
            orders to scuttle the ships, on the contrary, it was on the distinct advice of most of
            the other soldiers and my own, that he sent to have the ships sunk without any conceal-
            ment whatever, aitd it was done so that the sailors who were in them might help to keep
            watch and make war. Indeed, in all they write, they speak with prejudice, so why should
            I go on dipping my pen to mention each item separately, it is merely wasting ink and
            paper, moreover I should say it badly, for I have got no style. Let us leave this
            discussion and get back to my theme. After having carefully examined all that I have
            said as to the nonsense that has been written about the affairs of New Spain, I
            continued writing my own story, for it is the truest politeness and the most courteous
            style to tell the truth in what one writes, and knowing this, I made up my mind to carry
            out my plan, with such embellishments F 2 68 THE AUTHOR CONTINUES HIS STORY. and
            discourses as will be seen further on, so that the conquest of New Spain may be brought
            to light and may be clearly seen in the way it ought to be seen. I wish to return to my
            story pen in hand as a good pilot carries his lead in hand at sea, looking out for
            shoals ahead, when he knows that they will be met with, so will I do in speaking of the
            errors of the historians, but t shall not mention them all, for if one had to follow
            them item by item, the trouble of discarding the rubbish would be greater than that of
            gathering in the harvest I say that upon this story of mine the historians may build up
            and give as much praise as pleases them to the valiant captain Cortes and to the sturdy
            Conquistadores. It was a great enterprise that was accomplished by our hands, and what
            historians may write about it, we, who were eye witnesses will certify when it is true,
            as we now certify to the errors, and as so much daring and zeal has been shown in
            writing falsely and with prejudice, we appreciate how holy and blessed is the truth, and
            that all that is said against it is cursed. Moreover it appears that GÃ¶mara^ was
            inspired to write with such laudation of Cortes, for we look upon it as certain that his
            palms were greased, for he dedicated his history to the present Marquis, the son of
            Cortes, insisting on his right so to dedicate and recommend it before our lord the King,
            and the members of the Royal Council of the Indies ought to have had the mistakes erased
            that are written down in his books. 1 Alonzo RemÃ³n Edition adds :-â " Not only did
            GÃ³mara write down so many mistakes and things that are not true, but he misled many
            writers and historians who since his time have written about the affairs of New Spain,
            such as the Doctor Yllescas and Pablo Jovio who copy his very words." t>LANS FOR A tHlRD
            EXJPEDITÃON. 69 CHAPTER XIX. How we came again with another fleet to the newly
            discovered lands with the valiant and energetic Don Hernando Cortes (who was afterwards
            Marques del Valle) as captain of the fleet, and the attempts that were made to prevent
            his going in command. After the return of the Captain Juan de Grijalva to Cuba, when the
            Governor Diego Velasquez understood how rich were these newly discovered lands, he
            ordered another fleet, much larger than the former one to be sent off, and he had
            already collected in the Port of Santiago, where he resided, ten ships, four of them
            were those in which we had returned with Juan de Grijalva, which had at once been
            careened, and the other six had been got together from other ports in the Island. He had
            them furnished with provisions, consisting of Cassava bread and sÃ¡ilt pork, for at that
            time there were neither sheep nor cattle in. the Island of Cuba, as it had been only
            recently settled. These provisions were only to last until we arrived at Havana, for it
            was at that port that we were to take in our stores, as was afterwards done. I must
            cease talking of this and tell about the disputes which arose over the choice of a
            captain for the expedition. There were many debates and much opposition, for some
            gentleman said that Vasco Porcallo, a near relation of the Conde de Feria, should be
            captain, but Diego Velasquez feared that he would rise against him with the fleet, for
            he was very daring ; others said that Agustin Bermudez or Antonio Velasquez Borrejo, or
            Bernadino Velasquez, kinsman of Diego Velasquez should go in command. Most of us
            soldiers who were there said that we should prefer to go again under Juan de Grijalva,
            for he was a good captain, and there was no fault to be found either with his person or
            his capacity for command. While things were going on in the way I have related, fo
            hernÃndo cortÃ­s chosbn two great favourites of Diego Velasquez named Andres de Duero,
            the Governor's Secretary, and Amador de Lares, His Majesty's accountant, secretly formed
            a partnership with a gentleman named Hernando Cortes, a native of Medellin, who held a
            grant of Indians in the Island. A short while before, Cortes had married a lady named
            Catalina Juarez la Marcayda ; this lac^j^k was sister of a certain Juan Juarez who after
            the conquest of New Spain was a settler at Mexico. As far as I know, and from what
            others say, it was a love match. On this matter of the marriage other persons who saw it
            have had much to say, and for that reason I will not touch any more on this delicate
            subject. I will go on to tell about this partnership, it came about in this manner: â
            These two great favourites of Velasquez agreed that they would get him to appoint Cortes
            Captain General of the whole fleet, and that they would divide between the three of
            them, the spoil of gold, silver and jewels which might fall to Cortes* share. For
            secretly Diego Velasquez was sending to trade and not to form a settlement, as was
            apparent afterwards from the instruc- tions given about it, although it was announced
            and published that the expedition was for the purpose of founding a settlement. When
            this arrangement had been made, Duero and the accountant went to work in such a way with
            Diego Velasquez, and addressed such honied words to him, praising Cortes highly, as the
            very man for the position of Captain, as in addition to being energetic he knew how to
            command and ensure respect, and as one who would be faithful in everything entrusted to
            him, both in regard to the fleet and in everything else, (pointing out too, that he was
            his godson, for Velasquez was his sponsor when Cortes married Dofia Catalina Juarez),
            that they persuaded him to choose Cortes as Captain General TO LEAD TÃtE NEW ÃXPEblTION.
            ^l Andres de Duero, the Governor's Secretary, drew up the documents in very good ink^ as
            the proverb says, in %the way Cortes wished with very ample powers. When the appointment
            was made public, some persons were pleased and others annoyed. One Sunday when Diego
            Velasquez went to Mass, â and as he was Gof^nor he was accompanied by the most
            distinguished persons in the town, â he placed Hernando Cortes on his right hand so as
            to pay him honour. A buffoon, called the mad Cervantes, ran in front of Diego Velasquez,
            making grimaces and cracking jokes and he cried out â "The parade of my friend Diego,
            Diego, " Who then is this captain of your choice ? '* He comes from Medellin in
            Estramadura " A very valiant captain indeed " Have a care lest he run off with the fleet
            " For all judge him a man to take care of his own." And he cried out other nonsense, all
            of it somewhat malicious. And as he would go on shouting in this way, Andres de Duero
            who was walking near Diego Velasquez, gave the buffoon a cuff and said "Silence thou
            crazy drunkard, and don't be such a rogue, for we are well aware that these malicious
            sayings, passed off as wit, are not made up by thee," and still the madman ran on,
            notwithstanding the cuffs, saying, " Viva, Viva, the parade of my friend Diego and his
            daring Captain Cortes, I swear friend Diego that so as not to see thee weeping over the
            bad bargain thou hast made this day, I wish to go with Cortes to these rich lands."
            There is no doubt that some kinsman of the Governor had given gold pieces to the buffoon
            to utter these malicious sayings, passing them off as witty. However, this all came
            true, and it is said that madmen do sometimes hit the mark in their speeches. ^ De muy

            Cortes was chosen to exalt our holy faith and to serve his Majesty, as I will tell later
            on. Before going any further I wish to say that the valiant and energetic Hernando
            Cortes was a gentleman by birth (hijo-d'algo) by four lines of descent. The first
            through the CortÃ©ses, for so his father Martin Cortes was named, the second through the
            Pizarros, the third through the Monroys and the fourth through the Altamiranos. Al-
            though he was such a valiant, energetic and daring captain, I will not from now on, call
            him by any of these epithets of valiant, or energetic, nor will I speak of him as
            Marques del Valle, but simply as Hernando Cortes. For the name Cortes alone was held in
            as high respect throughout the Indies as well as in Spain, as was the name of Alexander
            in Macedonia, and those of Julius Caesar and Pompey and Scipio among the Romans, and
            Hannibal among the Carthaginians, or in our own Castille the name of Gonzalo Hernandez,
            the Great Captain. And the valiant Cortes himself was better pleased not to be called by
            lofty titles but simply by his name, and so I will call him for the future. And now I
            must cease talking of this, and relate in the next chapter what he undertook and
            accomplished about the preparation of his fleet. CHAPTER XX. How Cortes prepared and
            continued the arrangements necessary for the dispatch of the fleet. As soon as Hernando
            Cortes had been appointed General in the way I have related, he began to search for all
            sorts of arms, guns, powder and crossbows and every kind of warlike stores which he
            could get together, and all sorts of articles to be used for barter, and other things
            necessary for the expedition. Under hernando cortÃ©s. 73 Moreover he began to adorn
            himself and be more careful of his appearance than before, and he wore a plume of
            feathers with a medal, and a gold chain, and a velvet cloak trimmed with knots of gold,
            in fact he looked like a gallant and courageous Captain. However, he had no money to
            defray the expenses I have spoken about, for at that time he was very poor and much in
            debt, although he had a good encomienda of Indians who were getting him a return from
            his gold mines, but he spent all of it on his person and on finery for his wife whom he
            had recently married, and on entertaining some guests who had come to visit him. For he
            was affable in his manner and a good talker, and he had twice been chosen Alcalde of the
            town of Santiago Baracoa where he had settled, and in that country it is esteemed a
            great honour to be chosen as Alcalde, When some merchant friends of his named Jaime
            Tria, JerÃ³nimo Tria and Pedro de Jerez saw that he had obtained this command as Captain
            General, they lent him four thousand gold dollars in coin and gave him merchandise worth
            another four thousand dollars secured on his Indians and estates. Then he ordered two
            standards and banners to be made, worked in gold with the royal arms and a cross on each
            side with a legend which said> " Comrades, let us follow the sign of the holy Cross with
            true faith, and through it we shall conquer." And he ordered a proclamation to be made
            with the sound of drums and trumpets in the name of His Majesty and by Diego Velasquez
            in the King's name, and in his own as Captain General, to the effect that whatsoever
            person might wish to go in his company to the newly discovered lands to conquer them and

            Indians after the country had been pacified, and that to do these things Diego Velasquez
            held authority from His Majesty. Although he put in the proclamation this about the
            authority of Our Lord the King, the Chaplain, Benito Martinez, had not yet arrived from
            Spain .with the Com- mission which Diego Velasquez had sent him to obtain, as I have
            already mentioned in a former chapter. When this news was known throughout Cuba, and
            Cortes had written to all his friends in the different towns begging them to get ready
            to come with him on this expedition, some of them sold their farms so as to buy arms and
            horses, others began to prepare cassava bread and to salt pork for stores, and to make
            quilted cotton armour, and they got ready what was necessary as well as they could. We
            assembled at Santiago de Cuba, whence we set out with the fleet more than three hundred
            and fifty soldiers in number. From the house of Velasquez there came Diego de OrdÃ¡s, the
            chief Mayordomo, whom Velasquez himself sent with orders to keep his eyes open and see
            that no plots were hatched in the fleet, for he was always distrustful of Cortes
            although he concealed his fears. There came also Francisco de Morla and an Escobar, whom
            we called The Page, and a Heredia, and Juan Ruano and Pedro Escudero, and Martin Ramos
            de Lares, and many others who were friends and followers of Diego Velasquez ; and I
            place myself last on the list for I also came from the house of Diego Velasquez, for he
            was my kinsman. I have put down here the names of these soldiers from memory, later on,
            at the proper time and place I will record all those who went in the fleet whose names I
            can call to mind, and say from what part of Spain they came. ÃÃÃÃpER HÃRÃÃANDO CORTÃS.
            7Ã CortÃ©s worked hard to get his fleet under way and hastened on his preparations, for
            already envy and malice had taken possession of the relations of Diego Velasquez who
            were affronted because their kinsman neither trusted them nor took any notice of them
            and because he had given charge and command to Cortes, knowing that he had looked upon
            him as a great enemy only a short time before, on account of his marriage, already
            mentioned by me ; so they went about grumbling at their kinsman Diego Velasquez and at
            Cortes, and by every means in their power they worked on Diego Velasquez to induce him
            to revoke the commission. Now Cortes was advised of all this, and for that reason never
            left the Governor's side, and always showed himself to be his zealous servant, and kept
            on telling him that, God willing, he was going to make him a very illustrious and
            wealthy gentleman in a very short time. Moreover Andres de Duero was always advising
            Cortes to hasten the embarkation of himself and his soldiers, for Diego Velasquez was
            already changing his mind owing to the importunity of his family. When Cortes knew this
            he sent orders to his wife that all provisions of food which he wished to take and any
            other gifts (such as women usually give to their husbands when starting on such an
            expedition) should be sent at once and placed on board ship. He had already had a
            proclamation made that on that day by nightfall all ships. Captains, pilots and soldiers
            should be on board and no one should remain on shore. When Cortes had seen all his
            company embarked he went to take leave of Diego Velasquez, accompanied by his great
            friends and many other gentlemen, and all the most distinguished citizens of that town.
            After many demonstrations and embraces of Cortes by the Governor, and of the Governor by
            Cortes, he took his ;6 THE FLEET SAILS FROM SANTIAGO DE CUBA, leave. The next day very
            early after having heard Mass we went to our ships, and Diego Velasquez himself
            accompanied us, and again they embraced with many fair speeches one to the other until
            we set sail. A few days later, in fine weather, we reached the Port of Trinidad where we
            brought up in the harbour and went ashore, and nearly all the citizens of that town came
            out to meet us ; and entertained us well. Here in this story will be seen all the
            opposition which Cortes met with, and how what happened differed entirely from the
            account given by GÃ¶mara in his history. Note. â This account differs very considerably
            from that given by Las Casas (Lib. Ill, cap. cxv). It appears that Diego Velasquez had
            already determined to take the command from Cortes, *' at once on the very night that he
            became aware of what was going on, as soon ' as Diego Velasquez was in bed, and all
            those who belonged to [him,] Cortes, had left the Palace, he went in the profound
            silence of the night in the utmost haste to awaken the rest of his friends telling them
            that it was advisable to embark at once. Taking with him a company sufficient to defend
            his person, he immediately went off to the slaughter house and, although it troubled the
            contractor who had to supply the whole town with meat, he took it all away without
            leaving a single cow, pig, or sheep, and had it carried to the ships, exclaiming, but
            not out loud, for it might perhaps have cost him his life, that they could lay the blame
            on him [Cortes] for not supplying meat to the town. Then Cortes took off a small golden
            chain that he wore round his neck and gave it to the contractor or butcher, and this
            Cortes told me himself, " Cortes at once went on board ship with all the people that he
            could arouse without noise. Many of the people who had agreed to go with him and who
            really went were already on board. " When he was gone either the butcher or others who
            knew of his departure advised Diego Velasquez that Cortes was gone and was already on
            board ship. Diego Velasquez got up and mounted his horse, and all the people of the
            city, in a state of astonishment, accompanied him to the landing place by the sea at
            daybreak. When Cortes saw him he ordered a boat to be got ready with cannon, guns,
            muskets and crossbows, and all the necessary arms, and accompanied by the men he could
            trust best, with his magistrate's wand [in his hand] he came within crossbow shot of the
            land and CORTÃS AT TRINIDAD. ^^ there stopped. Diego Velasquez said to him ' How is it,
            compadre,^ that you are going off like this ? Is this the right way to take leave of
            me?' Cortes replied *Senor, may your Excellency pardon me, but these things and the like
            are done before they are thought about, I am at your Excellency's orders.' Diego
            Velasquez had nothing to say when he saw his infidelity and shamelessness. Cortes
            ordered the boat's head to be turned and went back to the ships, and ordered the sails
            to be hoisted in all haste [and] on the i8th Nov. 1518 [he set out] with very little
            food for the ships were not yet fully laden." CHAPTER XXI. What Cortes did when he
            arrived at the town of Trinidad and con- cerning the soldiers who there joined him to go
            in his company, and other things that happened. The leading inhabitants of that town
            soon provided quarters for Cortes and all of us among their neighbours. Cortes was
            lodged in the house of Captain Juan de Grijalva, and he ordered his standard and the
            Royal pennant to be set up in front of his quarters and issued a proclamation as he had
            done in Santiago, and ordered search to be made for all sorts of arms, and food and
            other necessaries to be purchased. From that town there came to join us five brothers,
            namely Pedro de Alvarado and Jorge de Alvarado, and Gonzalo and Gomez, and Juan de
            Alvarado the elder, who was a bastard. The Captain Pedro de Alvarado has often been
            mentioned by me already. There also joined us from this town Alonzo de Avila, who went
            as a Captain in Grijalva's expedition, and Juan de Escalante and Pedro Sanchez Farfan,
            and Gonzalo Mejia who later on became treasurer in Mexico, and a certain Baena and
            Juanes of Fuenterrabia, and Lares, the good horseman, so called because there was
            another Lares, and Cristobal de Olid, the Valiant, who was Maestro de Campo during the ^

            Musician, and Caspar Sanchez, nephew of the treasurer of Cuba, and Diego de Pineda or
            Pinedo, and Alonzo Rodriguez, who owned some rich gold mines, and BartolomÃ© Garcia and
            other gentlemen whose names I do not remember, all persons of quality. From Trinidad
            Cortes wrote to the town of Santispiritus which was eighteen leagues distant, informing
            all the inhabitants that he was setting out on this expedition in His Majesty's service,
            adding fair words and inducements to attract many persons of quality who had settled in
            that town, among them Alonzo HernÃ¡ndes Puertocarrero cousin of the Count of Medelh'n,
            and Gonzalo de Sandoval who became later on, in Mexico, Alguazil Mayor} and for eight
            months was Governor of New Spain and Juan Velasquez de Leon came, a kinsman of Diego
            Velasquez, and Rodrigo Reogel, and Gonzalo Lopes de Jimena, and his brother, and Juan
            Sedefto also came. This Juan Sedefto was a settler in the town, I mention this because
            we had two others of the name Juan Sedefto in the fleet All these distinguished persons
            whom I have named came from the town of Santi- spiritus to Trinidad where Cortes was
            staying, and when he heard that they were coming he went out to meet them with all the
            soldiers of his company and received them with great cordiality and they treated him
            with the highest respect. All these settlers whom I have named possessed farms near the
            town where they made Cassava bread and kept herds of swine, and each one endeavoured to
            contribute as much food as he could. We continued to enlist soldiers and to buy horses,
            which at that time were both scarce and costly, and as that gentleman already mentioned
            by me, Alonzo HernÃ¡ndes 1 Chief Constable. JOIN THE EXPEDITION. 79 Puertocarrero,
            neither possessed a horse nor the where- withal to buy one, Hernando Cortes bought him a
            gray mare, and paid for it with some of the golden knots off the velvet cloak which as I
            have said he had had made at Santiago de Cuba. At that very time a ship arrived in port
            from Havana, which a certain Juan Sedefto, a settler at Havana, was â¢taking, freighted
            with Cassava bread and salt pork to sell at some gold mines near Santiago de Cuba. Juan
            Sedefto landed and went to pay his respects to Cortes, and after a long conversation
            Cortes bought the ship and the pork and bread on credit, and it all came with us. So we
            already had eleven ships and thank God all was going well with us. Meanwhile Diego
            Velasquez had sent letters and com- mands for the fleet to be detained and Cortes to be
            sent to him as a prisoner. CHAPTER XXH. How the Governor Diego Velasquez sent two of his
            servants post haste to the town of Trinidad with orders and authority to cancel the
            appointment of Cortes, detain the fleet, arrest Cortes and send him as a prisoner to
            Santiago. I MUST go back a little from our story, to say that after we had set out from
            Santiago de Cuba with all the ships, in the way I have already related, so many things
            were said to Diego Velasquez against Cortes, that he was forced to change his mind, for
            they told him that Cortes was already in rebellion, and that he left the port by
            stealth, and that he had been heard to say that although Diego Velasquez and his
            relations might regret it, he intended to be Captain and that was the reason why he had
            embarked 80 DIEGO VELASQUEZ ATTEMPTS all his soldiers by night, so that if any attempt
            were made to detain him by force he might set sail ; they also said that Andres de
            Duero, the Secretary, and the Accountant Amador de Lares had deceived Diego Velasquez on
            account of arrangements made between them and Cortes. Those who took the leading part in
            persuading Diego Velasquez to revoke the authority he had given to Cortes were some
            members of the Velasquez family and an old man named Juan Millan whom some called the
            astrologer, but others said he had a touch of madness because he acted without
            reflection, and this old man kept repeating to Diego VelÃ¡sques " Take care, Sir, for
            Cortes will take vengeance on you for putting him in prison,* and as he Is sly and
            determined he will ruin you' if you do not prevent it at once." And Velasquez listened
            to these speeches, and was always haunted by suspicions, so without delay he sent two
            messengers whom he trusted, with orders and instruc- tions to Francisco Verdugo, the
            Chief Alcalde of Trinidad, who was his brother-in-law, and wrote letters to other
            friends and relations, to the effect that on no account should the fleet be allowed to
            sail, and he said in his orders that Cortes should be detained or taken prisoner as he
            was no longer its captain, for he had revoked his commission and given it to Vasco
            Porcallo. The messengers also carried letters to Diego de OrdÃ¡s and Francisco de Morla
            and other dependents of his begging them not to allow the fleet to sail. When Cortes
            heard of this, he spoke to OrdÃ¡s and Francisco Verdugo and to all the soldiers and
            settlers at Trinidad, whom he thought would be against him and in favour of the
            instructions, and he made such speeches and ^ This refers to an earlier incident in the
            relations between CortÃ©$ and Dien^o Velasquez. TO DEPRIVE CORTÃ¡S OF THE COMMAND. 8 1
            promises to them that he brought them over to his side. Diego OrdÃ¡s himself spoke at
            once to Francisco Verdugo, the Alcalde Mayor advising him to have nothing to do with the
            affair but to hush it up, and bade him note that up to that time they had seen no change
            in Cortes, on the contrary that he showed himself to be a faithful servant of the
            Governor, and that if Velasquez wished to impute any evil to him in order to deprive him
            of the command of the fleet, it was as well to remember that Cortes had many men of
            quality among his friends, who were unfriendly to Velasquez because he had not given
            them good grants of Indians. In addition to this, that Cortes had a large body of
            soldiers with him and was very powerful and might sow strife in the town, and perhaps
            the soldiers might sack the town and plunder it, and do even worse damage. So the matter
            was quietly dropped and one of the messengers who brought the letters and instructions,
            named Pedro Lazo de la Vega joined our company, and by the other messenger Cortes sent a
            letter to Diego Velasquez written in a very friendly manner, saying that he was amazed
            at His Honour having come to such a decision, that his desire was to serve God and his
            Majesty, and to obey him as His Majesty's representative, and that he prayed him not to
            pay any more attention to what was said by the gentlemen of his family, nor to change
            his mind on account of the speeches of such an old lunatic as Juan Millan. He also wrote
            to all his friends and especially to his partners Duero and the Treasurer. When these
            letters had been written Cortes ordered all the soldiers to polish up their arms, and he
            ordered the blacksmiths in the town to make head pieces, and the cross bowmen to
            overhaul their stores and make arrows, and he also sent for the two blacksmiths and
            persuaded them to accompany us, which they did. We were ten days G 82 THE VOYAGE ALONG
            THE SOUTH COAST OF CUBA. in that town. Here I will leave off and go on to tell how we
            embarked for Havana. However, I wish first to point out to my readers how different this
            is from the story of Francisco GÃ³mara who says that Diego Velasquez sent to OrdÃ¡s
            telling him to invite Cortes to dinner on board a ship, and then to carry him off as a
            prisoner to Santiago, and makes other state- ments calculated to mislead in his history,
            but, so as not to become prolix, I will leave them to the judgment of interested
            readers. CHAPTER XXIII. How the Captain Hernando Cortes with all the soldiers sailed
            along the south coast to the port of Havana,^ and how another ship was sent along the
            north coast to the same port, and what else took place. When Cortes saw that there was
            nothing more to be done at the town of Trinidad he summoned all the soldiers who had
            assembled there to go with him * * â¦ * * (Pedro) de Alvarado that he should go by land
            to Havana^ Â» Â« Â» Â» Â» to pick up some soldiers who lived on farms along the road, and I
            went in his company. Cortes also sent a gentleman named Juan de Escalante, a great
            friend of his, in a ship along the north coast, and he sent all the horses by land. When
            ^ This was on the south coast, not the present port of Havana on the north coast, which
            must have been about thirty miles distant. Cortes and his fleet sailed along the south
            coast of Cuba, and the " San Sebastian '' and the vessel commanded by Juan de Escalante
            were the only vessels on the north side of the Island. * The Alonzo RemÃ³n edition says "
            he summoned all the gentle- men and soldiers who had assembled there to go with him
            either to embark on the ships which were in port on the south coast, or if they
            preferred it to go by land to Havana with Pedro de Alvarado who was going to pick up
            some soldiers who lived on farms along the road." THE FLAGSHIP RUNS AGROUND. 83 all this
            had been done Cortes went on board the flagship to set sail with all the fleet for
            Havana. It appears that the ships of the Convoy did not see the flagship in which Cortes
            had embarked, for it was night time and they went on to the port [of Havana]. We also
            arrived by land at the town of Havana with Pedro de Alvarado, and the ship in which Juan
            de Escalante had come along the north coast had already arrived, and all the horses
            which had been sent by land, but Cortes did not appear, and no one knew where he was
            delayed. Five days passed without news of his ship and we began to wonder whether he had
            been lost on the JardinÃ©s^ ten or twelve miles from Havana near the Isle of Pines where
            there are many shallows. We all agfreed that three of the smaller vessels should go in
            search of Cortes, and in pre- paring the vessels and in debates whether this or the
            other man â Pedro or Sancho â should go, two more days went by and Cortes did not
            appear. Then parties began to be formed, and we all played the game of " Who shall be
            Captain until Cortes comes?" And the man who took the lead in this was Diego de OrdÃ¡s,
            as the chief Mayor- domo of Velasquez, who had been sent by the Governor merely to look
            after the fleet and see that there should be no mutiny. Let us leave this subject and
            return to Cortes who, as I have already said, had embarked on the largest ship of the
            fleet, and in the neighbourhood of the Isle of Pines, or near the JardineSy where there
            are many shallows, the ship ran aground and remained there hard and fast and could not
            be floated. Cortes ordered all the cargo which could be removed to be taken ashore in
            the boat, for there was land near by where it could be stored, and when it was seen that
            the ship was floating and could be moved, she was taken into deeper water and was laden
            again with the cargo which G 2 84 CORTES REACHES THE PORT OF HAVANA had been taken
            ashore, sail was then set and the voyage continued to the port of Havana. When Cortes
            arrived nearly all of us gentlemen and soldiers who were awaiting him were delighted at
            his coming, all except some who had hoped to be Captains, for the game of choosing
            captains came to an end. As soon as we had lodged Cortes in the house of Pedro Barba,
            who was the lieutenant of Diego Velasquez in that town, he ordered the standards to be
            brought out and placed in front of the buildings in which he was lodged and ordered
            proclamation to be made, as he had done before. From the Havana there came the Hidalgo
            Francisco Montejo very often mentioned by me, who after the con- quest of Mexico was
            appointed Governor and Adelantado of Yucatan, and there also came Diego de Soto of Toro
            who was Mayordomo to Cortes in Mexico, and a certain Angulo y Garcicaro, and Sebastian
            Rodriguez and a Pacheco and a somebody Gutierrez, and a RÃ³jas (not RÃ³jas el Rico) and a
            youth named Santa Clara, and two brothers called the Martinez del Freginal, and a Juan
            de Najara (I don't mean the deaf one who played Pelota^ in Mexico), all persons of
            quality, not counting other soldiers whose names I cannot remember. When Cortes beheld
            all these Hidalgos collected together he was greatly pleased. He sent a ship to the Cape
            of Guaniguanico, to an Indian town there, where they made Cassava bread and kept many
            pigs, to have her laden with salt pork, for the farm belonged to the Governor Diego
            Velasquez,^ and he sent Diego de OrdÃ¡s ' A ball game. * In a conversation with Las Casas
            in the year 1542, Cortes, speaking of this expedition, laughingly remarked, " A mi fÃ©,
            anduve por alii como un gentil corsario." " By my faith 1 went about there like an
            excellent robber." (Las Casas, HisL de Indias, Lib. Ill, cap. cxvi). AND PREPARES TO
            LEAVE CUBA. 85 who was the chief Mayordomo of the property of Velasquez in command of
            the ship, as he wished to get him out of the way, for he knew that Diego de OrdÃ¡s did
            not show himself to be very well disposed towards him at the time when his ship went
            ashore near the Isle of Pines and the question arose as to who should be chosen captain.
            So in order to avoid disputes with him he sent Diego de OrdÃ¡s off with orders that after
            freighting the ship with supplies of food, he should remain at the port of Guaniguanico
            until he was joined by the other ship which was going along the north coast, and then
            that the two should sail together for Cozumel, but that [in case of any change of plans]
            he would send Indians in canoes to advise him what was to be done. I must not forget to
            say that Francisco de Montejo and all the other settlers at Havana sent on board great
            stores of Cassava bread and salt pork, for other provisions were not to be had. Cortes
            now ordered all the artillery, which consisted of ten brass guns and some falconets, to
            be brought out of the ships, and gave them in charge of an artilleryman named Mesa, and
            of a levantine named Arbenga, and a certain Juan Catalan, with orders to have them
            thoroughly cleaned and tested, and to see that the balls and powder were in readiness,
            and he gave them wine and vinegar with which to clean them. He gave the gunners as a
            companion a certain BartolomÃ© de Usagre. He also ordered that the crossbows with their
            cords, nuts, and other necessaries should be overhauled, and that they should be tested
            at a target, so as to see how far each of them would carry. As in the country round
            Havana there is much cotton, we made well padded armour for ourselves, which is most
            necessary when fighting Indians, on account of the great use they make of darts, arrows
            and lances, and stones which fall on one like hail 86 CORTÃS ORGANIZES HIS HOUSEHOLD. It
            was here in Havana that Cortes began to organize a household and to be treated as a
            Lord. The first Marshal of the household/ whom he appointed was a certain Guzman who
            soon afterwards died or was killed by the Indians (this was not Cristobal de Guzman, the
            Mayordomo of Cortes who took Guatemoc* prisoner during the war in Mexico) and he had as
            camarer Rodrigo Ranguel, and for Mayordomo, Juan de CÃ¡ceres who became a rich man after
            the conquest of Mexico. When all this was settled we got ready to embark and the horses
            were divided among all the ships, and mangers were made for them and a store of maize
            and hay put on board. I will now call to mind all the mares and horses that were shipped
            : â The Captain Cortes : â A vicious dark chestnut horse, which died as soon as we
            arrived at San Juan de UlÃºa. Pedro de Alvarado and Hernando Lopez de Avila : â a very
            good sorrel mare, good both for sport and as a charger. When we arrived at New Spain
            Pedro de Alvarado bought the other half share in the mare or took it by force. Alonzo
            Hernandez Puertocarrero : â a grey mare, a very good charger which Cortes bought for him
            with his gold buttons. Juan Velasquez de Leon : â A very powerful gray mare which we
            called " La Rabona,'** very handy and a good charger. CristÃ³val de Olid : â a dark
            chestnut horse, fairly good. Francisco de Montejo and Alonzo de Avila : â a parched
            sorrel horse, no use for warfare. A LIST OF THE HORSES. 8/ Francisco de Morla : â a dark
            chestnut horse, very fast and very easily handled. Juan de Escalante : â a light
            chestnut horse with three white stockings, not much good. Diego de OrdÃ¡s, a gfray mare,
            barren, tolerably good, but not fast. Gonzalo Dominguez : â a wonderfully good horseman
            ; a very good dark chestnut horse, a grand galloper. Pedro Gonzalez de Trujillo : â sl
            good chestnut horse, all chestnut, a very good goer. Moron, a settler at Bayamo: â a
            dappled horse with stockings on the forefeet, very handy. Baena : a settler at Trinidad
            : â a dappled horse almost black, no good for anything. Lares, a very good horseman : â
            an excellent horse of rather light chestnut colour, a very good goer. Ortiz the musician
            and BartolomÃ© Garcia, who once owned gold mines : â a very good dark horse called "El
            Arriero,"^ this was one of the best horses carried in the fleet. Juan Sedefto, a settler
            at Havana : â a chestnut mare which foaled on board ship. This Juan Sedefto passed for
            the richest soldier in the fleet, for he came in his own ship with the mare, and a negro
            and a store of cassava bread and salt pork, and at that time horses and negroes were
            worth their weight in gold, and that is the reason why more horses were not taken, for
            there were none to be bought. I will leave off" here and tell what next happened to us,
            when we were just about to embark. * Ei arriero =Â« the muleteer, carrier. 88 DIEGO
            velAsquez again attempts CHAPTER XXIV. How Diego Velasquez sent a servant named Caspar
            de Gamica with orders and instructions that in any case Cortes should be arrested and
            the fleet taken from him, and what was done about it. To make my story clear, I must go
            back and relate that when Diego Velasquez knew for certain that his lieutenant and
            brother-in-law Francisco Verdugo who was stationed at the town of Trinidad not only
            refused to compel Cortes to leave the fleet, but, together with Diego de OrdÃ¡s, had
            helped him to get away, they say that he was so angry that he roared with rage and told
            his secretary Andres de Duero and the Treasurer Amador de Lares that they had deceived
            him by the agreement they had made, and that Cortes was mutinous. He made up his mind to
            send a servant with letters and prders to Pedro Barba, his lieu- tenant at Havana, and
            wrote very graciously to all his friends who were settlers in that town, and to Diego de
            OrdÃ¡s and to Juan Velasquez de Leon who were his friends and kinsmen praying them
            neither for good nor ill to let the fleet get away, and to seize Cortes at once and send
            him under a strong guard to Santiago de Cuba. On the arrival of Garnica (that was the
            name of the man who brought the letters and orders to Havana) it was known at once what
            he had brought with him, for by the same messenger Cortes was advised of what Velasquez
            was doing. It happened in this way ; â it appears that a friar of the Order of Mercy,
            who gave himself out to be a follower of Velasquez, was in the Governor's company at the
            time, and he wrote a letter to another friar of his order named BartolomÃ© del Olmedo,
            who was with us, and in that letter, written by the friar, Cortes was informed by his
            two associates, Andres de Duero and the treasurer of all that had happened. TO PREVENT
            THE FLEET FROM SAILING. 89 To go back to my story : â As Cortes had sent away Diego de
            OrdÃ¡s in a ship to collect stores, there was no one to oppose him except Juan Velasquez
            de Leon, and as soon as Cortes spoke to him he brought him over to his side, â all the
            more easily because Juan Velasquez was put out with his kinsman for not giving him a
            good grant of Indians. Not one of the others to whom Diego Velasquez had written
            favoured his proposal, indeed one and all declared for Cortes, the lieutenant Pedro
            Barba above all. In addition to this the Alvarados, Alonzo Hernandez Puerto- carrero,
            Francisco de Montejo, CristÃ³val de Olid, Juan de Escalante, Andres de Monjaraz, and his
            brother Gregorio de Monjaraz and all of us would have given our lives for Cortes. So
            that if in the Town of Trinidad the orders of Velasquez were slighted, in the town of
            Havana they were absolutely ignored. By this same Garnica, the lieutenant Pedro Barba
            wrote to Diego Velasquez that he did not dare to seize Cortes as he was too strongly
            supported by soldiers, and he was afraid lest Cortes should sack and plunder the town
            and carry off all the settlers along with 'him ; that from all that he had gathered
            Cortes was the Governor's faithful servant and would not dare to be anything else.
            Cortes also wrote to Velasquez in the agreeable and complimentary terms which he knew so
            well how to use, and told him that he should set sail next day and that he remained his
            humble servant 90 THE FLEET ARRIVES CHAPTER XXV. How Cortes set sail with all his
            company of Gentlemen and soldiers for the Island of Cozumel and what happened there.
            There was to be no parade of the forces until we arrived at Cozumel. Cortes ordered the
            horses to be taken on board ship^and he directed Pedro de Alvarado to go along the North
            coast in a good ship named the San Sebastian^ and he told the pilot who was in charge to
            wait for him at Cape San Antonio as all the ship$ would meet there and go in company to
            Cozumel. He also sent a messenger to Diego de OrdÃ¡s, who had gone along the North Coast
            to collect supplies of food with orders to do the same and await his coming. On the loth
            February 1519, after hearing Mass, they set sail along the south coast with nine ships
            and the company of gentlemen and soldiers whom I have mentioned, so that with the two
            ships absent on the north coast there were eleven ships in all, including that which
            carried Pedro de Alvarado with seventy soldiers and I travelled in his company. The
            Pilot named Camacho who was in charge of our ship paid no attention to the orders of
            Cortes and went his own way and we arrived at Cozumel two days before Cortes and
            anchored in the port which I have often mentioned when telling about Grijalva's
            expedition. Cortes had not yet arrived, being delayed by the ship commanded by Francisco
            de Morla having lost her rudder in bad weather, however she was supplied with another
            rudder by one of the ships of the fleet,^ and all then came on in company. ^ Blotted out
            in the original MS. ''They turned back looking for the rudder in the sea and they found
            it and put it in its place, so thaf they were soon able to navigate the ship."â G. G. AT
            C02UMEL. 9 1 To go back to Pedro de Alvarado. As soon as we arrived in port we went on
            shore with all the soldiers to the town of Cozumel, but we found no Indians there as
            they had all fled. So we were ordered to go on to another town about a league distant,
            and there also the natives had fled and taken to the bush, but they could not carry off
            their property and left behind their poultry and other things and Pedro de Alvarado
            ordered forty of the fowls to be taken. In an Idol house there were some altar ornaments
            made of old cloths and some little chests containing diadems, Idols, beads and pendants
            of gold of poor quality, and here we captured two Indians and an Indian woman, and we
            returned to the town where we had disembarked. While we were there Cortes arrived with
            all the fleet, and after taking up his lodging the first thing he did was to order the
            pilot Camacho to be put in irons for not having waited for him at sea as he had been
            ordered to do. When he saw the town without any people in it, and heard that Pedro de
            Alvarado had gone to the other town and had taken fowls and cloths and other things of
            small value from the Idols, and some gold which was half copper, he showed that he was
            very angry both at that and at the pilot not having waited for him, and he repri- manded
            Pedro de Alvarado severely, and told him that we should never pacify the country in that
            way by robbing the natives of their property, and he sent for the two Indians and the
            woman whom we had captured, and through Melchorejo, (Julianillo his companion was dead)
            the man we had brought from Cape Catoche who under- stood the language well, he spoke to
            them telling them to go and summon the Caciques and Indians of their town, and he told
            them not to be afraid, and he ordered the gold and the cloths and all the rest to be
            given back to them, and for the fowls (which had already been eaten) 92 CORTÃ¡S REVIEWS
            he ordered them to be given beads and little bells, and in addition he gave to each
            Indian a Spanish shirt So they went off to summon the lord of the town, and the next day
            the Cacique and all his people arrived, women and children and all the inhabitants of
            the town, and they went about among us as though they had been used to us all their
            lives, and Cortes ordered us not to annoy them in any way. Here in this Island Cortes
            began to rule energetically, and Our Lord so favoured him that what- ever he put his
            hand to it turned out well for him, especially in pacifying the people and towns of
            these lands, as we shall see further on. CHAPTER XXVI. How Cortes reviewed all his army
            and what else happened to us. When we had been in Cozumel three days Cortes ordered a
            muster of his forces so as to see how many of us there were, and he found that we
            numbered five hundred and eight, not counting the shipmasters, pilots and sailors, who
            numbered about one hundred. There were sixteen horses and mares all fit to be used for
            sport or as chargers. There were eleven ships both great and small, and one a sort of
            launch which a certain Gines Nortes brought laden with supplies. There were thirty two
            cross bowmen and thirteen musketeers ; â escopeteros, as they were then called and ^
            brass guns, and four falconets, and much powder and ball. About the number of cross
            bowmen my memory 1 Blotted out in the original MS. is the word '*ten."â G. G. HIS ARMY
            93 does not serve me very well, but it is not material to my story. After the review
            Cortes ordered Mesa surnamed "the gunner" and BartolomÃ© de Usagre and Arbenga and a
            certain Catalan who were all artillerymen, to keep their guns clean and in good order,
            and the ammunition ready for use. He appointed Francisco de Orozco, who had been a
            soldier in Italy to be captain of the Artillery. He like- wise ordered two crossbowmen
            named Juan Benitez and Pedro del Guzman the crossbowman, who were masters of the art of
            repairing crossbows, to see that every crossbow had two or three [spare] nuts and cords
            and fore cords and to be careful to keep them stored and to have smoothing tools and
            inguijuelc^ and [to see] that the men should practice at a target. He also ordered all
            the horses to be kept in good condition. I don't know why I should expend so much ink in
            telling about these preparations of arms and the rest of it, for in truth Cortes was
            most vigilant about every- thing. CHAPTER XXVH. How Cortes came to know that the Indians
            of Cape Catoche held two Spaniards in captivity, and what he did about it. As Cortes was
            most diligent in all matters, he sent for me and a Biscayan named Martin Ramos, and
            asked us what we thought about those words which the Indians of Campeche had used when
            we went there with Francisco Hernandez de Cordova, when they cried out "Castilan,
            Castilan'* as I have already stated in the chapter which treats of that expedition. We
            again related to Cortes all that we had seen and heard about the matter, and he said *
            Probably some technical term now obsolete. 94 NEWS OF SPANIARDS HELD AS PRISONERS. that
            he also had often thought about it, and that perhaps there might be some Spaniards
            living in the country, and added " It seems to me that it would be well to ask these
            Caciques of Cozumel if they know anything about them." So through Melchorejo, the man
            from Cape Catoche, who already understood a little Spanish and knew the language of
            Cozumel very well, all the chiefs were questioned, and every one of them said that they
            had known of certain Spaniards and gave descriptions of them, and said that some
            Caciques, who lived about two days' journey inland, / "" kept them as slaves, and that
            here in Cozumel were some [^ Indian traders who spoke to them only a few days ago. We
            were all delighted at this news, and Cortes told the Caciques that they must go at once
            and summon the Spaniards, taking with them letters, (which in the Indian language they
            call atnales) and he gave shirts to the Caciques and Indians who went with the letters
            and spoke reassuringly to them, and told them that when they returned he would give them
            some more beads. The Cacique advised Cortes to send a ransom to the owners who held
            these men as slaves, so that they should be allowed to come, and Cortes did so, and gave
            to the messengers all manner of beads. Then he ordered the two smallest vessels to be
            got ready (one of them was little larger than a launch) and twenty men with guns and
            crossbows, under â¢ " the command of Diego de OrdÃ¡s, and he sent them off to the coast
            near Cape Catoche where the larger vessel was to wait for eight days while the smaller
            vessel should go back- wards and forwards and bring news of what was being done, for the
            land of Cape Catoche was only four leagues distant, and the one country could be seen
            from the other. In the letter Cortes said : â " Gentlemen and brothers, here in Cozumel
            I have learnt that you are captives in the hands of a Cacique, and I pray you that you
            come here to Cozumel at once, and for this purpose I have sent a ship JERONIMO DE
            AGUILAR AND GONZALO GUERRERO. 95 with soldiers, in case you have need of them, and a
            ransom to be paid to those Indians with whom you are living. The ship will wait eight
            days for you. Come in all haste, and you will be welcomed and protected. I am here at
            this Island with five hundred soldiers and eleven ships, in which I go on, please God,
            to a town called Tabasco or Potonchan." The two vessels were soon despatched with the
            two Indian traders from Cozumel who carried the letters, and they crossed the strait in
            three hours and the messengers with the letters and ransom were landed. In two days the
            letters were delivered to a Spaniard named JerÃ³nimo de Aguilar, for that we found to be
            his name, and so I shall call him in future. When he had read the letter and received
            the ransom of beads which we had sent to him he was delighted, and carried the ransom to
            the Cacique his master, and begged leave to depart, and the Cacique at once gave him
            leave to go wherever he pleased. Aguilar set out for the place, five leagues distant,
            where his companion Gonzalo Guerrero was living, but when he read the letter to him he
            answered, " Brother Aguilar, I am married and have three children and the Indians look
            on me as a Cacique and captain in wartime, â You go and God be with you, but I have my
            face tatooed and my ears pierced, what would the Spaniards say should they see me in
            this guise ? and look how handsome these boys of mine are, for God's sake give me those
            green beads you have brought and I will give the beads to them and say that my brothers
            have sent them from my own country." And the Indian wife of Gonzalo spoke to Aguilar in
            her own tongue very angrily and said to him, " What is this slave coming here for
            talking to my husband, â go off with you, and don't trouble us with any more words."
            Then Aguilar reminded Gonzalo that he was a Christian and said that he should not
            imperil his soul for the sake of 96 ORDÃS RETURNS WITHOUT NEWS. I I an Indian woman, and
            as for his wife and children he could take them with him if he did not wish to desert
            them But by no words or admonishments could he be persuaded to come. It appears that
            Gonzalo Guerrero was a sailor and a native of Palos. When JerÃ³nimo de Aguilar saw that
            Gonzalo would not accompany him he went at once, with the two Indian messengers, to the
            place where the ship had been awaiting ^ his coming, but when he arrived he saw no ship
            for she had t. already departed. The eight days during which OrdÃ¡s ^ had been ordered to
            await and one day more had already ' expired, and seeing that Aguilar had not arrived
            OrdÃ¡s S returned to Cozumel without bringing any news about that for which he had come.
            When Aguilar saw that there was no ship there he became very sad, and returned to his
            master and to the town where he usually lived. Now I will leave this and say that when
            Cortes saw OrdÃ¡s return without success or any news of the Spaniards or Indian
            messengers he was very angry, and said haughtily to OrdÃ¡s that he thought that he would
            have done better than to return without the Spaniards or any news of them, for it was
            quite clear that they were prisoners in that r" country. At that moment it happened that
            some sailors called the reflates,^ natives of Gibraleon,^ had stolen some pieces of salt
            pork from a soldier named Berrio and would not return them, so Berrio complained to
            Cortes and the sailors were put on oath, and they perjured themselves, but in the
            enquiry the fact of the theft was proved, and that the pork had been divided among seven
            sailors, and Cortes ordered four of them to be flogged, in spite of the appeals of some
            of the Captains. ^ Penates â rock men. ' Gibraltar. - L. A BLACK SERMON*-- 97 Here I

            oratory on Cozumel toivliich it was the custom . w|j of the people of the land to offer
            sacrifices at that season. One morning the courtyard of the oratory where the Idols were
            tept was crowded with Indians, and n:iany of them both men and wunien were burning a
            resin like our incense. J / As this was a n^ us we stood round watching it I ' with
            attention, diui ^prt^^cntly an old Indian with a long cloak, who was the priest of

            called/^hii^ent up on the top of the oratory and began to preach to tHe I people. Cortes
            and all of us were wondering what would be the result of that black sermon. Cortes asked
            Mel- Ã chorejo, who understood the language well, what the old F Indian was saying, for
            he was informed that he was preach- ing evil things, and he sent for the Cacique and all
            the p principal chiefs and the priest himself, and, as well as he f could through the
            aid of our interpreter, he told them that if we were to be brothers they must cast those
            most evil Idols out of their temple, for they were not gods at all f but very evil
            things which led them astray and could lead I their souls to hell. Then he spoke to them
            about good and holy things, and told them to set up in the place of ^ ,v their Idols an
            image of Our Lady which he gave them, and t - a cross, which would always aid them and
            bring good f harvests and would save their souls, and he told them in a very excellent
            way other things about our holy faith. The Priest and the Caciques answered that their
            fore- fathers had worshipped those Idols because they were good, and that they did not
            dare to do otherwise, and that H U, f 98 COMMANDERS APPOINTED. if we cast out their
            Idols we would see how much harm it would do us, for we should be lost at sea. Then
            Cortes ordered us to break the Idols to pieces and roll them down the steps,^ and this
            we did ; then he ordered lime to be brought, of which there was a good store in the
            town, and Indian masons, and he set up a very fair altar on which we placed the figure
            of Our Lady ; and he ordered two of our party named Alonzo YÃ¡nez and Alvaro Lopez who
            were carpenters and joiners to make a cross of some rough timber which was there, and it
            was placed in a small chapel near the altar and the priest named Juan Diaz said mass
            there, and the Cacique and the heathen priest and all the Indians stood watching us with
            attention. The Caciques in this Island of Cozumel are called Calachiones as I have
            already said when telling about our doings at Potonchan. Now I will leave off here, and
            will go on to tell how we embarked on board ship. CHAPTER XXVIII. How Cortes allotted
            the ships and appointed captains to go in them, and gave instructions to the pilots and
            arranged lantern signals for the night time, and what else happened to us. Cortes
            himself took command of the flagship, Pedro de Alvarado and his brothers took charge of
            the San Sebastian^ a very good ship, and the commands of the other ships were given to
            Alonso Hernandez Puertocarrero, Francisco de Montejo, who had a good ship, CristÃ³val de
            Olid, Diego de OrdÃ¡s, Juan Velasquez de Leon, Juan de Escalante, 1 In the " Itinerary of
            Grijalva" a temple or oratory of the Idols is thus described : â " It was eighteen steps
            (of a stairway) in height and the base was solid, and the measurement round it was ona
            hundred and eighty feet. On the top of this was a small tower the height of two men one
            above the other and inside were certain figures and bones and Cents which are the Idols
            which they worship." THE FLEET RETURNS TO COZUMEL. 99 Francisco de Moria, the Page
            Escobar, and the smallest vessel of all, a launch, was commanded by Gines Nortes. Each
            ship had its pilot; Anton de.Alaminos was Pilot in Chief, and instructions were given
            about the course to be steered and other matters, and about the lantern signals for the
            night time. Cortes took leave of the Caciques and priests and con- fided to their care
            the Image of Our Lady and told them to reverence the cross and keep it clean and
            wreathed with flowers and they would see what advantage they would gain by so doing, and
            the Indians replied that they would do so, and they brought four fowls and two jars of
            honey and they embraced him. We embarked and set sail on a day in the Month of March 15
            19, and went on our way in fair weather. At ten o'clock that same morning loud shouts
            were given from one of the ships, which tried to lay to, and fired a shot so that all
            the vessels of the fleet might hear it, and when Cortes heard this he at once checked
            the flagship and seeing the ship commanded by Juan de Escalante bearing away and
            returning towards Cozumel, he cried out to the other ships which were near him "What is
            the matter? What is the matter?** And a soldier named Luis de Zaragoza answered that
            Juan de Escalante's ship with all the Cassava bread on board was sinking, and Cortes
            cried, " Pray God that we suffer no such disaster," and he ordered the Pilot Alaminos to
            make signal to all the other ships to return to Cozumel. So this same day we returned to
            the port whence we had sailed, and sent the Cassava bread on shore, and we found the
            image of Our Lady and the Cross well cared for with incense burning in front of it, and
            this pleased us greatly. The Cacique and priests came to speak to Cortes and asked why
            we had returned, and he replied, because one of the ships was leaking and we wished to
            caulk her, and he asked them to H 2 100 THE ARRIVAL OF come in their canoes and help the
            ships boats to bring the Cassava bread on shore, and this they did. We were four days
            repairing the ship. Now I will stop writing about this, and will relate how the Spaniard
            named Aguilar who was a prisoner among the Indians heard of our return, and what else
            happened. CHAPTER XXIX. How the Spaniard named JerÃ³nimo de Aguilar, who was a prisoner
            among the Indians, heard that we had returned to Cozumel and came to us, and what else
            took place. When the Spaniard who was a prisoner among the Indians, knew for certain
            that we had returned to Cozumel with the ships, he was very joyful and gave thanks to
            God, and he came in all haste with the two Indians who had carried the letters and
            ransom, and embarked in a canoe, and as he was able to pay well with the green beads we
            had sent him, he soon hired a canoe and six Indian rowers, and they rowed so fast that,
            meeting no head wind, in a very short time they crossed the strait between the two
            shores, which is a distance of about four leagues. When they arrived on the coast of
            Cozumel and were disembarking, some soldiers who had gone out hunting (for there were
            wild pigs on the island) told Cortes that a large canoe, which had come from the
            direction of Cape Catoche, had arrived near the town. Cortes sent Andres de TÃ¡pia and
            two other soldiers to go and see, for it was a new thing for Indians to come fearlessly
            in large canoes into our neighbourhood. So they set out, and as soon as the Indians who
            came in the canoe which Aguilar had hired caught sight of the Spaniards, they were
            frightened and wished to get back into the canoe and flee away. Aguilar told th^m in
            th^ir own language not to be afraid, JERONIMO DE AGUILAk. tÃ¶i that these men were his
            brothers. When Andres de TÃ¡pia saw that they were only Indians (for Aguilar looked
            neither more nor less than an Indian), he at once sent word to Cortes by a Spaniard that
            they were Cozumel Indians who had come in the canoe. As soon as the men had landed, the
            Spaniard in words badly articulated and worse pronounced, cried Dios y Santa Maria de
            Sevilla^ and TÃ¡pia went at once to embrace him. The other soldier who had accompanied
            TÃ¡pia when he saw what had happened, promptly ran to Cortes to beg a reward for the good
            news, for it was a Spaniard who had come in the canoe, and we were all delighted when we
            heard it TÃ¡pia soon brought the Spaniard to Cortes, but before he arrived where Cortes
            was standing, several Spaniards asked TÃ¡pia where the Spaniard was? although he was
            walking by his side, for they could not distinguish him from an Indian as he was
            naturally brown and he had his hair shorn like an Indian slave, and carried a paddle on
            his shoulder, he was shod with one old sandal and the other was tied to his belt, he had
            on a ragged old cloak, and a worse loin cloth with which he covered his naked- ness, and
            he had tied up, in a bundle in his cloak, a Book of Hours, old and worn. When Cortes saw
            him in this state, he too was deceived like the other soldiers, and asked TÃ¡pia " Where
            is the Spaniard ?" On hearing this, the Spaniard squatted down on his haunches as the
            Indians do and said " I am he." Cortes at once ordered him to be given a shirt and
            doublet and drawers and a cape and sandals, for he had no other clothes, and asked him
            about, himself and what his name was and when he came to this country. The man replied,
            pronouncing with difficulty, that he was called JerÃ³nimo de Aguilar, a native of Ecija,
            and that he had taken holy orders, that eight years had passed since he and fifteen
            other men and two women left Darien for the Island of Santo Domingo, where he had I02
            THE ARRIVAL OF some disputes and a law-suit with a certain Enciso y Valdivia, and he
            said that they were carrying ten thousand gold dollars and the legal documents of the
            case, and that the ship in which they sailed, struck on the Alacranes so that she could
            not be floated, and that he and his com- panions and the two women got into the ship's
            boat, thinking to reach the Island of Cuba or Jamaica, but that the currents were very
            strong and carried them to this land, and that the Calachiones of that district had
            divided them among themselves, and that many of his companions had been sacrificed to
            the Idols, and that others had died of disease, and the women had died of overwork only
            a short time before, for they had been made to grind corn ; that the Indians had
            intended him for a sacrifice, but that one night he escaped and fled to the Cacique with
            whom since then he had been living (I don't remember the name that he gave) and that
            none were left of all his party except himself and a certain Gonzalo Guerrero, whom he
            had gone to summon, but he would not come. When Cortes heard all this, he gave thanks to
            God, and said that he would have him well looked after and rewarded. He questioned
            Aguilar about the country and the towns, but Aguilar replied that having been a slave,
            he knew only about hewing wood and drawing water and digging in the fields, that he had
            only once travelled as far as four leagues from home when he was sent with a load, but,
            as it was heavier than he could carry, he fell ill, but that he understood that there
            were very many towns. When questioned about Gonzalo Guerrero, he said that he was
            married and had three sons, and that his face was tattooed and his ears and lower lip
            were pierced, that he was a seaman and a native of Palos, and that the Indians
            considered him to be very valiant ; that when a little more than a year s^o a captain
            and three vessels arrived at Cape Catoche, (it seems probable that this was when we
            JERONIMO DE AGUILAR. IO3 came with Francisco Hernandez de Cordova) it was at the
            suggestion of Guerrero that the Indians attacked them, and that he was there himself in
            the company of the Cacique of the large town, whom I have spoken about when describing
            the expedition of Francisco Hernandez de Cordova. When Cortes heard this he exclaimed "
            I wish I had him in my hands for it will never do to leave him here." When the Caciques
            of Cozumel found out that Aguilar could speak their language, they gave him to eat of
            their best, and Aguilar advised them always to respect and revere the holy image of Our
            Lady and the Cross, for they would find that it would benefit them greatly. On the
            advice of Aguilar the Caciques asked Cortes to give them a letter of recommendation, so
            that if any other Spaniards came to that port they would treat the Indians well and do
            them no harm, and this letter was given to them. After bidding the people good-bye with
            many caresses and promises we set sail for the Rio de Gri- jalva. This is the true story
            of Aguilar, and not the other which the historian GÃ³mara has written ; however, I am not
            surprised that what he says is news to me. Now I must go on with my story. CHAPTER XXX.
            How we again embarked and made sail for the Rio de Grijalva, and what happened to us on
            the voyage. On the 4th March 1519, with the good fortune to carry such a useful and
            faithful interpreter along with us, Cortes gave orders for us to embark in the same
            order as we 104 A VESSEL MISSING. had followed before we ran back to Cozumel, under the
            same instructions and with the same lantern signals by night We sailed along in good
            weather, until at nightfall a head wind struck us so fiercely that the ships were dis-
            persed and there was great danger of being driven ashore. Thank God, by midnight the
            weather moderated, and as soon as dawn broke the ships got together again, excepting the
            vessel under the command of Juan Velasquez de Leon. We went on our way and up to midday
            had seen nothing of the missing vessel which distressed us all as we feared she had been
            lost on a shoal. When the whole day had passed and she did not appear Cortes told the
            pilot Alaminos that it was no good going on any further without news of the missing
            ship, so the pilot made signal for all the vessels to lay to, and wait to see if by
            chance the storm had driven her into some bay whence she could not get out again against
            a head wind. However, when she still failed to appear, the pilot said to Cortes, " Sir,
            I feel certain that she put into a sort of port or bay which we have already passed, and
            that a head wind keeps her there, for the pilot on board of her is Juan Alvarez el
            Manquillo who was with Fran- cisco Hernandez de Cordova and again with Grijalva and he
            knows that port." So it was agreed that the whole fleet should go back and search for
            the missing ship, and we found her at anchor in the bay of which the pilot had spoken,
            which was a great relief to us all. We stayed in that bay for a day and we lowered two
            boats and the pilot and a Captain called Francisco de Lugo went on shore and found farms
            and maize plantations, and some places where the Indians made salt, and there were four
            Cues which are the houses of their Idols, and there were many Idols in them, nearly all
            of them figures of tall UNIVEP^'T^' * PtÃ­NTA DÃ LAS MUGÃRÃS. lÃj women so that we called
            that place the Punta de las Mugeres} I remember that Aguilar said that the town where he
            was held in slavery was near these farms and that he had come there with a load, and his
            master had taken him there, and that he fell ill on account of the weight of the load,
            and he said that the town where Gonzalo Guerrero lived was not far off, and that there
            was some gold in all the towns, but it did not amount to much; that if we liked he would
            guide us to the towns, and advised us to go there. Cortes replied, laughing, that we
            were not after such small game, but to serve God and the King. Soon afterwards Cortes
            ordered a Captain named Escobar to go in the vessel under his command, which was a fast
            sailer and drew little water, to the Boca de TÃ©rminos and to examine the place
            thoroughly and find out if it would be a good port for a settlement, and if game were
            plentiful there as he had been told it was. That after he had examined the place he
            should put up some sign and break down some trees at the mouth of the harbour, or that
            he should write a letter and place it where we could see it from either side of the
            harbour, so that we should know that he had gone in there; or that, after examining the
            port he should beat up to windward and await the fleet at sea. This order was given on
            the * Punta de las Mugeres =Â» the cape of the women. The Island which forms the bay is
            still called Isla de las Mugeres. Bemal Diaz says nothing about this locality in his
            description of the two earlier voyages, but the author of the Itinerario says that
            Grijalva observed it, after leaving Cozumel : â " We made sail and went towards the
            Island of Yucatan along the North Coast, and as we coasted along we came to a beautiful
            tower on a point, which is said to be inhabited by women who live without men. One might
            believe them to be a race of Amazons.'' As Grijalva could not possibly have had any
            information on the subject, it seems to show that the Itinerario was written at a later
            date than is usually assigned to it, and gave this explanation to account for the name
            given to the locality by Cortes. I06 ESCOBAR EXAMINES THE PUERTO DE TÃRMINOS. advice of
            the pilot, so that when we arrived at the Boca de TÃ©rminos with the fleet we should not
            be delayed by going into port. So Escobar left us and went to the Puerte de TÃ©rminos and
            did all that he was told to do, and he found the lurcher which had been left there in
            Grijalva's time, and she was fat and sleek. Escobar said that when the lurcher saw the
            ship come into port she wagged her tail and showed other signs of delight, and came at
            once to the soldiers and went with them on board the ship. After carrying out his orders
            Escobar put to sea again and awaited the fleet, and it appears that with the south wind
            that was blowing he was not able to lay to but was driven out to sea. To go back to our
            fleet ; we remained at the Punta de las Mugeres until the next day when we put to sea
            with a good breeze ofi* the land and went on until we arrived at the Boca de TÃ©rminos,
            but, as we did not meet Escobar, Cortes ordered a boat to be lowered, and with ten
            cross- bowmen went to look for him in the Boca de TÃ©rminos, or to see if there was any
            signal or letter. They soon found trees that had been cut down, and a letter in which
            Escobar said that the harbour was a good one, that the land was fertile, and that there
            was an abundance of game, and he told about the lurcher. However, the pilot Alaminos
            told Cortes that we had better keep on our course, for with the wind from the south
            Escobar â¢ must have been driven out to sea, but that he would not be far off" as he
            would lie close to the wind. But Cortes was anxious lest some accident had befallen him,
            so he ordered the sheets to be slacked away and we soon came up to Escobar who made his
            report to Cortes and told him why he could not await his coming. While this was taking
            place we arrived near Potonchan THE FLEET SAILS PAST CHANPOTON. I07 [Chanpoton] and
            Cortes ordered the Pilot to drop anchor in the bay, but the Pilot replied that it was a
            bad port, for the tide ran out so far that the ships had to be brought up more than two
            leagues from the shore. Cortes had a mind to give the Indians a lesson on account of the
            defeat they had inflicted on Francisco Hernandez de Cordova and Grijalva, and many of us
            soldiers who had been in those battles begged him to go in, and not to leave without
            giving the Indians a good chastisement, even if it did detain us two or three days. But
            the Pilot Alaminos and the other pilots contended that if we should go in it might, with
            a head wind, be eight days before we could get out again ; that we had a fair wind now
            for Tabasco and could get there in two days. So we passed on and after three days sail
            arrived at the Rio de Grijalva called in the Indian langfuage the Tabasco River, and
            what happened to us there and the attack that was made on us I will go on to relate.
            CHAPTER XXXI. How we arrived at the Rio de Grijalva, which in the language of the
            Indians is called Tabasco, of the attack the Indians made on us, and what else happened
            to us with them. On the 12th March, 15 19, we arrived with all the fleet at the Rio de
            Grijalva, which is also called Tabasco, and as we already knew from our experience with
            Grijalva that vessels of large size could not enter into the river, the larger vessels
            were anchored out at sea, and from the smaller vessels and boats all the soldiers were
            landed at the Cape of the Palms (as they were in Grijalva's time) which was about half a
            league distant from the town of lo8 THE RIO DE GRIJALVA OR DE TABASCO. Tabasco.* The
            river, the river banks and the mangrove thickets were swarming with Indians, at which
            those of us who had not been here in Grijalva's time were much astonished. In addition
            to this there were assembled in the town more than twelve thousand warriors* all
            prepared to make war on us, for at this time the town was of considerable importance and
            other large towns were subject to it and they had all made preparation for war and were
            well supplied with the arms which they are accustomed to use. The reason for this was
            that the people of Potonchan' and LÃ¡zaro and the other towns in that neighbourhood had
            looked upon the people of Tabasco as cowards, and had told them so to their faces,
            because they had given ^ The large town which the author here calls Tabasco appears
            originally to have been called Potonchan ; it was renamed by the Spaniards Santa Maria
            de la Victoria ; it was later on called Tabasco, and it soon fell into ruin and
            disappeared altogether, its place as a port being taken by Frontera on the other side of
            the river. In the Relacion de la Villa de Santa Maria de la Victoria^ 1579 {Relaciones
            de Yucatan^ vol. ii, p. 341), we find : "This river and port is at 18" 30' (N. Lat.),
            where this town was established about a league from the mouth of the river on 2iplacel*
            of water which is formed on the north side, and on a branch of the river which leads to
            a town called Taxagual, of fifteen households i^vecinos) more or less, which is three
            leagues from this town and one league away from the river. The land of this town [Santa
            Maria] is sterile because it is built on sand and swamps. This branch of the river turns
            to the south-west, andcj, into it enter swamps and lagoons, and it has many diqp places
            ' {bajos). The barques and frigates anchor in this branch of the river when they come to
            this town to load or unload at the foot of the Cross which is at the end of the street
            and the mound on which it stands." See also Note to Chapter III. In the American
            Antiquarian for September, 1896, Dr. Daniel Brinton published an article on "The Battle
            and the Ruins of Cintla," taken principally from notes made by the late Dr. C. H.
            Berendt, who visited and surveyed the ruins in March and April, 1869. * Blotted out in

            although they had more towns and more warriors than the people of Potonchan and LÃ¡zaro.
            This they said to annoy them and added that they in their towns had attacked us and
            killed fifty six of us. So on account of these taunts which had been uttered, the people
            of Tabasco had determined to take up arms. When Cortes saw them drawn up ready for war
            he told Aguilar the interpreter, who spoke the language of Tabasco well,^ to ask the
            Indians who passed near us, in a large canoe and who looked like chiefs, what they were
            so much disturbed about, and to tell them that we had not come to do them any harm, but
            were willing to give them some of the things we had brought with us and to treat them
            like brothers, and we prayed them not to begin a war as they would regret it, and much
            else was said to them about keeping the peace. How- ever, the more Aguilar talked to
            them the more violent they became, and they said that they would kill us all if we
            entered their town, and that it was fortified all round with fences and barricades of
            large trunks of trees. Aguilar spoke to them again and asked them to keep the peace, and
            allow us to take water and barter our goods with them for food, and permit us to tell
            the Calachones* things which would be to their advantage and to the service of God our
            Lord, but they still per- sisted in saying that if we advanced beyond the palm trees
            they would kill us. When Cortes saw the state of affairs he ordered the * These people
            were Tzendals, a branch of the Maya stock, and Aguilar, who spoke Maya, could understand
            and speak to them. ' Calachiones? no THE SPANIARDS LAND boats and small vessels to be
            got ready and ordered three cannon to be placed in each boat and divided the cross-
            bowmen and musketeers among the boats. We remem- bered that when we were here with
            Grijalva we had found a narrow path which ran across some streams from the palm grove to
            the town, and Cortes ordered three soldiers to find out in the night if that path ran
            right up to the houses, and not to delay in bringing the news, and these men found out
            that it did lead there. After making a thorough examination of our surroundings the rest
            of the day was spent in arranging how and in what order we were to go in the boats. The
            next morning we had our arms in readiness and after hearing mass Cortes ordered the
            Captain Alonzo de Avila and a hundred soldiers among whom were ten crossbowmen, to go by
            the little path which led to the town, and, as soon as he heard the guns fired, to
            attack the town on one side while he attacked it on the other. Cortes himself and all
            the other Captains and soldiers went in the boats and light draft vessels up the river.
            When the Indian warriors who were on the banks and among the mangroves saw that we were
            really on the move, they came after us with a great many canoes with intent to prevent
            our going ashore at the landing place, and the whole river bank appeared to be covered
            with Indian warriors carrying all the diÃ­Terent arms which they use, and blowing
            trumpets and shells and sounding drums. When Cortes saw how matters stood he ordered us
            to wait a little and not to fire any shots from guns or crossbows or cannon, for as he
            wished to be justified in all that he might do he made another appeal to the Indians
            through the interpreter Aguilar, in the presence of the King's Notary, Diego de Godoy,
            asking the Indians to allow us to land and take water and speak to them about God and
            about His Majesty, and adding that should AND ATTACK TABASCO. Ill they make war on us,
            that if in defending ourselves some should be killed and others hurt, theirs would be
            the fault and the burden and it would not lie with us, but they went on threatening that
            if we landed they would kill us. Then they boldly began to let fly arrows at us, and
            made signals with their drums, and like valiant men they surrounded us with their
            canoes, and they all attacked us with such a shower of arrows that they kept us in the
            water in some parts up to our waists. As there was much mud and swamp at that place we
            could not easily get clear of it, and so many Indians fell on us, that what with some
            hurling their lances with all their might and others shooting arrows at us, we could not
            reach the land as .soon as we wished. While Cortes was fighting he lost a shoe in the
            mud and could not find it again, and he got on shore with one foot bare. Presently
            someone picked the shoe out of the mud 1/ and he put it on again. While this was
            happening to Cortes, all of us Captains as well as soldiers, with the cry of "
            Santiago," fell upon the Indians and forced them to retreat, but they did not fall back
            far, as they sheltered themselves behind great barriers and stockades formed of thick
            logs until we pulled them apart and got to one of the small gateways of the town. There
            we attacked them again, and we pushed them along through a street to where other
            defences had been erected, and there they turned on us and met us face to face and
            fought most valiantly, making the greatest efforts, shouting and whistling and crying
            out " al calacheoni ", " al cala- cheoni ", which in their language meant an order to
            kill or capture our Captain. While we were thus surrounded by them Alonzo de Avila and
            his soldiers came up. As I have already said they came from the Palm grove by land and
            could not arrive sooner on account of the swamps and creeks. Their delay was really
            unavoidable. 112 THE INDIANS DEFEATED. just as we also had been delayed over the summons
            of the Indians to surrender, and in breaking openings in the barricades, so as to enable
            us to attack them. Now we all joined together to drive the enemy out of their strong-
            holds, and we compelled them to retreat, but like brave warriors they kept on shooting
            showers of arrows and fire-hardened darts, and never turned their backs on us until [we
            gained] a great court with chambers and large halls, and three Idol houses, where they
            had already carried all the goods they possessed. Cortes then ordered us to halt, and
            not to follow on and overtake the enemy in their flight There and then Cortes took
            possession of that land for His Majesty, performing the act in His Majesty's name. It
            was done in this way ; he drew his sword and as a sign of possession h^ made three cuts
            in a huge tree called a Ceiba^ which stood in the court of that great square, and cried
            that if any person should raise objection, that he would defend the right with the sword
            and shield which he held in his hands. All of us soldiers who were present when this
            happened cried out that he did right in taking possession of the land in His Majesty's
            name, and that we would aid him should any person say otherwise. This act was done in
            the presence of the Royal Notary. The partizans of Diego Velasquez 'chose to grumble at
            this act of taking pos- session 1 I call to mind that in that hard fought attack which
            the Indians made on us, they wounded fourteen soldiers, and ^ This was the first overt
            act showing the intenlion of Cortes to free himself from the control of Velasquez and
            place himself directly under the protection of his sovereign, a policy which was
            consummated a few weeks later on the sands at Vera Cruz. Had Cortes intended to continue
            his subservience to Diego VelÃ¡sques, his name would have been used in the formal act of
            taking possession as ii had been used in the proclamations made by Cortes in Cuba.
            FLIGHT OF MELCHOREJO. 1 13 they gave me an arrow wound in the thigh, but it was only a
            slight wound; and we found eighteen Indians dead in the water where we disembarked. We
            slept there [in thp great square] that night with guards and sentinels on the alert. I
            will stop here and go on to tell what more happened. Note.â The Carta de Vera Cruz says
            that the Indians then sent a deputation and a small present to Cortes, but still
            insisted that the Spaniards should leave the country. Cortes demanded food for his men,
            and the Indians promised to send it. Cortes then waited for two days, and as no Indians
            with food made their appearance he sent out the foraging expeditions described in the
            following Chapter. CHAPTER XXXII. How Cortes ordered two of his Captains each with a
            hundred soldiers to go and examine the country further inland, and what happened to us.
            The next morning Cortes ordered Pedro de Alvarado to set out in command of a hundred
            soldiers, iifteen of them with guns and crossbows, to examine the country inland for a
            distance of two leagues, and to take Mel- chorejo the interpreter from Cape Catoche in
            his company. When Melchorejo was looked for he could not be found as he had run off with
            the people of Tabasco, and it appears that the day before he had left the Spanish
            clothes that had been given to him hung up in the palm grove, and had fled by night in a
            canoe. Cortes was much annoyed at his flight, fearing that he would tell things to his
            fellow countrymen to our disadvantage, â well, let him go as a bit of bad luck, and let
            us get back to our story. Cortes also sent the Captain Francisco de Lugo, in another
            direction, with a hundfed soldiers, twelve of them musketeers and crossbowmen, with
            instructions not to go beyond two leagues and to return to the camp to sleep. I 114 THE
            INDIANS ATTACK. When Francisco de Lugo and his company had marched about a league from
            camp he came on a great host of Indian archers carrying lances and shields, drums and
            standards and they made straight for our company of soldiers and surrounded them on all
            sides. They were so numerous and shot their arrows so deftly that it was impossible to
            withstand them, and they hurled their fire- hardened darts and cast stones from their
            slings in such numbers that they fell like hail, and they attacked our men with their
            two-handed knife-like swords.* Stoutly as Francisco de Lugo and his soldiers fought,
            they could not ward off the enemy, and when this was clear to them, while still keeping
            a good formation, they began to retreat towards the camp. A certain Indian, a swift and
            daring runner, had been sent off to the camp to beg Cortes to come to their assistance,
            meanwhile Francisco de Lugo by careful management of his musketeers and crossbowmen,
            some loading while others fired, and by occasional charges was able to hold his own
            against all the squadrons at- tacking him. , Let us leave him in the dangerous situation
            I have described and return to Captain Pedro de Alvarado, who after marching about a
            league came on a creek which was very difficult to cross, and it pleased God our Lord so
            to lead him that he should return by another road in the direction where Francisco de
            Lugo was fighting. When he heard the reports of the muskets and the great din of drums
            and trumpets, and the shouts and whistles of the Indians, he knew that there must be a
            battle going on, so with the greatest haste but in good order he ran towards the cries
            and shots and found Captain Francisco de Lugo and his men fighting with their faces to
            the enemy, and five of the enemy lying dead. As soon as he joined forces * Macanas or
            Maquahuitls â edged with flint or obsidian. THE SCOUTING PARTIES. II 5 with Francisco de
            Lugo they turned on the Indians and drove them back, but they were not able to put them
            to flight, and the Indians followed our men right up to the camp. In like manner other
            companies of warriors had attacked us where Cortes was guarding the wounded, but we soon
            drove them off with our guns, which laid many of them low, and with our good sword play.
            When Cortes heard of Francisco de Lugo's peril from the Cuban Indian who came to beg for
            help, we promptly went to his assistance, and we met the two captains with their
            companies about half a league from the camp. Two soldiers of Francisco de Lugo's company
            were killed and eight wounded, and three of Pedro de Alvarado's company were wounded.
            When we arrived in camp we buried the dead and tended the wounded, and stationed
            sentinels and kept a strict watch. In those skirmishes we killed fifteen Indians and
            cap- tured three, one of whom seemed to be a chief, and through Aguilar, our
            interpreter, we asked them why they were so mad as to attack us, and that they could see
            that we should kill them if they attacked us again. Then one of these Indians was sent
            with some beads to give to the Caciques to bring them to peace, and that messenger told
            us that the Indian Melchorejo whom we had brought from Cape Catoche, went to the chiefs
            the night before and counselled them to fight us day and night and said that they would
            conquer us as we were few in number; so it turned out that we had brought an enemy with
            us instead of a help. This Indian whom we despatched with the message went off and never
            returned. From the other two Indian prisoners Aguilar the interpreter learnt for certain
            that by the next day the Caciques from all the neighbouring towns of the province would
            have assembled with all their forces I 2 Il6 HORSES DISEMBARKED. ready to make war on
            us, and that they would come and surround our camp, for that was Melchorejo's advice to
            them. I must leave oflF here, and will go on to tell what we did in the matter. CHAPTER
            XXXIII. How Cortes told us all to get ready by the next day to go in search of the
            Indian host, and ordered the horses to be brought from the ships, and what happened in
            the battle which we fought. As soon as Cortes knew for certain that the Indians intended
            to make war on us, he ordered all the horses to be landed from the ships without delay,
            and the cross- bowmen and musketeers and all of us soldiers, even those who were
            wounded, to have our arms ready for use. When the horses were brought on shore they were
            very stiff and afraid to move, for they had been many days on board ship, but the next
            day they moved quite freely. At that time it happened that six or seven soldiers, young
            men and otherwise in good health, suffered from pains in their loins, so that they could
            not stand on their feet and had to be carried on men's backs. We did not know what this
            sickness came from, some say that they fell ill on account of the [quilted] cotton
            armour which they never took off, but wore day and night, and because in Cuba they had
            lived daintily and were not used to hard work, so in the heat they fell ill. Cortes
            ordered them not to remain on land but to be taken at once on board ship. The best
            horses and riders were chosen to form the cavalry, and the horses had little bells
            attached to their breastplates. The men were ordered not to stop to spear those who were
            down, but to aim their lances at the faces of the enemy. PREPARATIONS FOR AN ADVANCE. 1
            1/ Thirteen gentlemen were chosen to go on horseback with Cortes in command of them, and
            I here record their names: â Cortes, CristÃ³val de Olid, Pedro de Alvarado, Alonzo
            Hernandez Puertocarrero, Juan de Escalante, Fran- cisco de Montejo, and Alonzo de ÃvÃ­la
            to whom was given the horse belonging to Ortiz the musician and BartolomÃ© Garcia, for
            neither of these men were good horsemen, Juan Velasquez de Leon, Francisco de Morla, and
            Lares the good horseman (I call him so because there was another Lares), Gonzalo
            Dominguez, an excellent horseman, Moron of Bayamo, and Pedro Gonzalez of Trujillo.
            Cortes selected all these gentlemen and went himself as their captain. Cortes ordered
            Mesa the artilleryman to have his guns ready, and he placed Diego de OrdÃ¡s in command of
            us foot soldiers and he also had command of the musketeers and bowmen, for he was no
            horseman. Very early the next day which was the day of Nuestra Seiiora de Marzo^ after
            hearing mass, which was said by Fray BartolomÃ© de Olmedo, we formed in order under our
            standard bearer, who at that time was Antonio de Villaroel the husband of Isabel de
            Ojeda, who afterwards changed his name to Antonio Serrano de Cardona, and marched to
            some large savannas where Francisco de Lugo and Pedro de Alvarado had been attacked,
            about a league distant from the camp we had left ; and that savanna and township was
            called Cintla, and was subject to Tabasco. Cortes [and the horsemen] were separated a
            short dis- tance from us on account of some swamps which could not be crossed by the
            horses, and as we were marching along in the way I have said, we came on the whole force
            of Indian warriors who were on the way to attack us in our ^ Lady-day, 25th March. Ãl8
            THE BATTLE OF CINTLA. camp. It was near the town of Cintla that we met them on an open
            plain. So it happened that those warriors were looking for us with the intention of
            attacking us, and we were looking for them for the very same purpose. I must leave off
            here, and will go on to tell what happened in the battle, and one may well call it a
            battle, as will be seen further on. CHAPTER XXXIV. How all the Caciques of Tabasco and
            its dependencies atttacked us, and what came of it. I HAVE already said how we were
            marching along when we met all the forces of the enemy which were moving in search of
            us, and all the men wore great feather crests and they carried drums and trumpets, and
            their faces were coloured black and white, and they were armed with large bows and
            arrows, lances and shields and swords shaped like our two-handed' swords, and many
            slings and stones and fire-hardened jayelins, and all wore quilted cotton armour. As
            they approached us their squadrons were so numerous that they covered the whole plain,
            and they rushed on us like mad dogs completely surrounding us, and they let fly such a
            cloud of arrows, javelins and stones that on the first assault they wounded over seventy
            of us, and fighting hand to hand they did us great damage with their lances, and one
            soldier^ fell dead at once from an arrow wound in the ear, and they kept on shooting and
            wounding us.* With our muskets and crossbows and with ^ Alonzo RemÃ³n Edition says '* a
            soldier named Saldana." * Carta de Vera Cruz says that only twenty were wounded in all,
            and that no one died of their wounds. Gomara says seventy were wounded. THE BATTLE OF*
            CINTLA. tlQ good sword play we did not fail as stout fighters, and when they came to
            feel the edge of our swords little by little they fell back, but it was only so as to
            shoot at us in greater safety. Mesa, our artilleryman, killed many of them with his
            cannon, for they were formed in great squadrons and they did not open out so that he
            could fire at them as he pleased, but with all the hurts and wounds which we gave them,
            we could not drive them off. I said to Diego de OrdÃ¡s " it seems to me that we ought to
            close up and charge them," for in truth they suffered greatly from the strokes and
            thrusts of our swords, and that was why they fell away from us, both from fear of these
            swords, and the better to shoot their arrows and hurl their javelins and the hail of
            stones. OrdÃ¡s replied that it was not good advice, for there were three hundred Indians
            to every one of us, and that we could not hold out against such a multitude, â so there
            we stood enduring their attack. However, we did agree to get as near as we could to
            them, as I had advised OrdÃ¡s, so as to give them a bad time with our swordsmanship, and
            they suffered so much from it that they retreated towards a swamp. During all this time
            Cortes and his horsemen failed to appear, although we greatly longed for him, and we
            feared that by chance some disaster had befallen him. I remember that when we fired
            shots the Indians gave great shouts and whistles and threw dust and rubbish into the air
            so that we should not see the damage done to them, and they sounded their trumpets and
            drums and shouted and whistled and cried " Alala ! alala ! " Just at this time we caught
            sight of our horsemen, and as the great Indian host was crazed with its attack on us, it
            did not at once perceive them coming up behind their backs, and as the plain was level
            ground and the horsemen were good riders, and many of the horses were very handy and
            fine gallopers, they came quickly on the Ã20 VICTORY OF THE SPANIARDS. enemy and speared
            them as they chose. As soon as we saw the horsemen we fell on the Indians with such
            energy that with us attacking on one side and the horsemen on the othfer, they soon
            turned tail. The Indians thought that the horse and its rider was all one animal, for
            they had never seen horses up to this time. The savannas and fields were crowded with
            Indians runnin^j to take refuge in the thick woods near by. After we had defeated the
            enemy Cortes told us that he had not been able to come to us sooner as there was a swamp
            in the way, and he had to fight his way through another force of warriors before he
            could reach us, and three horsemen and five horses had been wounded. As soon as the
            horsemen had dismounted under some trees and houses, we returned thanks to God for
            giving us so complete a victory. As it was Lady day we gave to the town which was
            afterwards founded here the name of Santa Maria de la Victoria, on account of this great
            victory being won on Our Lady's day. This was the first battle that we fought under
            Cortes in New Spain. After this we bound up the hurts of the wounded with cloths, for we
            had nothing else, and we doctored the horses by searing their wounds with the fat from
            the body of a dead Indian which we cut up to get out the fat, and we went to look at the
            dead lying on the plain and there were more than eight hundred of them, the greater
            number killed by thrusts, the others by the cannon, muskets and crossbows, and many were
            stretched on the ground half dead. Where the horsemen had passed, numbers of them lay
            dead or groaning from their wounds. The battle lasted over an hour, and the Indians
            fought all the time like brave warriors, until the horsemen came up. We took five
            prisoners, two of them Captains. As it was late and we had had enough of fighting, and
            we had ALLEGED APPEARANCE OF SANTIAGO. 121 not eaten anything, we returned to our camp.
            Then ^e buried the two soldiers who had been killed, one by a wound in the ear, and the
            other by a wound in the 11 throat, and we seared the wounds of the others and of Ã; the
            horses with the fat of the Indian, and after posting! sentinels and guards, we had
            supper and rested. It is on this occasion that Francisco Lopez de Gomara says that
            Francisco de Morla set out on a dapple gray horse before Cortes and the other horsemen
            arrived, and that the sainted apostles Senor Santiago and Senor San Pedro appeared. I
            say that all our doings and our victories are at the hands of our Lord Jesus Christ, and
            that in this battle there were so' many Indians to every one of us that they could have
            blinded us with the dust they raised but for the pity of God who always helped us. It
            may be that as Gomara says the Glorious Apostles Sefior Santiago and Sefior San Pedro
            came to our aid and that I, being a sinner was not worthy to behold them. What I saw was
            Francisco de Morla, on a chestnut horse, who came up at the same time as Cortes, and it
            seems to ^me that now as I , write I can see again with these sinful eyes all that
            battle Ã in the very way that it took place, and although I ami a poor sinner and not
            worthy to see either of those glorious apostles, there were there in our company over
            four hundred soldiers and Cortes himself and many other gentlemen, and it would have
            been talked about, and evidence would have been taken, and a church would have been
            built when the town was founded, and the town would have been named Santiago de la
            Victoria, or San Pedro de la Victoria instead of Santa Maria de la Victoria. If it was
            as Gomara says we must have all been very bad Christians, when our Lord God sent his
            holy Apostle to us, not to recognise the great favour that he was showing to us, and not
            daily to have venerated that church. I wish to God it were as the historian Gomara says,
            but, until I read 122 MESSENGERS DESPATCHED his history, one never heard about it among
            the conquista- dores who were there at the time. I will leave off here and go on to tell
            what else happened to us. CHAPTER XXXV. How Cortes sent to summon all the Caciques of
            those provinces and what was done about it. I HAVE already said that we captured five
            Indians during the battle of whom two were captains. When Aguilar spoke to these men he
            found out from what they said that they were fit persons to be sent as messengers, and
            he advised Cortes to free them, so that they might go and talk to the Caciques of the
            town and any others they might see. These two messengers were given green and blue
            beads, and Aguilar spoke many pleasant and flattering words to them, telling them that
            they had nothing to fear as we wished to treat them like brothers, that it was their own
            fault that they had made war on us, and that now they had better collect together all
            the Caciques of the different towns as we wished to talk to them, and he gave them much
            other advice in a gentle way so as- to gain their good will. The messengers went off
            willingly and spoke to the Caciques and chief men, and told them all we wished them to
            know about our desire for peace. When our envoys had been listened to, it was settled
            among them that fifteen Indian slaves, all with stained faces and ragged cloaks and loin
            cloths, should at once be sent to us with fowls and baked fish and maize cakes. When
            these men came before Cortes he received them graciously, but Aguilar the interpreter
            asked them rather angrily why they had come with their faces in that state, that it
            looked more as though they came to fight than to treat for peace; and he told them to go
            back to the TO SUMMON THE CACIQUES. 123' Caciques and inform them, that if they wished
            for peace in the way we offered it, chieftains should come and treat for it, as was
            always the custom, and that they should not send slaves. But even these painted faced
            slaves were treated with consideration by us and blue beads were sent by them in sign of
            peace, and to soothe their feelings. The next day thirty Indian Chieftains, clad in good
            cloaks, came to visit us and brought fowls, fish, fruit and maize cakes, and asked leave
            from Cortes to bum and bury the bodies of the dead who had fallen in the recent battles,
            so that they should not smell badly or be eaten by lions and tigers. Permission was at
            once given them and they hastened to bring many people to bury and burn the bodies
            according to their customs. Cortes learnt from the Caciques that over eight hundred men
            were missing, not counting those who had been carried off wounded.^ They said that they
            could not tarry with us either to discuss the matter or make peace, for on the morrow
            the chieftains and leaders of all the towns would have assembled, and that then they
            would agree about a peace. As Cortes was very sagacious about everything, he said,
            laughing, to us soldiers who happened to be in his company, " Do you know, gentlemen,
            that it seems to me that the Indians are terrified at the horses and may think that they
            and the cannon alone make war on them. I have thought of something which will confirm
            this belief, and that is to bring the mare belonging to Juan Sedefio, which foaled the
            other day on board ship, and tie her up where I am now standing and also to bring the
            stallion of Ortiz the musician, which is very excitable, near enough to scent the mare,
            and when he has scented her to lead ^ The Carta de Vera Cruz says the Indians were
            40^000 in number and that they lost 220 killed. 124 THE CACIQUES ASK PARDON each of them
            off separately so that the Caciques who are coming shall not hear the horse neighing as
            they approach, not until they are standing before me and are talking to me." We did just
            as Cortes ordered and brought the horse and mare, and the horse soon detected the scent
            of her in CortÃ©s's quarters. In addition to this Cortes ordered the largest cannon that
            we possessed to be loaded with a large ball and a good charge of powder. About mid-day
            forty Indians arrived, all of them Caciques of good bearing, wearing rich mantles such
            as are used by them. They saluted Cortes and all of us, and brought incense and
            fumigated all of us who were present, and they asked pardon for their past behaviour,
            and said that henceforth they would be friendly. Cortes, through Aguilar the
            Interpreter, answered them in a rather grave manner, as though he were angry, that they
            well knew how many times he had asked them to maintain peace, that the fault was theirs,
            and that now they deserved to be put to death, they and all the people of their towns,
            but that as we were the vassals of a great King and Lord named the Emperor Don Carlos,
            who had sent us to these countries, and ordered us to help and favour those who would
            enter his royal service, that if they were now as well disposed as they said they were,
            that we would take this course, but that if they were not, some of those TeÃ¾ustles would
            jump out and kill them (they call iron Tepustle in their language) for some of the
            Tepustles were still angry because thay had made war on us. At this moment the order was
            secretly given to put a match to the cannon which had been loaded, and it went off with
            such a thunderclap as was wanted, and the ball went buzzing over the hills, and as it
            was mid-day and very still it made a great noise, and the Caciques were terrified on
            hearing it. As they had never seen anything like it they believed what Cortes had told
            them was true. AND MAKE PEACE. 12$ Then Cortes told them, through Aguilar, not to be
            afraid for he had given orders that no harm should be done to them. Just then the horse
            that had scented the mare was brought and tied up not far distant from where Cortes was
            talking to the Caciques, and, as the mare had been tied up at the place where Cortes and
            the Indians were talking* the horse began to paw the ground and neigh and become wild
            with excitement, looking all the time towards the Indians and the place whence the scent
            of the mare had reached him, and the Caciques thought that he was roaring at them and
            they were terrified. When Cortes observed their state of mind, he rose from his seat and
            went to the horse and told two orderlies to lead it far away, and said to the Indians
            that he had told the horse not to be angry as they were friendly and wished to make
            peace. While this was going on there arrived more than thirty Indian carriers, whom the
            natives call Tamenes^ who brought a meal of fowls and fish and fruits and other food,
            and it appears that they had lagged behind and could not reach us at the same time as
            the Caciques. Cortes had a long conversation with these chieftains and Caciques and they
            told him that they would all come on the next day and would bring a present and would
            discuss other matters, and then they went away quite contented. And there I will leave
            them until the next day. 126 FIRST MENTION OF DOSA MARINA. CHAPTER XXXVI. How all the
            Caciques and Calachonis from the Rio de Grijalva came and brought a present, and what
            took place about it. Early the next morning, the isth March, 15 19,* many Caciques and
            chiefs of Tabasco and the neighbouring towns arrived and paid great respect to us all,
            and they brought a present of gold, consisting of four diadems and some gold lizards,
            and two [ornaments] like little dogs, and earrings, and five ducks, and two masks* with
            Indian faces, and two gold soles for sandals, and some other things of little value. I
            do not remember how much the things were worth ; and they brought cloth, such as they
            make and wear, which was quilted stuff. My readers will have heard from those who know
            that province that there is nothing of much value in it This present, however, was worth
            nothing in comparison with the twenty women that were given us, among them one very
            excellent woman called Dofia Marina, for so she was named when she became a Christian. I
            will leave off talking about her and the other women who were brought to us, and will
            tell how Cortes received this present with pleasure and went aside with all the
            Caciques, and with Aguilar, the interpreter, to hold converse, and he told them that he
            gave them thanks for what they had brought with them, but there was one thing that he
            must ask of them, namely, that they should re-occupy the town with all their people,
            women and children, and he wished to see it repeopled within two days, for he would
            recognize that as a sign of true peace. The Caciques ^ This is evidently an error, as
            Bernal Diaz has already stated that the Battle of Cintla was fought on Lady day, the
            25th March. ^ In the text "dos iiguras de Caras de Indios.'' THE CACIQUE'S REASONS FOR
            ATTACKING US. 12/ sent at once to summon all the inhabitants with their women and
            children and within two days they were again settled in the town. One other thing Cortes
            asked of the chiefs and that was to give up their idols and sacrifices, and this they
            said they would do, and, through Aguilar, Cortes told them as well as he was able about
            matters concerning our holy faith, how we were Christians and worshipped one true and
            only God, and he showed them an image of Our Lady with her precious Son in her arms and
            explained to them that we paid the greatest reverence to it as it was the image of the
            Mother of our Lord God who was in heaven. The Caciques replied that they liked the look
            of the great Teleciguata (for in their language great ladies are called Teleciguatas)
            and [begged] that she might be given them to keep in their town, and Cortes said that
            the image should be given to them and ordered them to make a well-constructed altar, and
            this they did at once. The next morning, Cortes ordered two of our carpenters, named
            Alonzo Yaftez and Alvaro Lopez, to make a very tall cross. When all this had been
            settled Cortes asked the Caciques what was their reason for attacking us three times
            when we had asked them to keep the peace ; the chief replied that he had already asked
            pardon for their acts and had been forgiven, that the Cacique of Chanpoton, his brother,
            had advised it, and that he feared to be accused of cowardice, for he had already been
            reproached and dishonoured for not having attacked the other captain who had come with
            four ships, (he must have meant Juan de Grijalva) and he also said that the Indian whom
            we had brought as an Inter- preter, who escaped in the night, had advised them to attack
            us both by day and night. Cortes then ordered this man to be brought before him without
            fail, but they replied that when he saw that the 128 " CULUA" AND " MEXICO." battle was
            going against them, he had taken to flight, and they knew not where he was although
            search had been made for him ; but we came to know that they had offered him as a
            sacrifice because his counsel had cost them so dear. Cortes also asked them where they
            procured their gold and jewels, and they replied, from the direction of the setting sun,
            and said "Culua" and "Mexico," and as we did not know what Mexico and Culua meant we
            paid little attention to it. Then we brought another interpreter named Francisco, whom
            we had captured during Grijalva's expedition, who has already been mentioned by me, but
            he understood nothing of the Tabasco language only that of Culua* which is the Mexican
            tongue. By means of signs he told Cortes that Culua was far ahead, and he repeated ''
            Mexico " which we did not understand. So the talk ceased until the next day when the
            sacred image of Our Lady and the Cross were set up on the altar and we all paid
            reverence to them, and Padre Fray Barto- lomÃ© de Olmedo said mass and all the Caciques
            and chiefs were present and we gave the name of Santa Maria de la Victoria to the town,
            and by this name the town of Tabasco is now called. The same friar, with Aguilar as
            interpreter, prea-'hed many good things about our holy faith to the twenty Indian women
            who had been given us, telling them not to believe in the Idols which they had been wont
            to trust in, for they were evil things and not gods, and that they should offer no more
            sacrifices to them for they would lead them astray, but that they should worship our
            Lord Jesus Christ, and immediately afterwards they were bap- tized. One Indian lady who
            was given to us here was christened Dona Marina, and she was truly a great chief- ^ The
            word in the text is Cuba, but clearly it must be intended for Culua, as is shown in the
            context. DOfÃA MARINA. 1 29 tainess and the daughter of great Caciques and the mistress
            of vassals, and this her appearance clearly showed. Later on I will relate why it was
            and in what manner she was brought here. I do not clearly remember the names of all the
            other women, and it is not worth while to name any of them ; however, they were the
            first women to become Christians in New Spain. Cortes allotted one of them to each of
            his captains and Dofta Marina, as she was good looking and intelligent and without
            embarrassment, he gave to Alonzo Hernandez Pucrtocarrero, who I have already said was a
            distinguished gentleman, and cousin of the Count of Medellin. When Puertocarrero went to
            Spain, Doiia Marina lived with Cortes, and bore him a son named Don Martin Cortes. We
            remained five days in this town, to look after the wounded and those who were suffering
            from pain in the loins, from which they all recovered. Furthermore, Cortes drew the
            Caciques to him by kindly converse, and told them how our master the Emperor, whose
            vassals we were, had under his orders many great lords, and that it would be well for
            them also to render him obedience, and that then, whatever they might be in need of,
            whether it was our protection or any other necessity, if they would jmake it known to
            him, no matter where he might be, he would come to their assistance. The Caciques all
            thanked him for this, and thereupon all declared themselves the vassals of our great
            Emperor. These were the first vassals to render submission to His Majesty in New Spain.
            Cortes then ordered the Caciques to come with their women and children early the next
            day, which was Palm Sunday, to the altar, to pay homage to the holy image of Our Lady
            and to the Cross, and at the same time Cortes ordered them to send six Indian carpenters
            to accompany K I30 THE PADRE DE LA MERCED CELEBRATES MASS. our carpenters to the town of
            Cintia where our Lord God was pleased to give us victory in the battle which I have
            described, there to cut a cross on a great tree called a Ceiba which grew there, and
            they did it so that it might last a long time, for as the bark is renewed the cross will
            show there for ever. When this was done he ordered the Indians to get ready all the
            canoes that they owned to help us to embark, for we wished to set sail on that holy day
            because the pilots had come to tell Cortes that the ships ran a great risk from a
            Norther which is a dangerous gale. The next day, early in the morning, all the Caciques
            and chiefs came in their canoes with all their women and children and stood in the court
            where we had placed the church and cross, and many branches of trees had already been
            cut ready to be carried in the procession. Then the Caciques beheld us all, Cortes, as
            well as the captains, and every one of us marching together with the greatest reverence
            in a devout procession, and the Padre de la Merced and the priest, Juan Diaz, clad in
            their vestments, said mass, and we paid reverence to and kissed the Holy Cross, while
            the Caciques and Indians stood looking on at us. When our solemn festival was over the
            chiefs approached and offered Cortes ten fowls, and baked fish and vegetables, and we
            took leave of them, and Cortes again commended to their care the Holy image and the
            sacred crosses and told them always to keep the place clean and well swept and to deck
            the cross with garlands and to reverence it, and then they would enjoy good health and
            bountiful harvests. It was growing late when we got on board ship and the next day,
            Monday, we set sail in the morning and with a fair wind laid our course for San Juan de
            Ulua, keeping close in shore all the time VOYAGE CONTINUED. I3I As we sailed along in
            the fine weather, wc soldiers who knew the coast would say to Cortes, "Seftor, over
            there is La Rambla, which the Indians call Ayagualulco," and soon afterwards we arrived
            off TonalÃ¡ which we called San Antonio, and we pointed it out to him. Further on we
            showed him the great river of Coatzacoalcos, and he saw the lofty snow capped mountains,
            and then the Sierra of San Martin, and further on we pointed out the split rock, which
            is a great rock standing out in the sea with a mark on the top of it which gives it the
            appearance of a seat. Again further on we showed him the Rio de Alvarado, which Pedro de
            Alvarado entered when we were with Grijalva, and then we came in sight of the Rio de
            Banderas, where we had gained in barter the sixteen thousand dollars, then we showed him
            the Isla Blanca, and told him where lay the Isla Verde, and close in shore we saw the
            Isla de Sacrificios where we found the altars and the Indian victinis in Grijalva's time
            ; and at last our good fortune brought us to San Juan de Uliia soon after midday on Holy
            Thursday. I remember that a gentleman, Alonzo Hernandez Puertocarrero came up to Cortes
            and said : " It seems to me, sir, that these gentlemen who have been twice before to
            this country are saying to you : â Cata Francia, Montesinos. Cata Paris la ciudad. Cata
            las aguas de Duero Do van a dar en la Mar. Behold France, Montesinos. Look at Paris, the
            city. See the waters of the Duero Flowing to the sea. I say that you are looking on rich
            lands, may you know how to govern them welll" Cortes knew well the purpose for which
            these words were said, and answered : ** Let God give us the good fortune in fighting
            which He gave to the Paladin Roldan, and with Your Honour and the other gentlemen for
            leaders, I shall know well how to manage it." K 2 132 THE STORY Let us leave off here,
            for this is what took place and Cortes did not go into the Rio de Alvarado, as Gomara
            says he did. CHAPTER XXXVII. Showing that Dona Marina was a Ccuica and the daughter of
            persons of high rank, and was the mistress of towns and vassals, and how it happened
            that she was taken to Tabasco. Before telling about the great Montezuma and his famous
            City of Mexico and the Mexicans, I wish to give some account of Dona Marina, who from
            her childhood had been the mistress and Cacica of towns and vassals. It happened in this
            way : Her father and mother were chiefs and Caciques of a town called Paynala, which had
            other towns subject to it, and stood about eight leagues from the town of Coatza-
            coalcos. Her father died while she was still a little child, and her mother married
            another Cacique, a young man, and bore him a son. It seems that the father and mother
            had a great affection for this son and it was agreed between them that he should succeed
            to their honours when their days were done. So that there should be no impediment to
            this, they gave the little girl, Dona Marina, to some Indians from Xicalango^ and this
            they did by night so as to escape observation, and they then spread the report that she
            had died, and as it happened at this time that a child of one of their Indian slaves
            died they gave out that it was their daughter and the heiress who was dead. The Indians
            of Xicalango gave the child to the people of Tabasco, and the Tabasco people gave her to
            Cortes. I myself knew her mother, and' the old woman's son and ^ Xicalango, on the
            southern side of the Laguna de TÃ©rminos, was an outlying stronghold of the Aztec Empire.

            was already grown up and ruled the town jointly with his mother, for the second husband
            of the old lady was dead. When they became Christians, the old lady was called Marta and
            the son LÃ¡zaro. I knew all this very well because in the year 1523 after the con- quest
            of Mexico and the other provinces, when CristÃ³val de Olid revolted in Honduras, and
            Cortes was -on his way there, he passed through Coatzacoalcos and I and the greater
            number of the settlers of that town accompanied him on that expedition as I shall relate
            in the proper time and place. As Dofia Marina proved herself such an excellent woman and
            good interpreter throughout the wars in New Spain, Tlascala and Mexico (as I shall show
            later on), Cortes always took her with him, and during that expedition she was married
            to a gentleman named Juan Jaramillo at the town of Orizaba, before certain witnesses,
            one of whom was named Aranda, a settler in Tabasco and this man told [me] about the
            marriage (not in the way the historian Gomara relates it). Dofla Marina was a person of
            the greatest importance and was obeyed without question by the Indians through- out New
            Spain. When Cortes was in the town of Coatzacoalcos he sent to summon to his presence
            all the Caciques of that province in order to make them a speech about our holy
            religion, and about their good treatment, and among the Caciques who assembled was the
            mother of Dona Marina and her half-brother, LÃ¡zaro. Some time before this Dona Marina
            had told me that she belonged to that province and that she was the mistress of vassals,
            and Cortes also knew it well, as did Aguilar, the interpreter. In such a manner it was
            that mother, daughter and son came together, and it was easy enough to see that she was
            the daughter from the strong likeness she bore to her mother. 134 THE STORY These
            relations were in great fear of Dona Marina, for they thought that she had sent for them
            to put them to death, and they were weeping. When Dona Marina saw them in tears, she
            consoled them and told them to have no fear, that when they had given her over to the
            men from Xicalango, they knew not what they were doing, and she forgave them for doing
            it, " and she gave them many jewels of gold, and raiment, and told them to return to
            their town, and said that God had been very gracious to her in freeing her from the
            worship of idols and making her a Christian, and letting her bear a son to her lord and
            master Cortes and in marrying her to such a gentleman as Juan Jaramillo, who was now her
            husband. That she would rather serve her husband and Cortes than anything else in the
            world, and would not exchange her place to be Cacica of all the provinces in New Spain.
            All this which I have repeated here I know for certain (and I swear to it.)^ This seems
            to me very much like what took place between Joseph and his brethren in Egypt when they
            came into his power over the matter of the wheat. It is what actually happened and not
            the story which was told to Gomara, who also says other things which I will leave
            unnoticed. To go back to my subject : Dona Marina knew the language of Coatzacoalcos,
            which is that common to Mexico, and she knew the language of Tabasco, as did also
            JerÃ³nimo de Aguilar, who spoke the language of Yucatan and Tabasco, which is one and the
            same. So that these two could understand one another clearly, and Aguilar translated
            into Castilian for Cortes. ^ The words in brackets are blotted out in the original MS.
            -G. G. OF DOÃÃA MARINA. 135 This was the great beginning of our conquests and thus,
            thanks be to God, things prospered with us. I have made a point of explaining this
            matter, because without the help of Dona Marina we could not have understood the
            language of New Spain and Mexico. Here I will leave off, and go on later to tell how we
            dis- embarked in the Port of San Juan de UlÃºa. BOOK III. T^E MARCH INLAND. CHAPTER
            XXXVIII. How we arrived with all the ships at San Juan de UlÃºa, and what happened there.
            N Holy Thursday, the anniversary of the Last Supper of Our Lord, in the yeaf 1 5 19, we
            arrived with all the fleet at the Port of San Juan de Uliia, and as the Pilot Alaminos
            knew the place well from having come there with Juan de Grijalva he at once ordered the
            vessels to drop anchor where they would be safe from the northerly gales. The flagship
            hoisted her royal standards and pennants, and within half an hour of anchoring, two
            large canoes (which in those parts are called piraguas) came out to us, full of Mexican
            Indians. Seeing the big ship with the standards flying they knew that it was there they
            must go to speak with the captain ; so they went direct to the flagship and going on
            board asked who was the Tatuan^ which in their language means the chief. Dona Marina who
            understood the language well, pointed him out. Then the Indians paid many marks 1
            Tlatoan. SAN JUAN DE ULUA. 1 37 of respect to Cortes, according to their usage, and bade
            him welcome, and said that their lord, a servant of the great Montezuma, had sent them
            to ask what kind of men we were and of what we were in search, and added that if we were
            in need of anything for ourselves or the ships, that we should tell them and they would
            supply it Our Cortes thanked them through the two interpreters, Aguilar and Doila
            Marina, and ordered food and wine to be given them and some blue beads, and after they
            had drunk he told them that we came to see them and to trade with them and that our
            arrival in their country should cause them no uneasiness but be looked on by them as
            fortunate. The messengers returned on shore well content, and the next day, which was
            Good Friday, we disembarked with the horses and guns, on some sand hills which rise to a
            considerable height, for there was no level land, nothing but sand dunes; and the
            artilleryman Mesa placed the guns in position to the best of his judgment Then we set up
            an altar where mass was said and we made huts and shelters for Cortes and the captains,
            and three hundred of the soldiers brought wood and made huts for themselves and we
            placed the horses where they would be safe and in this way was Good Friday passed. The
            next day, Saturday, Easter Eve, many Indians arrived sent by a chief who was a governor
            under Monte- "^uma, named Pitalpitoque ^ (whom we afterwards called Ovandillo), and they
            brought axes and dressed wood for the huts of the captain Cortes and the other ranchos
            near to it, and covered them with large cloths on account of the strength of the sun,
            for as it was in Lent the heat was very great â and they brought fowls and maize cakes
            and plums, which were then in season, and I think that they brought ^ Pitaljpitoaue Â»
            Cuitlalpitoc, who had been sent as an ambassador to meet Grijalva. See Orozco y Berra^
            pp. 44 and 132, vol. iv. 138 THE GOVERNOR OF THE PROVINCE some gold jewels, and they
            presented all these things to Cortes ; and said that the next day a governor would come
            and would bring more food. Cortes thanked them heartily and ordered them to be given
            certain articles in exchange with which they went away well content. The next day,
            Easter Sunday, the governor whom they spoke of arrived. His name was Tendile,^ a man of
            affairs, and he brought with him Pitalpitoque who was also a man of importance amongst
            the natives and there followed them many Indians with presents of fowls and vegetables.
            Tendile ordered these people to stand aside on a hillock and with much humility he made
            three obeisances to Cortes according to their custom,* and then to all the soldiers who
            were standing around. Cortes bade them welcome through our interpreters and embraced
            them and asked them to wait, as he wished presently to speak to them. Meanwhile he
            ordered an altar to be made as well as it could be done in the time, and Fray BartolomÃ©
            de Olmedo, who was a fine singer, chanted Mass, and Padre Juan Diaz' assisted, and the
            two governors and the other chiefs who were with them looked on. When Mass was over,
            Cortes and some of our captains and the two Indian officers of the great Montezuma dined
            together. When the tables had been cleared away â Cortes went aside with the two
            Caciques and our two interpreters and explained to them that we were Christians and
            vassals of the greatest lord on earth, called the Emperor Don Carlos, who had many great
            princes as his vassals and servants, and that it was at his orders that we had come to
            this country, because for many years he had heard rumours 1 Teuhtlilli, Governor of
            Cuetlaxtla (Cotaxtla of modem maps). * Blotted out in the originalâ" and they brought

            and other soldiers who helped him."â G. G. VISITS THE SPANISH CAMP. 1 39 about the
            country and the great prince who ruled it. That/ he wished to be friends with this
            prince and to tell him . many things in the name of the Emperor which things,, when he
            knew and understood them, would please him greatly. Moreover he wished to trade with
            their prince and his Indians in good friendship, and he wanted to know where this prince
            would wish that they should meet so that they might confer together. Tendile replied
            some- what proudly, and said â " You have only just now arrived and you already ask to
            speak with our prince ; accept now this present which we give you in his name, and
            afterwards you will tell me what you think fitting." With that he took out a petaca â
            which is a sort of chest, many articles of gold beautifully and richly worked and
            ordered ten loads of white cloth made of cotton and feathers to be brought, wonderful
            things to see, and there were other things which I do not remember, besides quantities
            of food consisting of fowls of the country,^ fruit and baked fish. Cortes received it
            all with smiles in a gracious manner and gave in return* beads of twisted glass and
            other small beads from Spain, and he begged them to send to their towns to ask the
            people to come and trade with us as he had brought many beads to exchange for gold, and
            they replied that they would do as he asked. As we afterwards found out, these two men,
            Tendile and Pitalpitoque, were the governors of the provinces named Cotustan,
            Tustepeque,^ Guazpal- tepeque and Tatalteco, and of some other townships lately
            conquered. Cortes then ordered his servants to bring an arm-chair, richly carved and
            inlaid and some margaritas? stones with many [intricate] designs in them, and a string *
            Turkeys, Huajolotes (Mex.). * Cotaxtla, Tuxtepec. ' Piedras margaritas, possibly
            margajita ; probably mossagate or lapis lazuli. 140 PICTURES OF THE SPANIARDS of twisted
            glass beads* packed in cotton scented with musk and a crimson cap with a golden medal
            engraved with a figure of St George on horseback, lance in hand, slaying the dragon, and
            he told Tendile that he should send the chair to his prince Montezuma (for we already
            knew that he was so called) so that he could be seated in it when he, Cortes, came to
            see and speak with him, and that he should place the cap on his head, and that the
            stones and all the other things were presents from our lord the King, as a sign of his
            friendship, for he was aware that Montezuma was a great prince, and Cortes asked that a
            day and a place might be named where he could go to see Montezuma. Tendile received the
            present and said that his lord Montezuma was such a great prince that it would please
            him to know our great King and that he would carry the present to him at once and bring
            back a reply. It appears that Tendile brought with him some clever painters such as they
            had in Mexico and ordered them to make pictures true to nature of the face and body of
            Cortes and all his captains, and of the soldiers, ships, sails and horses, and of Dofta
            Marina and Aguilar, even of the two greyhounds, and the cannon and cannon balls, and all
            of the army we had brought with us, and he carried the pictures to his master. Cortes
            ordered our gunners to load the lombards with a great charge of powder so that they
            should make a great noise when they were fired off, and he told Pedro de Alvarado that
            he and all the horsemen should get ready so that these servants of Montezuma might see
            them gallop and told them to attach little bells to the horses' breastplates. Cortes
            also mounted his horse and said â " It would be well if we could gallop on these sand
            dunes but they will observe that even when ^ Diamantes torcidos. ARE DRAWN BY MEXICAN
            ARTISTS. I4I on foot we get stuck in the sand â let us go out to the beach when the tide
            is low and gallop two and two ;" â and to Pedro de Alvarado whose sorrel coloured mare
            was a great galloper, and very handy, he gave charge of all the horsemen. All this was
            carried out in the presence of the two ambassadors, and so that they should see the
            cannon fired, Cortes made as though he wished again to speak to them and a number of
            other chieftains, and the lombards were fired off, and as it was quite still at that
            moment, the stones went flying through the forest resounding with a great din, and the
            two governors and all the other Indians were frightened by things so new to them, and
            ordered the painters to record them so that Montezuma might see. It happened that one of
            the soldiers had a helmet half gilt but somewhat rusty and this Tendile noticed, for he
            was the more forward of the two ambassadors, and said that he wished to see it as it was
            like one that they possessed which had been left to them by their ancestors of the race
            from which they had sprung, and that it had been placed on the head of their god â
            Huichilobos,^ and that their prince Montezuma would like to see this helmet So it was
            given to him, and Cortes said to them that as he wished to know whether the gold of this
            country was the same as that we find in our rivers, they could return the helmet filled
            with grains of gold so that he could send it to our great Emperor. After this, Tendile
            bade farewell to Cortes and to all of us and after many expressions of regard from
            Cortes he took leave of him and said that he would return with a reply without delay.
            After Tendile had departed we found out that besides being an Indian employed in matters
            of great importance, Tendile was the most active of the servants whom his master,
            Montezuma, had in ^ Huitzilopochtli. 142 BARGAINING FOR FOOD. his employ, and he went
            with all haste and narrated everything to his prince, and showed him the pictures which
            had been painted and the present which Cortes had sent. When the great Montezuma gazed
            on it he was struck with admiration and received it on his part with satisfaction. When
            he examined the helmet and that which was on his Huichilobos, he felt convinced that we
            belonged to the race which, as his forefathers had foretold would come to rule over that
            land. It is here that the historian Gomara relates many things which were not told to
            him correctly. I will leave off here, and then go on to say what else happened. CHAPTER
            XXXIX. How Tendile went to report to bis Prince Montezuma and to carry the present, and
            what we did in our camp. When Tendile departed with the present which the Captain Cortes
            gave him for his prince Montezuma, the other governor, Pitalpitoque, stayed in our camp
            and occupied some huts a little distance from ours, and they brought Indian women there
            to make maize bread, and brought fowls and fruit and fish, and supplied Cortes and the
            captains who fed with him. As for us soldiers, if we did not hunt for shell fish on the
            beach, or go out fishing, we did not get anything. About that time, many Indians came
            from the towns already mentioned by me over which these two servants of Montezuma were
            governors, and some of them brought gold and jewels of little value, and fowls to
            exchange with us for our goods, which consisted of green beads and clear glass beads and
            other articles, and with this we managed to supply ourselves with food. Almost all the
            soldiers had brought things for barter, as we learnt in Grijalva's time TENDILE RETURNS
            FROM MEXICO. 143 that it was a good thing to bring beads â and in this manner six or
            seven days passed by. Then one morning, Tendile arrived with more than one hundred laden
            Indians, accompanied by a great Mexican Cacique, who in his face, features and
            appearance bore a strong likeness to our Captain Cortes and the great Montezuma had sent
            him purposely, for it is said that when Tendile brought the portrait of Cortes all the
            chiefs who were in Montezuma's company said that a great chief named Quintalbor looked
            exactly like Cortes and that was the name of the Cacique who now arrived with Tendile ;
            and as he was so like Cortes we called them in camp " our Cortes" and " the other
            Cortes." To go back to my story, when these people arrived and came before our Captain
            they first of all kissed the earth^ and then fumigated him and all the soldiers who were
            standing around him, with incense which they brought in brasiers of pottery. Cortes
            received them aflFectionately and seated them near himself, and that chief who came with
            the present (who I have already said was named Quintalbor) had been appointed spokesman
            together with Tendile. After welcoming us to the country and after many courteous
            speeches had passed he ordered the presents which he had brought to be dis- played, and
            they were placed on mats which they call petates over which were spread cotton cloths.*
            The first article presented was a wheel like a sun, as big as a cart- wheel, with many
            sorts of pictures on it, the whole of fine gold, and a wonderful thing to behold, which
            those who afterwards weighed it said was worth more than ten thousand dollars. Then
            another wheel was presented of greater size made of silver of great brilliancy in ' On
            seeing Don Hernando Cortes they made the usual obeisance, placing the forefinger {dedo
            mayor) of the right hand on the ground and raising it to the mouth, {firozco y Berra,
            vol. iv, p. 127.) ^ See Appendix A. Montezuma's gifts to Cortes. 144 MONTEZUMA'S GIFTS
            TO CORTES. imitation of the moon with other figures shown on it, and this was of great
            value as it was very heavy â and the chief brought back the helmet full of fine grains
            of gold, just as they are got out of the mines, and this was worth three thousand
            dollars. This gold in the helmet was worth more to us than if it had contained $20,000,
            because it showed us that there were good mines there. Then were brought twenty golden
            ducks, beauti- fully worked and very natural looking, and some [orna- ments] like dogs,
            of the kind they keep, and many articles of gold worked in the shape of tigers and lions
            and monkeys, and ten collars beautifully worked and other necklaces ; and twelve arrows
            and a bow with its string, and two rods like staffs of justice, five palms long, all in
            beautiful hollow work of fine gold. Then there were presented crests of gold and plumes
            of rich green feathers, and others of silver, and fans of the same materials, and deer
            copied in hollow gold and many other things that I cannot remember for it all happened
            so many years ago. And then over thirty loads of beautiful cotton cloth were brought
            worked with many patterns and decorated with many coloured feathers, and so many other
            things were there that it is useless my trying to describe them for I know not how to do
            it When all these things had been presented, this great Cacique Quintalbor and Tendile
            asked Cortes to accept this present with the same willingness with which his prince had
            sent it, and divide it among the teules} and men who accompanied him. Cortes received
            the present with delight and then the ambassadors told Cortes that they wished to repeat
            what their prince, Montezuma, had sent them to say. First of all they told him that he
            was pleased that such valiant men, as he had heard that we ^ Teules^ "for so they call
            the Idols which they worship." See p. 172. THE AMBASSADORS RETURN TO MEXICO. 1 45 were,
            should come to his country, for he knew all about what we had done at Tabasco, and that
            he would much like to see our great emperor who was such a mighty prince and whose fame
            was spread over so many lands, and that he would send him a present of precious stones ;
            and that meanwhile we should stay in that port ; that if he could assist us in any way
            he would do so with the greatest pleasure ; but as to the interview, they should not
            worry about it; that there was no need for it and they (the ambassadors) urged many
            objections. Cortes kept a good countenance, and returned his thanks to them, and with
            many flattering expressions gave each of the ambassadors two holland shirts and some
            blue glass beads and other things, and begged them to go back as his ambassadors to
            Mexico and to tell their prince, the great Montezuma, that as we had come across so many
            seas, and had journeyed from such distant lands solely to see and speak with him in
            person, that if we should return thus, that our great king and lord would not receive us
            well, and that wherever their prince Montezuma might be we wished to go and see him and
            do what he might order us to do. The ambassadors replied that they would go back and
            give this message to their prince, but as to the question of the desired- interview â
            they considered it superfluous. By these ambassadors Cortes sent what our poverty could
            affprd as a gift to Montezuma : a glass cup of Florentine ware, engraved with trees and
            hunting scenes and gilt, and three holland shirts and other things, and he charged the
            messengers to bring a reply. The two governors set out and Pitalpitoque remained in camp
            ; for it seems that the other servants of Montezuma had given him orders to see that
            food was brought to us from the neighbouring towns. Here I will leave off*, and then go
            on to tell what happened in our camp. 146 DISCOVERY OF QUIAHUITZTLAN. CHAPTER XL. How
            Cortes sent to look for another harbour and site where to make a settlement, and what
            was done about it. As soon as the messengers had been sent off to Mexico, Cortes
            despatched two ships to go and explore the coast further along, and placed Francisco de
            Montejo in com- mand of them and ordered him to follow the course we had taken with
            Grijalva (for Montejo had accompanied us during Grijalva's expedition) and to seek out a
            safe harbour, and search for lands where we could settle, for it was clear that we could
            not settle on those sand dunes, both on account of the mosquitoes and the distance from
            other towns. Cortes ordered Alaminos and Juan Alvarez el Manquillo to go as pilots as
            they knew the route, and told them to sail as far along the coast as was possible in ten
            days. They did as they were told and arrived at the Rio Grande, which is close to
            Panuco,^ which we had reached during the expedition under the Captain Juan de Grijalva.
            They were not able to proceed any further on account of the strong currents. Seeing how
            difficult the navigation had become, they turned round and made for San Juan de Uliia,
            without having made any further progress, or having anything to tell us, beyond the news
            that, twelve leagues away, they had seen a town looking like a fortified harbour which
            was called Quiahuitztlan, and that near that town was a harbour where the pilot
            Alaminois thought that the ships would be safe from the northerly gales. He gave to it
            an ugly name, that of Bernal, for it is like another harbour in Spain of that name. In
            these comings and goings Montejo was occupied ten or twelve days, 1 The expedition under
            Grijalva did not pass beyond Cape Rojo. MONTEZUMA REFUSES TO MEET CORTES. I47 I must now
            go back to say that the Indian Pitalpitoque, who remained behind to look after the food,
            slackened his efforts to such an extent that no provisions reached the camp and we were
            greatly in need of food, for the cassava turned sour from the damp and rotted and became
            foul with weevils and if we had not gone hunting for shell fish we should have had
            nothing to eat. The Indians who used to come bringing gold and fowls for barter, did not
            come in such numbers as on our first arrival and those who did come were very shy and
            cautious and we began to count the hours that must elapse before the return of the
            messengers who had gone to Mexico. We were thus waiting when Tendile returned
            accompanied by many Indians, and after having paid their respects in the usual manner by
            fumigating Cortes and the rest of us with incense, he presented ten loads of fine rich
            feather cloth^ and four chalchihuites, which are green stones of very great value, and
            held in the greatest esteem among the Indians, more than emeralds are by us, and certain
            other gold articles. Not counting the chalchihuites, the gold alone was said to be worth
            three thousand dollars. Then Tendile and Pitalpitoque approached (the other great
            cacique, Quintalbor, fell ill on the road and did not return) and those two governors
            went aside with Cortes and Dona Manila and Aguilar, and reported that their prince
            Montezuma had accepted the present and was greatly pleased with it, but as to an
            interview, that no more should be said about it; that these rich stones of chal-
            chihuite should be sent to the great Emperor as they were of the highest value, each one
            being worth more and being esteemed more highly than a great load of gold, and that it
            was not worth while to send any more messengers to Mexico. Cortes thanked the messengers
            and gave them presents, but it was certainly a disappointment to him to be told so
            distinctly that we could not see Montezuma, L 2 148 CORTES TELLS THE MEXICANS .and he
            said to some soldiers who happened to be standing near : " Surely this must be a gjreat
            and rich prince, and some day, please God, we must go and see him"â and the soldiers
            answered : " We wish that we were already living with him !" Let us now leave this
            question of visits and relate that it was now the time of the Ave Maria, and at the
            sound of a bell which we had in the camp we all fell on our knees before a cross placed
            on a sand hill and said our prayers of the Ave Maria before the cross. When Tendile and
            Fitalpitoque saw us thus kneeling, as they were very intelligent, they asked what was
            the reason that we humbled ourselves before a tree cut in that particular way. As Cortes
            heard this remark he said to the Padre de la Merced who was present : " It is a good
            opportunity, father, as we have good material at hand, to explain through our
            interpreters matters touching our holy faith." then he delivered a discourse to the
            Caciques so I fitting to the occasion that no good theologian could have bettered it
            After telling them that we were Christians and relating all the matters pertaining to
            our holy religion, he told them that their idols were not good but evil things which
            would take flight at the presence of that sign of the cross, for on a similar cross the
            Lord of Heaven and earth and all created things suffered passion and death ; that it is
            He whom we adore and in whom we believe, our true God, Jesus Christ, who had been
            willing to suffer and die in order to save the whole human race ; that the third day He
            rose again and is now in heaven ; and that by Him we shall all be judged. Cortes said
            many other .things very well expressed, which they thoroughly understood, and they
            replied that they would report them to their prince Montezuma. Cortes also told them
            that one of the objects for which our great Emperor had sent us to their countries W4S
            to abolish human sacrifices, and the other , inrou I And AfeOUT TtÃ­E CHRISTIAN HELÃGÃON.
            Ã49 evil rites which they practised and to see that they did not rob one another, or
            worship those cursed images. And Cortes prayed them to set up in their city, in the
            temples where they kept the idols which they believed to be gods, a cross like the one
            they saw before them, and to set up in the same place an image of Our Lady, which he
            would give them, with her precious son in her arms, and they would see how well it would
            go with them, and what our God would do for them. However, as many other argu- ments
            were used and as I do not know how to write them all out at length I will leave the
            subject and recall to mind that on this latest visit many Indians came with Tendile, who
            were wishing to barter articles of gold, which, how- ever, were of no great value. So
            all the soldiers set about bartering, and the gold which we gained by this barter we
            gave to the sailors who were out fishing in exchange for their fish so as to get
            something to eat, for otherwise we often underwent great privations through hunger.
            Cortes was pleased at this although he pretended not to see what was going on, and many
            of the servants and friends of Diego Velasquez asked him why he did not prevent us from
            bartering. What happened about this I will tell later. CHAPTER XLI. What was done about
            the bartering for gold, and other things that took place in camp. When the friends of
            Diego Velasquez saw that some of us soldiers were bartering for gold, they asked Cortes
            why he permitted it, and said that Diego Velasquez did not send out the expedition in
            order that the soldiers should carry oflF most of the gold, and that it would be as well
            to issue an order that for the future no gold should be 150 DISPUTES ABOUT BARTERING FOR
            GOLD. bartered for by anyone but Cortes himself and that all the gold already obtained
            should be displayed so that the royal fifth might be taken from it, and that some
            suitable person should be placed in charge of the treasury. To all this Cortes replied
            that all they said was good, and that they themselves should name that person, and they
            chose Gonzalo Mejia. When this had been done, Cortes turned to them with angry mien and
            said : "Observe, gentlemen, that our companions are suffering great hard- ships from
            want of food, and it is for this reason that we ought to overlook things, so that they
            may all find something to eat ; all the more so as the amount of gold they bargain for
            is but a trifle, â and God willing, we are going to obtain a large amount of it However,
            there are two sides to everything ; the order has been issued that bartering for gold
            shall cease, as you desired ; we shall see next what we will get to eat" This is where
            the historian, Gomara, states that Cortes did this so that Montezuma might think that we
            cared nothing for gold, but he (Gomara) was not well informed, for ever â¢ since the
            event of Grijalva's visit to the Rio de Banderas, Montezuma must have understood well
            enough, and even more so when we sent the helmet to him with a request that it should be
            filled with gold grains from the mines, besides they had seen us bargaining and the
            Mexicans were not the sort of people to misunderstand the meaning of it all. Let us drop
            this subject then, which Gomara says he knows about because " they told him so" and 1
            will go on to relate how, one morning, we woke up to find not a single Indian in any of
            their huts, neither those who used to bring the food, nor those who came to trade, nor
            Pital- pitoque himself; they had all fled without saying a word. The cause of this, as
            we afterwards learned, was that Montezuma had sent orders to avoid further conversation
            THE ME5C1CAKS t)ESERT THE CAMP. IJl with Cortes land those in his company ; for it
            appears that Montezuma was very much devoted to his idols, named Tezcatepuca, and
            Huichilobos, the latter the god of war, and Tezcatepuca, the god of hell ; and daily he
            sacrificed youths to them so as to get an answer from the gods as to what he should do
            about us ; for Montezuma had already formed a plan, if we did not go off in the ships,
            to get us all into his power, and to raise a breed of us^ and also to keep us for
            sacrifice. As we afterwards found out, the reply given by the gods was that he should
            not listen to Cortes, nor to the message which he sent about setting up a cross and an
            image of Our Lady, and that such things should not be brought to the city. This was the
            reason why the Indians left our camp without warning. When we heard the news we thought
            that they meant to make war on us, and we were very much on the alert. One day, as I and
            another soldier were stationed on some sand dunes keeping a look out, we saw five
            Indians coming along the beach, and so as not to raise a scare in camp over so small a
            matter, we permitted them to approach. When they came up to us with smiling countenances
            they paid us homage according to their custom, and made signs that we should take them
            into camp. I told my companion to remain where he was and I would accompany the Indians,
            . for at that time my feet were not as heavy as they are now that I am old, and when we
            came before Cortes the Indians paid him every mark of respect and said : Lope luzio,
            lope luzio â which in the Totonac language means: "prince and great lord." Thes2 men had
            large holes in their lower lips, some with stone disks in them spotted with blue, and
            others with thin leaves of gold. They also had their ears pierced with large holes in
            which were placed disks of * Blotted out in the original MS. â With which to make war. â

            they diflfered greatly from the Mexicans who had been sta3Ã¡ng with us. When DoSa Marina
            and Aguilar, the Interpreterji, heard the word Lcpe luzio they did not understand it,
            and Dona Marina asked in Mexican if there were not among them Nahuatatos, that is,
            interpreters of the Mexican language, and two of the five answered yes^ that they
            understood and spoke it, and they bade us welcome and said that their chief had sent
            them to ask who we might be, and that it would please him to be of service to such
            valiant men, for it appeared that they knew about our doings at Tabasco and Potonchan,
            and they added that they would have come to see us before but for fear of the people of
            Culua who had been with us, (by Culua they meant Mexicans, as we might say Cordovans, or
            rustics) and that they knew that three days ago they had fled back to their own country,
            and in the course of their talk Cortes found out that Monte- zuma had opponents and
            enemies, which he was delighted to hear, and after flattering these five messengers and
            giving them presents he bade them farewell, asking them to tell their chief that he
            would very soon come and pay them a visit. From this time on we called those Indians the
            Lope luzios. I must leave them now and go on to say that in those sand dunes where we
            were camped there were always many mosquitos, both long-legged ones and small ones which
            are called xexenes which are worse than the large ones, and we could get no sleep on
            account of them. We were very short of food and the cassava bread was disappearing, and
            what there was of it was very damp and foul with weevils. Some of the soldiers who
            possessed Indians in the Island of Cuba were continually sighing for their homes,
            especially the friends and servants of Diego ValÃ¡squez. When Cortes noted the state of
            affairs and the wishes of these men he gave orders that we should go to the fortified
            town which had been seen by Montejo and â¢ DISCONTENT OF THE PARTISANS OP VeLÃSQUEZ. 153
            the pilot, Alaminos, named Quiahuitztlan where the ships would be under the protection
            of the rock which I have mentioned. When arrangements were being made for us to start,
            all the friends, relations and servants of Diego Velasquez asked Cortes why he wanted to
            make that journey without having any provisions, seeing that there was no possibility of
            going on any further and that over thirty five soldiers had already died in camp from
            wounds inflicted at Tabasco, and from sickness and hunger ; that the country we were in
            was a great one and the settlements very thickly peopled and that any day they might
            make war on us ; that it would be much better to return to Cuba and account to Diego
            Velasquez for the gold gained in barter, which already amounted to a large sum, and the
            great presents from Montezuma, the sun and the silver moon and the helmet full of golden
            grains from the mines, and all the cloths and jewels already mentioned by me. Cortes
            replied to them that it was not good advice to recommend our going back without reason ;
            that hitherto we could not complain of our fortune and should give thanks to God who was
            helping us in everything, and as for those who had died, that that always happened in
            wars and under hardship ; that it would be as well to find out what the country
            contained ; that meanwhile we could eat the maize and other food held by the Indians and
            by the neighbouring towns, unless our hands had lost their cunning. With this reply, the
            partisans of Diego Velas- quez were somewhat, but not wholly appeased, for there were
            already cliques formed in camp who discussed the return to Cuba. I will leave off here
            and then go on to say what happened* 154 THE PARTISANS OF CORTES CHAPTER XLII. How we
            raised Hernando Cortes to the post of Captain General and Chief Justice, until His
            Majesty's wishes on the matter should b^ known, and what was done about it. I HAVE
            already said that the relations and friends of Di^o Velasquez were going about the camp
            raising objections to our going on any further and insisting that we should return at
            once from San Juan de UlÃºa to the Island of Cuba. It appears that Cortes had already
            talked the matter over with Alonzo Hernandez Puertocarrero, and Pedro de Alvarado and
            his four brothers, Jorge, GonzaÃoÂ« Gomez and Juan, and with Cristobal de Olid, Alonzo de
            Ãvila, Juan de Escalante, Francisco de Lugo, and with me and other gentlemen and
            captains, and suggested that we should beg of him to be our captain. Francisco de
            Montejo understood what was going on and was on the watch. One night, after midnight,
            Alonzo Hernandez Puertocarrero, Juan de Escalante and Francisco de Lugo, came to my hut
            Francisco de Lugo and I came from the same country and were distant kinsmen. They said
            to me : " Senor Bernal Diaz, come out with your arms and go the rounds ; we will
            accompany Cortes who is just now going the rounds." When I was a little distance from
            the hut they said to me : " Look to it, sir, that you keep secret for a time what we
            wish to tell you, for it is a matter of importance, and see that your companions in your
            hn% know nothing about it, for they are of the party of Di^o Velasquez." What they said
            to me was: "Sir, does it seem to you to be right that Hernando Cortes should have
            deceived us all in bringing us here, he having proclaimed in Cuba that he was coming to
            settle, and now we find out that he has no power to do so, but only to trade, and they
            want us to return to Santiago de Cuba with all the gold INTRIGUE ON HIS BEHALF. 1 55
            that has been collected, and we shall lose our all, for will not Diego Velasquez take
            all the gold as he did before ? Look, sir, counting this present expedition, you have
            already come to this country three times, spending your own property and contracting
            debts and risking your life many times with the wounds you have received. Many of us
            gentlemen who know that we are your honour's friends wish you to understand that this
            must not go on ; that this land must be settled in the name of His Majesty, and by
            Hernando Cortes in His Majesty's name, while we await the opportunity to make it known
            to our lord the King in Spain. Be sure, sir, to cast your vote so that all of us
            unanimously and willingly choose him captain, for it will be a service to God and our
            lord the King." I replied that it was not a wise decision to return to Cuba and that it
            would be a good thing for the country to be settled and that we should choose Cortes as
            General and Chief Justice until his Majesty should order otherwise. This agreement
            passed from soldier to soldier and the friends and relations of Diego Velasquez, who
            were more numerous than we were, got to know of it, and with over- bold words asked
            Cortes why he was craftily arranging to remain in this country instead of returning to
            render an account of his doings to the man who had sent him as captain, and they told
            him that Diego Velasquez would net approve of it, and that the sooner we embarked the
            better ; that there was no use in his subterfuges and secret meet- ings with the
            soldiers, for we had neither supplies nor men^ nor any possibility of founding a
            settlement Cortes answered without a sign of anger, and said that he agreed with them ;
            that he would not go against the instructions and notes which he had received from Diego
            Velasquez, and he issued an order for us all to embark on the following day, each one in
            the ship in which he had come. We who had made the agreement answered that it was ÃS6
            CORTÃS ELECTED CAPTAIN GENERAL. not fair to deceive us so, that in Cuba he had
            proclaimed that he was coming to make a settlement, whereas he had only come to trade ;
            and we demanded on behalf of our Lord God and of His Majesty that he should at once form
            a settlement and give up any other plan, because that would be of the greatest benefit
            and service to God and the King ; and they placed many other well-reasoned arguments
            before him saying that the natives would never let us land again as they had done this
            time, and that as soon as a settlement was made in the country soldiers would gather in
            from all the islands to give us help and that Velasquez had ruined us all by stating
            publicly that he had received a decree from His Majesty to form a settlement, the
            contrary being the case ; that we wished to form a settlement, and to let those depart
            who desired to return to Cuba. So Cortes agreed to it, although he pre- tended to need
            much begging, as the saying goes : " You are very pressing, and I want to do it,"^ â and
            he stipulated that we should make him Chief Justice and Captain General, and the worst
            of all that we conceded was that we should give him a fifth of all the gold which should
            be obtainedi after the royal fifth had been deducted, and then we gave him the very
            fullest powers in the presence of the King's Notary, Diego de Godoy, embracing all that
            I have here stated. We at once set to work to found and settle a town, which was called
            the " Villa rica de la Vera Cruz" because we arrived on Thursday of the (last) supper
            and landed on " Holy Friday of the Cross" and " rich" because of what that gentleman
            said, as I have related in a former chapter (xxvi) who approached Cortes and said to him
            : " Behold rich lands 1 May you know how to govern them well ! " and what he wanted to
            say was â " May you * " Tu me lo ruegas y yo me lo quiero." VILLA RICA DE LA VERA CRUZ
            FOUNDED. 1 57 remain as their Captain General." That gentleman was Alonzo Hernandez
            Puertocarrero. To go back to my story : as soon as the town was founded we appointed
            alcaldes and regidores ; the former were Alonzo Hernandez Puertocarrero and Francisco
            Montejo. In the case of Montejo, it was because .he was not on very good terms with
            Cortes that Cortes ordered him to be named as Alcalde, so as to place him in the highest
            position. I need not give the names of the Regidores, for it is no use naming only a few
            of them ; but I must mention the fact that a pillory was placed in the Plaza and a
            gallows set up outside the town. We chose Pedro de Alvarado as captain of ex- peditions
            and Cristobal de Olid as Maestro de Campo.^ Juan de Escalante was chosen chief Alguacil
            f Gonzalo Mejia, treasurer, and Alonzo de Ãvila accountant. A certain Corral was named
            as Ensign, because Villaroel who had been Ensign was dismissed from the post on account
            of some offence (I do not exactly know what) he had given Cortes about an Indian woman
            from Cuba. Ochoa, a Biscayan, and Alonzo Romero were appointed Alguaciles of the Camp.*
            It will be said that I have made no mention of the Captain Gonzalo de Sandoval, he of
            whom our lord the Emperor has heard such reports, who was such a renowned captain that
            he ranked next to Cortes* in our estimation. I say this was because at that time he was
            a youth, and we did not take such count of him and of other valiant captains until we
            saw him grow in worth in such a way that Cortes and all the soldiers held him in the
            same esteem as Cortes himself, as I shall tell later on. * Maestro de Campo=
            Quartermaster. * Alguacil Mayor = High Constable. ' Alguacil del Real = Constables and

            DISPUTES BETWEEN THE PARTISANS I must leave my story here and say that the historian,
            Gomara, states that he was told all that which he has written down. But I assert that
            these things happened as I have related them. Gomara is wrong in other things ,that he
            wrote because his informants did not give him .a true account. However good the style
            may be in which ! he tells the story, so that all may appear to be true, I j assert that
            all he says about this matter is wrong. I will drop the subject now and go on to tell
            how the party of Diego Velasquez tried to stop the election of Cortes as captain, and to
            insist on our returning to the Island of Cuba. CHAPTER XUn. How the party of Diego
            Velasquez tried to upset the powers we had given to Cortes, and what was done about it.
            When the partisans of Diego Velasquez realized the fact that we had chosen Cortes for
            our Captain and Chief Justice, and had founded a town and chosen the Alcaldes and
            Regidores, and appointed Pedro de Alvarado as cap- tain [of expeditions] and named the
            Alguacil Mayor and Maestro de Campo and had done all that I have narrated, they were
            angry and furious and they began to excite factions and meetings and to use abusive
            language about Cortes and those of us who had elected him, saying that it was not right
            to do these things unless all the captains and soldiers who had come on the expedition
            had been parties to it ; that Diego Velasquez had given Cortes no such powers, only
            authority to trade, and that we partisans of Cortes should take care that our insolence
            did not so increase as to bring us to blows. Then Cortes secretly told Juan de Escalante
            that we should make him pro- duce the instructions given him by Diego Velasquez. OF
            CORTfe AfÃ­D OF DIEGO VELÃSQUEZ. 1 59 Upon this Cortes drew them from his bosom and gave
            them to the King's scribe to read aloud. In these instruc- tions were the words : " As
            soon as you have gained all you can by trading, you will return," and the document was
            signed by Diego Velasquez and countersigned by his Secretary, Andres de Duero. We begged
            Cortes to cause this document to be attached to the deed recording the power we had
            given him, as well as the proclamation which he issued in the Island of Cuba. And this
            was done so that his Majesty in Spain should know that all that we did was done in his
            royal service, and that they should not bring against us anything but the truth ; and it
            was a good precaution, seeing how we were treated in Spain by Don Juan Rodriguez de
            Fonseca, Bishop of Burgos and Arch- bishop of Rosano (for such were his titles) who, we
            knew for certain, took steps to destroy us as I shall tell later on. After this was
            done, these same friends and dependents of Diego Velasquez returned to Cortes to say
            that it was not right that he should have been chosen Captain without their consent and
            that they did not wish to remain under his command, but to return at once to the Island
            of Cuba. Cortes replied that he would detain no one by force, and that to anyone who
            came to ask leave to return, he would willingly grant it, even although he were left
            alone. With this some of them were quieted, but not Juan Velasquez de Leon who was a
            relation of Diego Velasquez, and Diego de OrdÃ¡s^ and Escobar, whom we called the Page,
            for he had been brought up by Diego Velasquez, and Pedro Escudero and other friends of
            Diego Velasquez ; and it came to this, that they refused all obedience to Cortes. With
            our assistance, Cortes determined to make prisoners of Juan Velasquez de Leon, and Diego
            de OrdÃ¡s, and Escobar the Page, and Pedro Escudero and others whose names I do not
            remember, and we took care that the others should create no disturbance. These men re-
            l60 PEDRO DE ALVARADO SENT mained prisoners for some days, in chains and under guard. Ã
            I will go on to tell how Pedro de Alvarado made an expedition to a town in the
            neighbourhood. Here^ the chronicler, Gomara, in his history gives quite a wrong account
            of what happened, and whoever reads his history will see that his story is greatly
            exaggerated, had he been correctly informed he would have related what [really] took
            place. CHAPTER XLIV. How it was arranged to send Pedro de Alvarado inland to look for
            maize and other supplies and what else happened. When all that I have related had been
            settled and done with, it was arranged that Pedro de Alvarado should go inland to some
            towns which we had been told were near by and see what the country was like and bring
            back maize and some sort of supplies, for there was a great want of food in camp.
            Alvarado took one hundred soldiers with him, among them fifteen crossbowmen and six
            musketeers. More than half his soldiers were partisans of Diego Velas- quez. All Cortes'
            party remained with him for fear there should be any further disturbance or tricks
            played or any rising against him, until things became more settled. Alvarado went first
            to some small towns subject to another town called Cotastan,^ where the language of
            Culua was spoken. This name, Culua, in this country means the common language of the
            partisans of Mexico and Montezuma ; so that in all that country when Culua is mentioned,
            it means people vassal and subject to Mexico, and must be thus understood, just as we
            should speak of the Romans and their allies. > Cotaxtla. ON A FORAGING EXPEDITION. l6l
            When Pedro de Alvarado reached these towns he found that they had all been deserted that
            same day, and he found in the cues bodies of men and boys who had been sacrificed, and
            the walls and altars stained with blood and the hearts placed as offerings before the
            Idols. He also found the stones on which the sacrifices were made and the stone knives
            with which to open the chest so as to take out the heart Pedro de Alvarado said that he
            found most of the bodies without arms or legs, and that he was told by some Indians that
            they had been carried off to be eaten, and our soldiers were astounded at such great
            cruelty. I will not say any more of the number of sacrifiges, although we found the same
            thing in every town we afterwards entered, and I will go back to Pedro de Alvarado and
            say that he found the towns well provisioned but deserted that very day by their
            inhabitants, so that he could not find more than two Indians to carry maize, and each
            soldier had to load him- self with poultry and vegetables, and he returned to camp
            without doing any other damage (although he had good opportunity for doing it) because
            Cortes had given orders to that effect, so that there should be no repetition of what
            happened at Cozumel. We were pleased enough in camp even with the little food that had
            been brought, for all evils and hardships disappear when there is plenty to eat. Here it
            is that the historian, Gomara, says that Cortes went inland with four hundred soldiers.
            He was mis- informed, for the first to go was [Alvarado] as I have stated here, and no
            other. To go back to my story : As Cortes was most energetic in every direction, he
            managed to make friends with the partisans of Diego Velasquez, for, with that solvent of
            hardness, presents of gold from our store to some, and promises to others, he brought
            them over to his side, and M l62 THE SPANIARDS SET OUT took them out of prison ; all
            except Juan Velasquez de Leon and Diego de OrdÃ¡s, who were in irons on board ship.
            These, too, he let out of prison after a few days, and made good and true friends of
            them as will be seen further on, â ^and all through gold which is such a pacifier ! When
            everything had been settled, we arranged to go to the fortified town already mentioned
            by me, which was called Quiahuitztlan. The ships were to go to the rock and harbour
            which was opposite that town, about a league distant from it I remember that as we
            marched along the coast we killed a large fish which had been thrown up high and dry by
            the sea. When we arrived at the river where Vera Cruz is now situated^ we found the
            water to be deep, and we crossed over it in some broken canoes like troughs, and others
            crossed by swimming, or on rafts. Then we came on some towns subject to the large town
            named Cempoala, whence came the five Indians with the golden labrets, who I have already
            said came as messengers to Cortes at the sand dunes, and whom we called Lope luzios. We
            found some idol houses and places of sacrifice, and blood splashed about, and incense
            used for fumigation and other things belonging to the idols, and stones with which they
            made the sacrifices, and parrots' feathers and many paper books doubled together in
            folds like Spanish cloth ; but we found no Indians, they having already fled, for as
            they had never before seen men like us, nor horses, they were afraid. We slept there
            that night, and went without supper, and next day, leaving the coast, we continued our
            march inland towards the west, without knowing the road we were taking, and we came on
            some good meadows called savanas where deer were grazing, and Pedro de Alvarado rode
            after one on his sorrel mare and struck at it with his ^ The third site, now known as La
            Antigua, FOR THE TOWN OF QUIAHUITZTLAN. 1 63 lance and wounded it, but it got away into
            the woods and could not be caught. While this was happening we saw twelve Indians ap-
            proaching, inhabitants of the farms where we had passed the night. They came straight
            from their Cacique, and brought fowls and maize cakes, and they said to Cortes, through
            our interpreters, that their chief had sent the fowls for us to eat, and begged us to
            come to his town, which was, according to the signs they made, distant one sun's (that
            is one day's) march. Cortes thanked them and made much of them, and we continued our
            march and slept in another small town, where also many ' sacrifices had been made, but
            as my readers will be tired of hearing of the great number of Indian men and women whom
            we found sacrificed in all the towns and roads we passed, I shall go on with my story
            without stopping to say any more about them. They gave us supper at the little town and
            we learnt that the road to Quiahuitztlan, which I have already said is a fortress,
            passed by Cempoala. I will go on to say how we entered Cempoala. CHAPTER XLV. How we
            entered Cempoala, which at that time was a very fine town and what happened to us there.
            We slept at the little town where the twelve Indians I have mentioned had prepared
            quarters for us, and after being well informed about the road which we had to take to
            reach the town on the hill, very early in the morning we sent word to the Caciques of
            Cempoala that we were coming to their town and that we hoped they would approve. Cortes
            sent six of the Indians with this message M 2 164 CEMPOALA. and kept the other six as
            guides. He also ordered the guns, muskets and crossbows to be kept ready for use, and
            sent scouts on ahead on the look out, and the horsemen and all the rest of us were kept
            on the alert, and in this way we marched to within a league of the town. As we
            approached, twenty Indian chieftains came out to receive us in the name of the Cacique,
            and brought some cones made of the roses of the country with a delicious scent, which
            they gave to Cortes and those on horseback with every sign of friendliness, and they
            told Cortes that their Lord was awaiting us at our apartments, for, as he was a very
            stout and heavy man, he could not come out to receive us himself. Cortes thanked them
            and we continued our march, and as we got among the houses and saw what a large town it
            was, larger than any we had yet seen, we were struck with admiration. It looked like a
            garden with luxuriant vegetation, and the streets were so full of men and women who had
            come to see us, that we gave thanks to God at having discovered such a country. Our
            scouts, who were on horseback, reached a great plaza with courts, where they had
            prepared our quarters, and it seems that during the last few days they had been
            whitewashed and burnished, a thing they knew well how to do, and it seemed to one of the
            scouts that this white surface which shone so brightly must be silver and he came back
            at full speed to tell Cortes that the walls of the houses were made of silver ! Dona
            Marina and Aguilar said that it must be plaster or lime and we had a good laugh over the
            man^s silver and excitement and always afterwards we told him that everything white
            looked to him like silver. I will leave our jokes and say that we reached the buildings,
            and the fat Cacique came out to receive us in the court. He was so fat that I shall call
            him by this name ; and he made deep obeisance to Cortes and fumigated him, as is their
            custom, and Cortes embraced CEMPOALA. 165 him and we were lodged in fine and large
            apartments that held us all, and they gave us food and brought some baskets of plums
            which were very plentiful at that season, and maize cakes, and as we arrived ravenous
            and had not seen so much food for a long time, we called the town Villa Viciosa ; and
            others called it Sevilla. Cortes gave orders that none of the soldiers should leave the
            plaza and that on no account should they give any offence to the Indians. When the fat
            Cacique heard that we had finished eating he sent to tell Cortes that he wished to come
            and visit him ; and he came in company with a great number of Indian chieftains, all
            wearing large gold labrets and rich mantles. Cortes left his quarters to go out and meet
            them, and embraced the Cacique with great show of caressing and flattery, and the fat
            Cacique ordered a present to be brought which he had prepared, consisting of gold,
            jewels and cloths ; but although it did not amount to much and was of little value he
            ^aÃ­d to Cortes : " Lope luzio^ Lope luzioy accept this in good part ; if I had more I
            would give it to you ! *' I have already said that in the Totonac language Lope luzio
            means Senor or great lord. Cortes replied through Dofta Marina and Aguilar that he would
            pay for the gift in good works, and that if the Cacique would tell him what he wanted to
            be done that he would do it for them for we were the vassals of a great prince, the
            Emperor Don Carlos, who ruled over many kingdoms and countries, and had sent us to
            redress grievances and punish evil doers, and to put an end to human sacrifices. And he
            explained to them many things touching our holy religion. When the fat Cacique heard
            this, he sighed, and complained bitterly of the great Mon- tezuma and his governors
            saying that he had recently been brought under his yoke ; that all his golden jewels had
            been carried off, and he and his people were so grievously 166 CEMPOALA. oppressed, that
            they dared do nothing without Monte- zuma's orders, for he was the Lord over many cities
            and countries and ruled over countless vassals and armies of warriors. As Cortes knew
            that he could not attend at that time to the complaints which they made, he replied that
            he would see to it that they were relieved of their burdens, that he was now on the way
            to visit his AcaUs (for so they call the ships in the Indian language) and take up his
            residence and make his headquarters in the town of Quiahuitztlan, and that as soon as he
            was settled there he would consider the matter more thoroughly. To this the fat Cacique
            replied that he was quite satisfied that it should be so. The next morning we left
            Cempoala, and there were awaiting our orders over four hundred Indian carriers, who are
            here called tamenes who carry fifty pounds weight on their backs and march five leagues
            with it. When we saw so many Indians to carry burdens we rejoiced, as before this, those
            of us who had not brought Indians with us from Cuba had to carry knapsacks on our own
            backs. And only six or seven Cubans had been brought in the fleet, and not a great
            number as Gomara asserts. Dona Marina and Aguilar told us that in these parts in times
            of peace the Caciques are bound to furnish tamenes to carry burdens, as a matter of
            course, and from this time forward wherever we went we asked for Indians to carry loads.
            Cortes took leave of the fat Cacique, and on the following day we set out on our march
            and slept at a little town which had been deserted near to Quiahuitztlan, and the people
            of Cempoala brought us food. The historian, Gomara, says that Cortes remained many days
            in Cempoala and planned a league and rebellion against Montezuma, but he was not
            correctly informed, because, as I have said, we left Cempoala on the following morning,
            and where the ARRIVAL AT QUIAHUITZTLAN. 167 rebellion was planned and what was the
            reason of it, I will relate further on. I will pause here and go on to tell how we
            entered Quiahuitztlan. CHAPTER XLVI. How we entered Quiahuitztlan, which was a fortified
            town, and were peaceably received. The next day about ten o'clock we reached the
            fortified town called Quiahuitztlan, which stands amid great rocks and lofty cliffs and
            if there had been any resistance it would have been very difficult to capture it.
            Expecting that there would be fighting we kept a good formation with the artillery in
            front and marched up to the fortress in such a manner that if anything had happened we
            could have done our duty. At this time, Alonzo de Avila was acting as captain, and as he
            was arrogant and bad tempered, when a soldier named Hernando Alonzo de Villanueva failed
            to keep his place in the ranks, he gave him a thrust with a lance in his arm which
            maimed him ; and after this Hernando Alonzo de Villanueva was always called " El
            Manquillo."^ It will be said* that I am always turning aside to tell old stories, so I
            must leave off and go on to say that we went half way through the town without meeting a
            single Indian to speak to, at which we were very much surprised, for they had fled in
            fear that very day when they had seen us climbing up to their houses. When we had
            reached the top of the fortress in the plaza near by where they had their cues and great
            idol houses, we saw fifteen Indians awaiting us all clad in good mantles, and each one
            with a brasier in his hand ^ Â£1 Manquillo Â» the one armed or the maimed. l68 COMPLAINTS
            OF MONTEZUMA'S TYRANNY. containing incense, and they came to where Cortes was standing
            and fumigated him and all the soldiers who were standing near and with deep obeisances
            they asked pardon for not coming out to meet us, and assured us that we were welcome and
            asked us to rest. And they said that they had fled and kept out of the way until they
            could see what sort of things we were, for they were afraid of us and of our horses, but
            that night they v^ould order all the people to come back to the town. Cortes displayed
            much friendship toward them and told them many things about our holy religion ; this we
            were always in the habit of doing wherever we might go. And he told them that we were
            the vassals of our great Emperor, Don Carlos, and he gave them some green beads and
            other trifles from Spain, and they brought fowls and maize cakes. While we were talking,
            someone came to tell Cortes that the fat Cacique from Cempoala was coming in a litter
            carried on the shoulders of many Indian chief- tains. When the fat Cacique arrived he,
            together with the Cacique and chiefs of the town addressed Cortes, relating their many
            causes of complaint against Montezuma and telling him of his great power, and this they
            did with such sighs and tears that Cortes and those who were standing with him were
            moved to pity. Besides relating the way that they had been brought into subjection, they
            told us that every year many of their sons and daughters were demanded of them for
            sacrifice, and others for service in the houses and plantations of their conquerors ;
            and they made other complaints which were so numerous that I do not remember them all ;
            but they said that Montezuma's tax gatherers carried off" their wives and daughters if
            they were handsome and ravished them, and this they did throughout the land where the
            Totonac language was spoken, which contained over thirty towns. Cortes consoled them as
            well as he was able through our MEXICAN TAX GATHERERS. 1 69 interpreters and said he
            would help them all he could, and would prevent these robberies and offences, as it was
            for that our lord the Emperor had sent us to these parts, and that they should have no
            anxiety, for they would soon see what we would do in the matter ; and they seemed to
            gather some satisfaction from this assurance but their hearts were not eased on account
            of the great fear they had of the Mexicans. While this conversation was going on, some
            Indians from the town came in great haste to tell the Caciques who were talking to
            Cortes, that five Mexicans, who were Montezuma's tax gatherers, had just arrived. When
            they heard the news they turned pale and trembled with fear, and leaving Cortes alone
            they went off to receive the Mexicans, and in the shortest possible time they had decked
            a room with flowers, and had food cooked for the Mexicans to eat, and prepared plenty of
            cacao, which is the best thing they have to drink. When these five Indians entered the
            town, they came to the place where we were assembled, where were the houses of the
            Cacique and our quarters, and approaching us with the utmost assurance and arrogance,
            without speaking to Cortes or to any of us, they passed us by. Their cloaks and loin
            cloths were richly embroidered (for at that time they wore loin cloths), and their
            shining hair was gathered up as though tied on their heads, and each one was smelling
            the roses that he carried, and each had a crooked staff in his hand. Their Indian
            servants carried fly-whisks, and they were accompanied by many of the chief men of the
            other Totonac towns, who until they had shown them to their lodgings and brought them
            food of the best, never left them. As soon as they had dined they sent to summon the fat
            Cacique and the other chiefs, and scolded them for entertaining us in their houses, for
            now they would have to I 170 MEXICAN TAX GATHERERS. speak and deal with us which would
            not please their lord Montezuma ; for without his permission and orders they should not
            have sheltered us, nor given us presents of golden jewels, and on this subject they
            uttered many threats against the fat Cacique and the other chiefs and ordered them at
            once to provide twenty Indians, men and women, to appease their gods for the wrong that
            had been done. When he saw what was going on, Cortes asked our interpreters, Dofta
            Marina and JerÃ³nimo de Aguilar why the Caciques were so agitated since the arrival of
            those Indians, and who they were. Dofta Marina who under- stood full well what had
            happened, told him what was going on ; and then Cortes summoned the fat Cacique and the
            other chiefs, and asked them who these Indians were, and why they made such a fuss about
            them. They replied that they were the tax gatherers of the great Montezuma and that they
            had come to inquire why they had received us in their town without the permission of
            their lord, and that they now demanded twenty men and women to sacrifice to their god,
            Huichilobos, so that he would give them victory over us, for they [the tax gatherers]
            said that Montezuma had declared that he intended to capture and make slaves of us.
            Cortes reassured them and bade them have no fear for he was here with all of us in his
            company and that he would chastise them [the tax gatherers]. In the next chapter I will
            tell in full what was done about it. SEIZURE OF THE TAX GATHERERS. 171 CHAPTER XLVII.
            How Cortes ordered the five tax gatherers of Montezuma to be taken prisoners and gave
            out that from that time forward neither obedience nor tribute should be rendered to the
            Mexicans, and how the rebellion against Montezuma was started. As soon as Cortes
            understood what the chiefs were telling him, he said that he had already explained to
            them that our lord the King had sent him to chastise evil doers and that he would not
            permit either sacrifice or robbery, and that as these tax gatherers had made this
            demand, he ordered them to make prisoners of them at once and to hold them in custody
            until their lord Montezuma should be told the reason, namely, how they had come to rob
            them and carry off their wives and children as slaves and commit other violence. When
            the Caciques heard this they were thunderstruck at such daring. What !â to order the
            mes- sengers of the great Montezuma to be maltreated? They said that they were too much
            afraid, and did not dare to do it. But Cortes went on impressing on them that the
            messengers should be thrown into prison at once, and so it was done, and in such a way
            that with some long poles and collars (such as are in use among them) they secured them
            so that they could not escape, and they flogged one of them who would not allow himself
            to be bound. Then Cortes ordered all the Caciques to pay no more tribute or obedience to
            Montezuma, and to make proclamation to that effect in all their friendly and allied
            towns, and if any tax gatherers came to their other towns, to inform him of it, and he
            would send for them. So the news was known throughout that province, for the fat Cacique
            promptly sent messengers to spread the tidings* and the chiefs who had come in company
            with the tax gatherers, as soon as they had seen them taken prisoners, 172 CORTÃS
            SECRETLY RELEASES noised it abroad, for each one returned to his own town to deliver the
            order and relate what had happened. When they witnessed deeds so marvellous and of such
            importance to themselves they said that no human beings would dare to do such things,
            and that it was the work of Teules, for so they call the idols which they worship, and
            for this reason from that time forth, they called us Teules, which, as I have already
            explained, is as much as to say that we were either gods or demons. When in the course
            of my story I may use the word Teule in matters connected with our persons, let it be
            understood that we (Spaniards) are meant I must go back to tell about the prisoners. It
            was the advice of all the Caciques that they should be sacrificed so that none of them
            could return to Mexico to tell the story; but when Cortes heard this he said that they
            should not be killed, and that he would take charge of them, and he set some of our
            soldiers to guard them. At midnight, Cortes sent for these soldiers who were in charge
            and said to them : " See to it that two of the prisoners are loosened [the two] that
            appear to you the most intelligent, in such a way that the Indians of this town shall
            know nothing about it." And he told them to bring the prisoners to his lodging. When the
            prisoners came before him, he asked them through our interpreters why they were
            prisoners and what country they came from, as though he knew nothing about them. They
            replied that the Caciques of Cempoala and of this town, with the aid of their followers
            and ours, had imprisoned them, and Cortes answered that he knew nothing about it, and
            was sorry for it, and he ordered food to be brought them and talked in a very friendly
            manner to them, and told them to return at once to their lord Montezuma and tell him
            that we were all his good friends and entirely at his service, and that lest any harm
            should happen to them he had taken them from their prison, and THE MEXICAN TAX
            GATHERERS. 173 had quarrelled with the Caciques who had seized them and that anything he
            could do to serve them he would do with the greatest good will, and that he would order
            the three Indians their companions who were still held prisoners to be freed and
            protected. That they two should go away at once and not turn back to be captured and
            killed. The two prisoners replied that they valued his mercy and said they still had
            fear of falling into the hands of their enemies, as they were obliged to pass through
            their territory. So Cortes ordered six sailors to take them in a boat during the night a
            distance of four leagues and set them on friendly ground beyond the frontier of
            Cempoala. When the morning came and the Caciques of the town and the fat Cacique found
            that the two prisoners were missing they were all the more intent on sacrificing those
            that remained, if Cortes had not put it out of their power and pretended to be enraged
            at the loss of the two who had escaped. He ordered a chain to be brought from the ships
            and bound the prisoners to it, and then ordered them to be taken on board ship, saying
            that he himself would guard them, as such bad watch had been kept over the others. When
            they were once on board he ordered them to be freed from their chains and with friendly
            words he told them that he would soon send them back to Mexico. I must leave this
            subject and say that when this was done, all the Caciques of this town and of Cempoala,
            and all the other Totonac chiefs who had assembled, asked Cortes what was to be done,
            and that all the force of the great Montezuma and of Mexico would descend upon them and
            they could not escape death and destruction. Cortes replied with the most cheerful
            countenance that he and his brothers who were here with him would defend them and would
            kill anyone who wished to molest them. Then the. Caciques and other townsmen vowed one
            and all 174 THE TOTONAC ALLIANCE. that they would stand by us in everything we ordered
            them to do and would join their forces [with ours] against Montezuma and all his aHies.
            Then, in the presence of Diego de Godoy, the scribe, they pledged obedience to his
            Majesty and messengers were sent to relate all that had happened to the other towns in
            that province. And as they no longer paid any tribute and no more tax gatherers appeared
            there was no end to the rejoicing at being rid of that tyranny. Now, I will leave this
            incident and tell how we agreed to descend to the plain to some fields where we began to
            build a fort. This is what really took place and not the story that was told to the
            historian Gomara.^ CHAPTER XLVIII. How we determined to found " La Villa Rica de la Vera
            Cniz" and to build a fort in some meadows near the salt marshes, and close to the
            harbour with the ugly name [Bernal] where our ships were at anchor, and what we did
            there. As soon as we had made this federation and friendship with more than twenty of
            the hill towns, known as [the towns of] the Totonacs, which at this time rebelled
            against the great Montezuma, and gave their allegiance to His Majesty, and offered to
            serve us â we determined with their ready help at once to found the Villa Rica de la
            Vera Cruz on a plain half a league from this fortress-like town, called Quiahuitztlan,
            and we laid out plans of a church, market- place and arsenals, and all those things that
            are needed for a town, and we built a fort, and from the laying of the foundations until
            the walls were high enough to receive ^ Blotted out in the original MS. " No matter how
            eloquently he may relate it."â G. G. THE BUILDING OF VILLA RICA. 175 the woodwork,
            loopholes, watch-towers, and barbicans, we worked with the greatest haste. Cortes
            himself was the first to set to work to carry out the earth and stone on his back, and
            to dig foundations, and all his captains and soldiers followed his example ; and we kept
            on labouring [without pause] so as to finish the work quickly, some of us digging
            foundations and others building walls,^ carrying water, working in the lime kilns,
            making bricks and tiles, or seeking for food. Others worked at the timber, and the
            blacksmiths, for we had two blacksmiths with us, made nails. In this way we all laboured
            without ceasing, from the highest to the lowest ; the Indians helping us, so that the
            church and some of the houses were soon built and the fort almost finished. While we
            were thus at work, it seems that the great Montezuma heard the news in Mexico about the
            capture of his tax gatherers and the rebellion against his rule, and how the Totonac
            towns had withdrawn their allegiance and risen in revolt. He showed much anger against
            Cortes and all of us, and had already ordered a great army of warriors to make war on
            the people who had rebelled against him, and not to leave a single one of them alive. He
            was also getting ready to come against us with a great army with many companies. Just at
            this moment there arrived two Indian prisoners whom Cortes had ordered to be set free,
            as I have related in the last chapter, and when Montezuma knew that it was Cortes who
            had taken them out of prison and had sent them to Mexico, â and when he heard the words
            and promises which he had sent them to report, it pleased our Lord God that his anger
            was appeased, and he resolved to send and gather news of us. For this purpose he
            despatched his two young nephews under the charge of four old men ^ Tapias Â« walls made
            of earth stamped into a mould. 176 AN EMBASSY FROM MONTEZUMA. who were Caciques of high
            rank, and sent with them a present of gold and cloth, and told his messengers to give
            thanks to Cortes for freeing his servants. On the other hand, he sent many complaints,
            saying that it was owing to our protection that those towns had dared to commit such a
            great treason as to refuse to pay him tribute and to renounce their allegiance to him,
            and that now, having respect for what he knew to be true â that we were those whom his
            ancestors had foretold were to come to their country, and must therefore be of his own
            lineage, how was it that we were living in the houses of these traitors ? He did not at
            once send to destroy them, but the time would come when they would not brag of such acts
            of treason. Cortes accepted the gold and the cloth, which was worth more than two
            thousand dollars, and he embraced the envoys and gave as an excuse that he and all of us
            were very good friends of the Lord Montezuma, and that it was as his servant that he
            still kept guard over the three tax gatherers, and he sent at once to have them brought
            from the ships â where they had been well treated and well clothed, and he delivered
            them up to the messengers. Then Cortes, on his part, complained greatly of Monte- zuma,
            and told the envoys how the Governor, Pitalpitoque, had left the camp one night without
            giving him notice, which was not well done and that he believed and felt certain that
            the Lord Montezuma had not authorized any such meanness, and that it was on account of
            this that we had come to these towns where we were now residing and where we had been
            well treated by the inhabitants. And he prayed him to pardon the disrespect of which the
            people had been guilty. As to what he said about the people no longer paying tribute,
            they could not serve two masters and during the time we had been there they had rendered
            service to us in the name of our Lord and King ; but AN EMBASSY FROM MONTEZUMA. 1 77 as
            he, Cortes, and all his brethren were on their way to visit him, and place themselves at
            his service, that when we were once there, then his commands would be attended to. When
            this conversation and more of the same nature was over, Cortes ordered blue and green
            glass beads to be given to the two youths, who were Caciques of high rank, and to the
            four old men who had come in charge of them, who were also chieftains of importance, and
            paid them every sign of honour. And as there were some good meadows in the
            neighbourhood, Cortes ordered Pedro de Alvarado who had a good and very handy sorrel
            mare, and some of the other horsemen, to gallop and skirmish before the Caciques, who
            were delighted at the sight of their galloping, and they then took leave of Cortes and
            of all of us well contented, and returned to Mexico. About this time Cortes* horse died,
            and he bought or was given another called " El Arriero," a dark chestnut which belonged
            to Ortiz, the musician, and BartolomÃ© Garcia, the miner ; it was one of the best of the
            horses that came in the fleet. I must stop talking about this, and relate that as these
            towns of the sierra, our allies, and the town of Cempoala had hitherto been very much
            afraid of the Mexicans, believing that the great Montezuma would send his great army of
            warriors to destroy them, when they saw the kinsmen of the great Montezuma arriving with
            the presents I have mentioned, and paying such marked respect to Cortes and to all of
            us, they were fairly astounded and the Caciques said to one another that we must be
            Teules for Montezuma had fear of us, and had sent us presents of ^ gold. If we already
            had reputation for valour, from this time forth it was greatly increased. But I must
            leave off here and go on to say what the fat Cacique and his friends were about. 178 THE
            TOTONACS BEG FOR HELP CHAPTER XLIX. How the hX Cacique and other chieftains came to
            complain to Cortes, that in a fortified town named Cingapacinga,^ there was a garrison
            of Mexicans which did them much damage, and what was done about it. As soon as the
            Mexican messengers had departed, the fat Cacique with many other friendly chieftains,
            came to beg Cortes to go at once to a town named Cingapacinga, two days' journey from
            Cempoala (that is about eight or nine leagues)â as there were many warriors of the
            Culuas, or Mexicans, assembled there, who were destroying their crops and plantations,
            and were waylaying and ill-treating their vassals, and doing other injuries. Cortes
            believed the story as they told it so earnestly. He had promised that he would help
            them, and would destroy the Culuas and other Indians who might annoy them, and noting
            with what importunity they pressed their complaints, he did not know what to answer
            them, unless it were to say that he would willingly go, or send some soldiers under one
            of us, to turn these Mexicans out. As he stood there thinking the matter over, he said
            laughingly to some of us companions who were with him : " Do you know, gentle- men, that
            it seems to me that we have already gained a great reputation for valour throughout this
            country and that from what they saw us do in the matter of Montezuma's tax-gatherers,
            the people here take us for gods or beings like their idols. I am thinking that so as to
            make them believe that one of us is enough to defeat those Indian warriors, their
            enemies, who they say are occupying the town with the fortress, that we will send
            Heredia against * Not marked on the modern maps. Orozco y Berra (vol. iv, p. 163) says
            that it no longer exists, but that he found it marked in a MS. map of Patino under the
            name of Tizapanecingo, eight or nine leagues N.W. of Cempoala, AGAINST THEIR ENEMIES.
            179 them/* Now, this old man was a Biscayan musketeer who had a bad twitch in his face,
            a big beard, a face covered with scars, and was blind of one eye and lame of one leg.
            Cortes sent for him and said : " Go with these Caciques to the river which is a quarter
            of a league distant, and when you get there, stop to drink and wash your hands, and fire
            a shot from your musket, and then I will send to call you back. I want this to be done
            because the people here think that we are gods, or at least they have given us that name
            and reputation, and as you are ugly enough, they will believe that you are an idol."
            Heredia did what he was told, for he was an intelligent and clever man who had been a
            soldier in Italy, and Cortes sent for the fat Cacique and the other chieftains, who were
            waiting for his help and assistance, and said to them : " I am sending this brother of
            mine with you to kill or expel all the Culuas from this town you speak of, and to bring
            me here as prisoners all who refuse to leave." The Caciques were surprised when they
            heard this and did not know whether to believe it or not, but seeing that Cortes never
            changed his face, they believed that what he told them was true. So old Heredia
            shouldered his musket and set out with them, and he fired shots into the air as he went
            through the forest so that the Indians might see and hear him. And the Caciques sent
            word to the other towns that they were bringing along a Teule to kill all the Mexicans
            who were in Cingapacinga. I tell this story here merely as a laughable incident, and to
            show the wiles of Cortes. When Cortes knew that Heredia had reached the river that he
            had been told about, he sent in haste to call him back, and when old Heredia and the
            Caciques had returned, he told them that on account of the good will he bore them that
            he, Cortes himself, would go in person with some of his brethren to afford them the help
            they needed and visit the country, and fortresses ; and he ordered them N 2 l8o SOME OF
            THE SPANIARDS at once to bring one hundred Indian carriers to transport the tepusques,
            that is, the cannon, and they came early the next morning, and we set out that same day
            with four hundred men and fourteen horsemen, and crossbowmen and musketeers who were all
            ready. Certain soldiers belonging to the party of Diego Velasquez refused to go and told
            Cortes that he could set out with those who were willing, but that they wished to go
            back to Cuba. What was done about this I will tell in the next chapter. CHAPTER L. How
            certain soldiers, partisans of Diego Velasquez, seeing tliat we positively intended to
            make settlements, and establish peace in the towns, said that they did not want to go on
            any expedition, but wished to return to the Island of Cuba. You have already heard me
            tell in the preceding chapter how Cortes had undertaken to go to a town named
            Cingapacinga, and take with him four hundred soldiers and fourteen horsemen and
            musketeers and crossbowmen, and we took good care to make certain soldiers of the party
            of Diego Velasquez go with us. When the officers went to warn them to get their arms
            ready, and those who had them to bring their horses, they answered haughtily that they
            did not want to go on any expedition but back to their farms and estates in Cuba ; that
            they had already lost enough through Cortes having enticed them from their homes, and
            that he had promised them on the sand dunes that whosoever might wish to leave, that he
            would give them permission to do so and a ship and stores for the voyage ; and for that
            reason there were now seven soldiers all ready to return to Cuba. When Cortes heard this
            he sent to summon these men before him, and when he asked them why they were doing such
            a mean thing they replied WISH to RETURN TO CUBA. l8l somewhat indignantly and said that
            they wondered at his honour, with so few soldiers under his command, wishing to settle
            in a place where there were reported to be such thousands of Indians and such great
            towns ; that as for themselves, they were invalids and could hardly crawl from one place
            to another and that they wished to return to their homes and estates in Cuba, and they
            asked him to grant them leave to depart as he had promised that he would do. Cortes
            answered them gently that it was true that he had promised it, but that they were not
            doing their duty in deserting from their captain's flag. And then he ordered them to
            embark at once without any delay and assigned a ship to them and ordered them to be
            furnished with cassava bread and a jar of oil and such other supplies as we possessed.
            One of these soldiers, a certain Moron, a native of the town of Bayamo, owned a good
            dappled (gray) horse, with stockinged fore- feet, and he sold it a good bargain to Juan
            Ruano in exchange for some property which Juan Ruano had left in Cuba. When these people
            were ready to set sail, all of us comrades, and the Alcaldes and Regidores of our town
            of Villa Rica, went and begged Cortes on no account to allow anyone to leave the
            country, for, in the interest of the service of our Lord God and His Majesty, any person
            asking for such permission should be considered as de- serving the punishment of death,
            in accordance with military law, as a deserter from his captain and his flag in time of
            war and peril, especially in this case when, as they had stated, we were surrounded by
            such a great number of towns peopled by Indian warriors. Cortes acted as though he
            wished to give them leave to depart, but in the end he revoked the permission and they
            remained baffled, and even ashamed of themselves ; however Moron had sold his horse and
            Juan Ruano, who 1 82 THE EXPEDITION had possession of it, did not want to give it back
            again ; but Cortes arranged all this and we set out on our expedi- tion to Cingapacinga.
            CHAPTER LI. What happened to us at Cingapacinga, and how, on our return by way of
            Cempoala, we demolished the idols ; and other things that happened. As soon as the seven
            men who wished to return to Cuba had calmed down, we set out with the force of horsemen
            and foot soldiers already mentioned, and slept that night at the town of Cempoala. Two
            thousand Indian warriors divided into four commands, were all ready to accompany . us,
            and on the first day we marched five leagues in good order. The next day, a little after
            dusk^ we arrived at some farms near to the town of Cingapacinga, and the natives of the
            town heard the news of our coming. When we had already begun the ascent to the fortress
            and houses which stood amid great cliffs and crags, eight Indian chieftains and priests
            came out to meet us peacefully and asked Cortes with tears, why he wished to kill and
            destroy them when they had done nothing to deserve it ; that we had the reputation of
            doing good to all and of relieving those who had been robbed, and we had imprisoned the
            tax gatherers of Montezuma ; that these Cempoala Indians who accompanied us were hostile
            to them on account of old enmities over the land claims and boundaries, and under our
            protection they had come to kill and rob them. It was true, they said, that there was
            formerly a Mexican garrison in the town, but that they had left for their own country a
            few days earlier when they heard that we had ^ A poco mas de Visperas. TO CINGAPACINGA.
            1 83 taken the other tax gatherers prisoners, and they prayed us not to let the matter
            go any further, but to grant them protection. When Cortes thoroughly understood what
            they had said through our interpreters, Dofia Marina and Aguilar, without delay he
            ordered Captain Pedro de Alvarado, and the quartermaster CristovÃ³l de Olid, and all of
            us comrades who were with him, to restrain the Indians of Cempoala and prevent them from
            advancing ; and this we did. But although we made haste to stop them, they had already
            begun to loot the farms. This made Cortes very angry and he sent for the captains who
            had command of the Cempoala warriors, and with angry words and serious threats, he
            ordered them to bring the Indian men and women and cloths and poultry that they had
            stolen from the farms, and forbade any Cempoala Indian to enter the town, and said that
            for having lied and for having come under our protection merely to rob and sacrifice
            their neighbours, they were deserving of death, and that our Lord and King, whose
            servants we were, had not sent us to these countries to commit such indignities, and
            that they should keep their eyes wide open in order that such a thing did not happen
            again, otherwise he would not leave one of them alive. Then the Caciques and captains of
            the Cempoalans brought to Cortes everything they had seized, both Indian men and women
            and poultry, and he gave them all back to their owners and with a face full of wrath he
            turned [to the Cempoalans] and ordered them to retire and sleep in the fields â and this
            they did. When the caciques and priests^ of that town saw how just we were [in our
            dealings] and heard the affectionate words that Cortes spoke to them through our
            interpreters, including matters concerning our holy religion which it was always our
            custom to explain, and his advice to them * Papas. 184 A Looter pÃºNÃ­sHEt). to give up
            human sacrifices and robbing one another, and the filthy practice of sodomy, and the
            worship of their cursed Idols, and much other good counsel which he gave them, they
            showed such good will towards us that they at once sent to call together the people of
            the neighbouring towns, and all gave their fealty to his Majesty. They soon began to
            utter many complaints against Montezuma, just as the people of Cempoala had done when we
            were at the town of Quiahuitztlan. On the next morning Cortes sent to summon the
            captains and caciques of Cempoala, who were waiting in the fields to know what we should
            order them to do, and still in terror of Cortes on account of the lies they had told
            him. When they came before him he made them make friends with the people of the town, a
            pact which was never broken by any of them. Then we set out for Cempoala by another road
            and passed through two towns friendly to Cingapacinga, where we rested, for the sun was
            very hot and we were wearied with carrying our arms on our backs. A soldier, (a some-
            thing) de Mora, a native of Ciudad-Rodrigo, took two chickens from an Indian house in
            one of the towns, and Cortes who happened to see it, was so enraged at that soldier for
            stealing chickens in a friendly town before his very eyes, that he immediately ordered a
            halter to be put around his neck, and he would have been hanged there if Pedro de
            Alvarado, who chanced to be near Cortes, had not cut the halter with his sword when the
            poor soldier was half dead. I call this story to mind here to show my curious readers,
            and even the priests who nowadays have charge of administering the holy sacraments and
            teaching the doctrine to the natives of the country, that because the poor soldier stole
            two fowls in a friendly town, it nearly cost him his life, so that they can see how one
            ought to act towards the Indians, and not seize their GIFTS OF INDIAN MAIDENS. 185
            property. This same soldier was killed later on in a battle fought on a rocky height in
            the province of Guatemala. To go on with my story â when we had left those towns in
            peace and continued our march towards Cempoala, we met the fat cacique and other chiefs
            waiting for us in some huts with food, for although they were Indians, they saw and
            understood that justice is good and sacred, and that the words Cortes had spoken to
            them, that we had come to right wrongs and abolish tyranny, were in conformity with what
            had happened on that expedition, and they were better aflfected towards us than ever
            before. We slept the night in those huts, and all the caciques bore us company all the
            way to our quarters in their town. They were really anxious that we should not leave
            their country, as they were fearful that Montezuma would send his warriors against them,
            and they said to Cortes that as we were already their friends, they would like to have
            us for brothers, and that it would be well that we should take from their daughters, so
            as to have children by them ; and to cement our friendship, they brought eight damsels,
            all of them daughters of caciques, and gave one of these cacicas, who was the niece of
            the fat cacique, to Cortes ; and one, who was the daughter of another great cacique,
            (called Cuesco in their language,) was given to Alonzo Hernandez Puertocarrero. All
            eight of them were clothed in the rich garments of the country, beautifully ornamented
            as is their custom. Each one of them had a golden collar around her neck and golden
            ear-rings in her ears, and they came accompanied by other Indian girls who were to serve
            as their maids. When the fat cacique presented them, Jie said to Cortes : " Tecle,
            (which in their language means Lord) â these seven women are for your captains, and this
            one, who is my niece, is for you, and she is the senora of towns and vassals." Cortes
            received them with a cheerful countenance and thanked the caciques for the gift, but he
            1 86 THE SPANIARDS DETERMINE said that before we could accept them and become brothers,
            they must get rid of those idols which they believed in and worshipped, and which kept
            them in darkness, and must no longer offer sacrifices to them, and that when he could
            see those cursed things thrown to the ground and an end put to sacrifices that then our
            bonds of brotherhood would be most firmly tied. He added that these damsels must become
            Christians before we could receive them, and the people must free themselves from
            sodomy, for there were boys dressed like women who went about for gain by that cursed
            practice, and every day we saw sacrificed before us three, four or five Indians whose
            hearts were offered to the idols and their blood plastered on the walls, and the feet,
            arms and legs of the victims were cut off and eaten, just as in our country we eat beef
            brought from the butchers. I even believe that they sell it by retail in the tianguez^
            as they call their markets. Cortes told them that if they gave up these evil deeds and
            no longer practiced them, not only would we be their friends, but we would make them
            lords over other provinces. All the caciques, priests, and chiefs replied that it did
            not seem to them good to give up their idols and sacrifices and that these gods of
            theirs gave them health and good harvests and everything of which they had need ; and
            that as for sodomy, measures would be taken to put a stop to it so that it should no
            longer be practiced. When Cortes and all of us who had seen so many cruelties and
            infamies which I have mentioned heard that ' disrespectful answer, we could not stand
            it, and Cortes spoke to us about it and reminded us of certain good and holy doctrines
            and said : ** How can we ever accomplish anything worth doing if for the honour of God
            we do not first abolish these sacrifices made to idols ?" and he told us ^ Tianguiz or
            Tianguiztli. TO DESTROY THE INDIAN IDOLS. 1 87 to be all ready to fight should the
            Indians try to prevent us ; but even if it cost us our lives the idols must come to the
            ground that very day. We were all armed ready for a fight as it was ever our custom to
            be so, and Cortes told the caciques that the idols must be overthrown. When they saw
            that we were in earnest, the fat cacique and his captains told all the warriors to get
            ready to defend their idols, and when they saw that we intended to ascend a lofty cue â
            which was their temple â which stood high and was approached by many steps, â I cannot
            remember how many (steps there were) â the fat cacique and the other chieftains were
            beside themselves with fury and called out to Cortes to know why he wanted to destroy
            their idols, for if we dishonoured them and overthrew them, that they would all perish
            and we along with them. Cortes answered them in an angry tone, that he had already told
            them that they should offer no more sacrifices to those evil images ; that our reason
            for removing them was that they should no longer be deluded, and that either they,
            themselves, must remove the idols at once, or we should throw them out and roll them
            down the steps, and he added that we were no longer their friends but their mortal
            enemies, for he had given them good advice which they would not believe ; besides he had
            seen their companies come armed for battle and he was angry with them and would make
            them pay for it by taking their lives. When the Indians saw Cortes uttering these
            threats, and our interpreter Dona Marina knew well how to make them understood, and even
            threatened them with the power of Montezuma which might fall on them any day, out of
            fear of all this they replied that they were not worthy to approach their gods, and that
            if we wished to overthrow them it was not with their consent, but that we could
            overthrow them and do what we chose. The words were hardly out of their mouths before
            more l88 THE IDOLS OVERTURNEa than fifty of us soldiers had clambered up [to the temple]
            and had thrown down their idols which came rolling down the steps shattered to pieces.
            The idols looked like fear- some dragons, as big as calves, and there were other figures
            . half men and half great dogs of hideous appearance. When they saw their idols broken
            to pieces the caciques and â¢priests who were with them wept and covered their eyes^ and
            in the Totonac tongue they prayed their gods to pardon them, saying that the matter was
            no longer in their hands and they were not to blame, but these Teules who had overthrown
            them, and that they did not attack us on account of the fear of the Mexicans. When this
            was over the captains of the Indian warriors who, as 1 have said, had come ready to
            attack us, began to prepare to shoot arrows at us, and when we saw this, we laid our
            hands on the fat cacique and the six priests and some other chiefs, and Cortes cried out
            that on the least sign of hostility they would all be killed. Then the fat cacique
            commanded his men to retire from our front and not attempt to fight, and when Cortes saw
            them calmed, he niade them a speech which I will record later on, and thus they were all
            pacified. This affair of Cingapacinga was the first expedition made by Cortes in New
            Spain, and it was very successful, and we did not, as the historian GÃ³mara says, kill
            and capture and destroy thousands of men in this affair at Cingapacinga, and he who
            reads this can see how far one story differs from the other, and however good the style
            of his history may be, nothing is set down as it really happened. DESCRIPTION OF THE
            PRIESTS OF THE IDOLS. 1 89 CHAPTER LII. How Cortes had an altar made and set up an image
            of Our Lady and a Cross, and how mass was said and the eight Indian damsels were
            baptized. When the Caciques, priests and chieftains were silenced, Cortes ordered all
            the idols which we had overthrown and broken to pieces to be taken out of sight and
            burned. Then eight priests who had charge of the idols came out of a chamber and carried
            them back to the house whence they had come, and burned them. These priests wore black
            cloaks like cassocks and long gowns reaching to their feet, and some had hoods like
            those worn by canons, and others had smaller hoods like those worn by Domini- cans, and
            they wore their hair very long, down to the waist, with some even reaching down to the
            feet, covered with blood and so matted together that it could not be separated, and
            their ears were cut to pieces by way of sacrifice, and they stank like sulphur, and they
            had another bad smell like carrion, and as they said, and we learnt that it was true,
            these priests were the sons of chiefs and they abstained from women, but they indulged
            in the cursed practice of sodomy, and they fasted on certain day?, and what I saw them
            eat was the pith or seeds of cotton when the cotton was being cleaned, but they may have
            eaten other things which I did not see. Let us leave the priests and go back to Cortes
            who made them a good speech through our interpreters, Dofia Marina and JerÃ³nimo de
            Aguilar, and told them that now we would treat them as brothers and would help them all
            we could against Montezuma and his Mexicans, and we had already sent to tell him not to
            make war on them or levy tribute, and that as now they were not to have any more idols
            in their lofty temples he wished to leave with them IpO THE HEATHEN TEMPLES ARE
            PURIFIED. a great lady who was the Mother of our Lord Jesus Christ whom we believe in
            and worship, and that they too should hold her for Lady and intercessor, and about this
            matter and others which were mentioned he made them an excel- lent discourse, so
            concisely reasoned, considering the time at his disposal, that there was nothing left to
            be said. He told them many things about our holy religion as well stated as only a
            priest could do it nowadays, so that it was listened to with good will. Then he ordered
            all the Indian mason^n the town to bring plenty of lime so as to clean the place and he
            told them to clear away the blood which encrusted the cues and to clean them thoroughly.
            The next day when they were whitewashed, an altar was set up with very good altar cloths
            and he told the Indians to bring many of the roses which grew in the country and are
            very sweet-scented, and branches of flowers, and told the people to adorn the altar with
            garlands and always keep the place swept and clean. He then ordered four of the priests
            to have their hair shorn, for, as I have already said, they wore it long, and to change
            their garments and clothe themselves in white, and always keep themselves clean, and he
            placed them in charge of the altar and of that sacred image of our Lady, with orders to
            keep the place swept clean and decked with flowers. So that it should be well looked
            after, he left there as hermit one of our soldiers named Juan de Torres de Cordoba, who
            was old and lame. He ordered our carpenters, whose names I have already given, to make a
            cross and place it on a stone support which we had already built and plastered over. The
            next morning, mass was celebrated at the altar by Padre Fray BartolomÃ© de Olmedo, and
            then an 'order was given to fumigate the holy image of Our Lady and the sacred cross
            with the incense of the country, and we showed them how to make candles of the native
            wax and ordered these candles always to be kept burning on the altar, for ALLOTMENT OF
            INDIAN MAIDENS. I9I up to that time they did not know how to use the wax. The most
            important chieftains of that town and of others who had come together, were present at
            the Mass. At the same time the eight Indian damsels were brought to be made Christians,
            for they were still in the charge of their parents and uncles and they were given to
            under- stand that they must not offer more sacrifices, nor worship idols, but believe in
            our Lord God. ^And they were admonished about many things touching our holy religion and
            were then baptized. The niece of the fat Cacique was named Dofta Catalina, and she was
            very ugly ; she was led by the hand and given to Cortes who received her and tried to
            look pleased. The daughter of the great Cacique, Cuesco, was named Dofta Francisca, she
            was very beautiful for an Indian, and Cortes gave her to Alonzo Hernandez Puertocarrero.
            I cannot now recall to mind the names of the other six, but I know that Cortes gave them
            to different soldiers. When this had been done, we took leave of all the Caciques and
            chieftains who from that time forward always showed us good will, especially when they
            saw that Cortes received their daughters and that we took them away with us, and after
            Cortes had repeated his promises of assistance [against their enemies] we set out for
            our town of Villa Rica. What happened there I will speak of later on. This, however, is
            the true account of what took place in the town of Cempoala, and differs from the
            stories told by GÃ³niara and the other historians which are all stuff and nonsense. 192
            VESSELS ARRIVE FROM CUBA. CHAPTER LIII. How we returned to Villa Rica de la Vera Cruz
            and what happened there. After we had finished our expedition and the people of Cempoala
            and Cingapacinga had been reconciled to one another, and the other neighbouring towns
            had given their fealty to His Majesty, and the idols had been overturned and the image
            of Our Lady and the Holy Cross set up in their place, and the old soldier placed in
            charge as hermit, and all the other things that I have told about had happened, we
            returned to our settlement and took with us certain chieftains from Cempoala. On the day
            of our arrival there came into port a ship from the Island of Cuba, under the command of
            Francisco de Saucedo, whom we called ElPulido} We called him this from his excessive
            pride in his good looks and elegance. They say that he was a native of Medina Rio Seco,
            and had been Maestre- sale?' to the Admiral of Castille. At the same time there arrived
            Luis Marin (a man of great merit who was afterwards a captain in the expedi- tion
            against Mexico) and ten soldiers. Saucedo brought a horse, and Luis Marin a mare ; and
            they brought from Cuba the news that the decree had reached Diego Velas- quez from Spain
            giving him authority to trade and found settlements, at which his friends were greatly
            rejoiced, all the more when they learned that he had received his com- mission
            appointing him Adelantado of Cuba. Being in that town without any plans beyond finishing
            the fort, for we were still at work on it, most of us soldiers suggested to Cortes to
            let the fort stand as it was, for a 1 The elegant. ' Maestresala^ the chief waiter at a

            be roofed), for we had already been over three months in the country and it seemed to us
            better to go and see what this great Monte- zuma might be like and to earn an honest
            living and make our fortune ; but that before we started on our journey we should send
            our salutations to His Majesty, the Emperor, and give him an account of all that had
            happened since we left the Island of Cuba. It also began to be debated whether we should
            send to His Majesty all the gold that we had received, both what we had got from barter,
            as well as the presents that Montezuma had sent us. Cortes replied that it was a very
            wise decision and that he had already talked to some of the gentlemen about it, and that
            as perchance in this matter of the gold there might be some soldiers who wished to keep
            their shares, and if it were divided up there would be very little to send, that for
            this reason he had appointed Diego de OrdÃ¡s and Francisco de Montejo who were good men
            of business, to go from soldier to soldier among those whom it was suspected would
            demand their share of the gold, and say these words : " Sirs, you already know that we
            wish to send His Majesty a present of the gold which we have obtained here, and as it is
            the first [treasure] that we are sending from this land it ought to be much greater ; it
            seems to us that we should all place at his service the portions that fall to our share.
            We gentlemen and soldiers who have here written our names have signed as not wishing to
            take anything, but to give it all voluntarily to His Majesty, so that he may bestow
            favours on us. If anyone wishes for his share it will not be refused him, but whoever
            renounces it let him do as we have all done, and sign here." In'this way they all signed
            to a man. When this was settled, Alonzo Hernandez Puertocarrero and Francisco de Montejo
            were chosen as proctors to go to Spain, for Cortes had already given them over two
            thousand dollars to keep O 194 LETTERS TO THE EMPEROR. them in his interest The best
            ship in the fleet was got ready, and two pilots were appointed, one of them being Anton
            de Alaminos, who knew the passage through the Bahama Channel, for he was the first man
            to sail through it, and fifteen sailors were told off, and a full supply of ship's
            stores given to them. When everything was ready, we agreed to write to tell His Majesty
            all that had happened. Cortes wrote on his own account, so he told us, an accurate
            narrative of the events, but we did not see his letter. The Cabildo' wrote a letter
            jointly with ten of the soldiers from among those who wished to settle in the land and
            had appointed Cortes as their general, and the letter was drawn up with great accuracy
            so that nothing was omitted, and I put my signature to it ; and besides these letters
            and narratives, all the captains and soldiers together wrote another letter and
            narrative, and what was contained in the letter which we wrote is as follows : CHAPTER
            LIV. The narrative and letter which we sent to His Majesty by our proctors, Alonzo
            Hernandez Puertocarrero and Francisco de Montejo, which letter was signed by a number of
            the Captains and soldiers. After beginning with the expressions of well deserved respect
            which were due from us to the great Majesty of the Emperor our Lord, for such his
            Cathoh'c Christian Royal Majesty was, and after adding other matters which it was
            appropriate to state in a narrative and account of our doings and voyage, each chapter
            by itself, there followed this, which I will here briefly recapitulate. How we sailed
            from 1 Cabildoâ Municipality, the alguaciles, etc., already mentioned. CONTENTS OF THE
            LETTER. 1 95 the Island of Cuba with Hernando Cortes ; and the pro- clamations which
            were made ; how we intended coming to settle, but that Diego Velasquez was secretly
            minded to trade and not to settle. How Cortes wished to return with certain gold gained
            by barter in accordance with the instructions that he brought from Diego Velasquez which
            we have submitted to His Majesty. How we insisted on Cortes forming a settlement, and
            chose him as Captain General and Chief Justice, until His Majesty might please to order
            otherwise. How we promised him [Cortes] the fifth of what should be obtained, after the
            Royal fifth had been deducted. How we arrived at Cozumel and by what chance JerÃ³nimo de
            Aguilar happened to be at Cape Catoche, and about the way he said that he got there, he
            and a certain Gonzalo Guerrero, who remained with the Indians because he was married and
            had children and had already become like an Indian. How we arrived at Tabasco, and of
            the war they waged against us, and the battle we fought with them, and how we brought
            them to peace. How that wherever we went excellent discourses were addressed to them
            [the Indians] to induce them to abandon their Idols, and matters concerning our Holy
            faith were explained to them. How they gave their fealty to His Royal Majesty, and
            became the first vassals that he has in these parts. How they [the Indians] brought a
            present of women, and among them a Cacica, for an Indian a woman of great importance,
            who knew the Mexican language, which is the language used throughout the country and
            that with her and Aguilar we possessed reliable interpreters. How we landed at San Juan
            de Uliia, and about the speeches of the Ambassadors of the Great Montezuma, and who the
            Great Montezuma was and what was said about his greatness, and about the present that
            they brought. How we went to Cempoala, which is a large town, and thence to another town
            named Quiahuitztlan, which is fortified, and how in O 2 196 CONTENTS OF THE LETTER that
            town an alliance and confederation was made with us and more than thirty towns withdrew
            their obedience from Montezuma, and all gave their fealty to His Majesty and are now
            part of his Royal possessions. The expedition to Cingapacinga, how we made a fortress,
            and that we are now on the road to the interior of the country to see Montezuma himself.
            How this country is very lai^e with many cities and thickly peopled and the natives are
            great warriors. How there is a great diversity of languages among them and they make war
            one against the other. How they are idolators and kill and sacrifice many men, women and
            children, and eat human flesh and practice other iniquities. How the first discoverer
            was Francisco Hernandez de Cordova, and Juan de Grijalva came soon after and that now at
            the present time we offer him [His Majesty] the gold that we have gained, that is, the
            golden sun and silver moon and a helmet full of gold in grains as they take it from the
            mines, many different kinds of golden articles shaped in various ways, and cotton cloths
            much embroidered with feathers, of great excellence, and many other golden objects such
            as fly whisks and shields, and other things which, as so many years have already gone
            by, I cannot now call to mind. We also present four Indians whom we liberated in
            Cempoala whom they had kept in wooden cages to fatten, so that when they were fat they
            might be sacrificed and eaten. After giving the report of this and other things, we gave
            an account and narration of how we, four hundred and fifty soldiers in these his
            Majesty's dominions, were placed in very great danger among such a great number of
            towns, and such quarrel- some people and such great warriors, in order to serve God and
            His Royal Crown, and we begged him to show us favour in all that we might need, and that
            he would not grant the government of these countries or crown offices to any person
            whatever, for they arc of such quality to THE EMÃ>EkÃft. tg^ and so rich with such great
            towns and cities, that they are suitable for an Infante or Great Lord, and we are
            thinking^ that as Don Juan Rodriguez de Fonseca, Bishop of Burgos and Archbishop of
            Rosano, is President of the Council and rules all the Indies, that he will give it [the
            government] to some relation of his own or to some friend, especially to one Diego
            Velasquez who is governor of the Island of Cuba, and the reason why he will give him the
            government or any other office, is that he [Diego Velasquez] is always giving him
            presents of gold and has set apart for him in this same island, townships of Indians to
            get out the gold from the mines, and from among these he ought first of all to have
            given the best to the Royal Crown, but he did not set aside one of them, and on this
            account he is not worthy to receive favours. As in all things, we are his [Majesty's]
            most loyal servants, and are ready to lay down our lives in his service, we inform him
            of this so that he may know all about it and we are determined that until he has deigned
            to permit our proctors, whom we are sending, to kiss his feet, and has seen our letter,
            and until we see his Royal signature (when prostrate we may obey his Royal commands),
            that should the Bishop of Burgos on his own authority send us any one soever to govern
            us or be our captain, then, before obeying him, we would bring it to His Majesty's
            personal knowledge wherever he may be, and that whatever he should order, that would we
            obey as we are bound to do, as the command of our King and Lord. Besides these
            narratives, we begged him, until he be pleased to order otherwise, to grant the
            government to Hernando Cortes, and we praised him so highly as his most obedient
            servant, as to raise him to the clouds, and after having written all these narratives
            with the greatest respect and humility as well as we were able and as was proper,
            explaining every event, how and when and icjÃ THE Proctors sail for spaIN. in what
            manner they happened, in the form of a letter intended for our King and not in the style
            that is here set down in my story, we captains and soldiers who were on the side of
            Cortes, all of us signed it. Two copies were made of the letter, and Cortes begged us to
            show them to him, and when he saw such a true narrative, and the great praise which we
            gave to him, he was very pleased and said that he would remember it to our credit and
            made us great promises, but he did not wish us to mention or allude to the fifth of the
            gold that we had promised him, nor to say who were the first discoverers, because, as we
            understood, he gave no account in his letter of Francisco Hernandez de Cordova nor of
            Grijalva, but attributed the discovery, and the honour and glory of it all, to himself
            alone, and he said that now at this time it would be better to write thus, and not to
            report it to His Majesty. There were not wanting those who said to him that to our King
            and Lord nothing that had happened should be left untold. When these letters had been
            written and given to our proctors, we impressed on them strongly, that on no account
            should they enter Havana or go to a farm which one of them, Francisco de Montejo, owned
            there, which was called E/ Marten and was a harbour for ships, lest Diego Velasquez
            should get to know what was happening. They did not do as they were told as I shall show
            later on. When everything was ready for them to embark, the Padre de la Merced said
            Mass, commending them to the guidance of the Holy Spirit. On the 26th July 1519 they
            left San Juan de Uliia and with good weather, arrived at Havana, and Francisco de
            Montejo with the greatest importunity allured and induced the pilot Alaminos to steer to
            his farm, saying that he was going to obtain supplies of pigs and cassava, until he got
            him to do what he wanted which was to drop anchor at his farm, for Puertocarrero was
            very ill and he (Montejo) paid THE SHIP TOUCHES AT HAVANA. I99 no attention to him, and
            on the very night they arrived they despatched a sailor from the ship by land with
            letters and information for Diego Velasquez, and we know that Montejo sent the man who
            went with the letters, and this sailor went post haste through the Island of Cuba, from
            town to town making known all that I have here told, until Diego Velasquez himself knew
            it, and what he did about it I will tell later on. CHAPTER LV. How Diego Velasquez, the
            Governor of Cuba, learned for certain from letters, that we were sending proctors with
            an embassy and presents to our King and Lord, and what he did about it. As Diego
            Velasquez the Governor of Cuba learnt the news both from the letters which were secretly
            sent him, (rumour said by Montejo) as well as from the sailor, who had been present
            during all that I have related in the last chapter, and who swam ashore to carry the
            letters to him, and when he understood about the great present of gold that we were
            sending to His Majesty, and knew who were the Ambas- sadors and proctors, he was taken
            with cold sweats as of death and uttered most lamentable words and curses against
            Cortes, and against his own secretary Duero, and the accountant Amador de Lares who had
            advised him to make Cortes a general, and he promptly ordered two ships of small burden
            which were fast sailors, to be armed with all the artillery and soldiers that could be
            provided and two captains, one named Gabriel de Rojas, and the other so and so de
            Guzman, to go in them and he ordered them to go as far as the Havana, and thence to the
            Bahama Channel and in any case to capture and bring the ship in which our proctors were
            sailing and all the gold that they were carrying. With all haste, in compliance with his
            commands, they arrived after some days of sailing at the 2O0 DIEGO VELASQUEZ HEAkS THE
            NEWS Bahama Channel, and asked of some of the vessels which were crossing the sea with
            cargo if they had seen a ship of large size go by and all gave news of her and said that
            she would already have passed out of the Bahama Channel, for they had had continuous
            good weather. So after beating about with those two ships between the Bahama Channel and
            the Havana and finding no news of what they came to seek they returned to Santiago de
            Cuba, and if Diego Velasquez was upset before he despatched the vessels, he was far more
            afflicted when he saw them return in this way, and his friends promptly advised him to
            send to Spain and complain to the Bishop of Burgos who was President of the Council of
            the Indies, and was doing much for him. He also sent his complaints to the Island of
            Santo Domingo to the Royal Audiencia which resided there and to the Jeronimite friars
            who were governors of the Island, named Fray Luis de Figuerea and Fray Alonzo de Santo
            Domingo and Fray Bernadino de Manzanedo, and these ecclesiastics were wont to stay and
            reside in the Mejorada Monastery two miles distant from Medina del Campo, and he sent a
            ship post haste to them to make many complaints against Cortes and all of us. When they
            came to know about our great services, the answer that the Jeronimite fathers gave him
            was that no blame could be laid on Cortes and those who went with him, for on all
            matters we turned to our King and Master, and we had sent him so great a present, such
            as had not been seen for a long time past in our Spain, and they said this because at
            that time and season no Peru existed nor any thought of it. They also sent to tell him
            that on the contrary we were worthy to receive the greatest favours from His Majesty ;
            at the same time they sent to Cuba a Licentiate named Zuazo to take the residencies of
            Diego ^ Residencia â that is the examination and formal account demanded of a person
            holding public office. AND PkÃPARES ANOtHER F*LEET. 2ÃÃ Velasquez, or at least he
            arrived at the Island a few months later, and this same Licentiate made his report to
            the / Jeronimite Friars. When that reply was brought to Diego /. Velasquez he was more
            dismayed than ever, and whereas before he was very stout he at this time became thin.
            With the greatest energy he at once ordered all the ships that could be found in the
            Island of Cuba to be searched out and soldiers and Captains to be got ready, and he took
            steps to send a* powerful fleet to take Cortes and all of us prisoners, and he showed
            such personal energy, going from town to town and from one estate to the other, writing
            to all parts of the Island where he was not able to go himself, and entreating his
            friends to go on that expedition, that within eleven months or a year he got together
            eighteen sail, great and small, and over thirteen hundred soldiers including captains
            and seamen, for as they saw that he was so zealous and prompt, all the principal
            inhabitants of Cuba, his relations as well as those who possessed Indians, got ready to
            serve him. He sent as Captain General of the Fleet a gentleman named PÃ¡nfilo de Narvaez,
            a man tall of stature and robust, whose | voice sounded hollow as if from a vault : he
            was a native! of Valladolid and married in the Island of Cuba a lady I who was already a
            widow, named Maria de Valenzuela and he owned good towns of Indians and was very rich.
            Here I will now leave him, forming and preparing his fleet, and will go back to our
            proctors and their good voyage, and as three or four things happened at the same time I
            must leave the story and subject which I was discussing, so as to be able to speak of
            that which is more material, and for this reason they must not blame me- because I set
            out and depart from the regular course of events in order to speak of what happened
            later on. 2Ã2 t)OK JUAN RODRÃGUEZ DE FONSECA CHAPTER LVI. How our Proctors passed
            through the Bahama Channel in good weather and in a short time arrived in Castille, and
            what hap- pened to them at Court. I HAVE already said that our Proctors left the port of
            San Juan de Uliia on the 6th July, 1519, and after a good passage they arrived at Havana
            and they soon passed through the Bahama Channel, and it is said that this was the first
            time that it was navigated, and in a short time they reach the Islands of Tercera^ and
            thence went to Seville. They journeyed post haste to the court which was at Valladolid
            and to the President of the Royal Council of the Indies, Don Juan Rodriguez de Fonseca,
            Bishop of Burgos (who styled himself Archbishop of Rosano), and ruled all the Court
            because our Lord the Emperor was absent in Flanders.^ When our proctors quite
            cheerfully, expecting that he would show them favour, went to kiss the hands of the
            President, and to give him our letters and narrative and deliver all the gold and
            jewels, and begged him to send a messenger at once to His Majesty to hand over to him
            the present and letters, with whom they themselves would go to kiss the Royal feet, he
            received them with such an evil frown and such ill will, and even spoke to them
            contemptuously because they had thus addressed him, that our ambassadors were about to
            retort. However, they restrained themselves and replied that his Lordship should
            consider the great services that Cortes and his companions were rendering to His Majesty
            and they again begged him at once to send all those golden jewels and the letters and
            narratives to His Majesty that he might know what had happened, and that they * Terceira
            in the Azores. 2 This IS an error ; Charles V was in Catalonia. REPRIMANDS tHE
            1>R0CT0RS. ÃOj would go to him. He retorted very haughtily and even ordered that they
            should not have charge of it [the letters and jewels] ; that he himself would write to
            say what was really happening, and not what they reported, for they had risen in
            rebellion against Diego Velasquez ; and many other bitter words passed between them. At
            this time Benito Martin, Chaplain to Diego Velas- quez, who has been already mentioned
            by me, arrived at Court, and made many complaints against Cortes and all of us, which
            still more incensed the Bishop against us. As Alonzo Hernandez Puertocarrero was a
            gentle- man and cousin of the Count de Medellin (for Montejo held back and did not dare
            to displease the President), he said to the Bishop that he appealed to him most
            earnestly to listen to them without passion, and not to utter such words as he had
            spoken, and at once to despatch those presents as they were brought for His Majesty ;
            that we were most faithful servants of the Royal Crown, and worthy of favours and not of
            insults and rude words. When the Bishop heard that, he ordered him to be arrested, for
            he was told that three years before, he [Alonzo Puertocarrero] had seized a woman of
            Medellin and carried her off to the Indies. So all our merits and presents of gold were
            in the position that I have here related, and our Ambassadors decided to hold their
            tongues until the right time and place should occur. The Bishop wrote to inlanders to
            his Majesty in favour of his favourite and friend Diego Velasquez and very evil words
            against Cortes and against all of us, and he made no report of the letters that we were
            bringing him, but merely said that Hernando Cortes had risen in rebellion against Diego
            Velasquez, and such-like things. Let me go back to say that Alonzo Hernandez Puerto-
            carrero and Francisco de Montejo and even Martin Cortes the father of Cortes and a
            certain Nunez, a licentiate and a 5Ã4 THE EMPEROk RECEIVES THE LETTEkS Reporter of His
            Majesty's Royal Council and a near rela- tion of Cortes, who worked on his behalf,
            decided to send a messenger to Flanders with other letters, the same as those they had
            given to the Bishop, for duplicates had been sent by our Proctors, and they wrote to His
            Majesty an account of all that was happening, and a memorandum of the golden jewels of
            the present, and made complaint of the Bishop and disclosed his business connection with
            Diego Velasquez. There were even other gentlemen who favoured them, those who did not
            stand well with Don Juan Rodri- guez de Fonseca, for it was rumoured that he was
            generally disliked on account of the great injustice and arrogance he displayed in the
            high offices that he held. As our great services were for God our Lord and for His
            Majesty, and we always put our full strength into them, it pleased God that His Majesty
            arrived at a clear knowledge of the affair and when he saw and understood it he and the
            Duke, Marquises, Counts and other gentlemen who were at his royal Court, showed such
            great satisfaction that they talked of nothing else but of Cortes and all of us who were
            helping him in the conquests for several days, and of the riches we were sending him
            from these lands. As for the letters of comment which the Bishop of Burgos had written
            to him about the matter, when His Majesty saw that it was all contrary to the truth,
            from then onwards he took a particular dislike to the Bishop, especially because he had
            not sent all the articles of gold but had kept back a great number of them. The Bishop
            got to know all this when it was written to him from Flanders, and he was very angry
            about it, and if the Bishop had spoken much that was evil of Cortes and all of us before
            our letters had come before His Majesty, from that time forward he openly called us

            was defied and even shamed and dishonoured and we were reputed as ver)* AND PROMISES HIS
            FAVOUR. 205 loyal subjects, as I shall relate further on when occasion arises. His
            Majesty wrote to say that he was soon coming to Castille and would take notice of the
            matters concerning us, and would grant us favours. As I shall later on narrate more
            fully, how and in what manner this happened, I will leave the matter here, with our
            Proctors awaiting the arrival of His Majesty. Before I go on any further I wish to speak
            with regard to what certain gentlemen who are curious in the matter have asked me, and
            they have a right to know about it, how it is that I am able to write down in this
            narrative things that I did not see, as at the time when our Proctors delivered the
            letters, messages, and presents of gold which they were carrying for His Majesty and had
            these disputes with the Bishop of Burgos, I was engaged in the conquest | of New Spain.
            I say this, that our Proctors wrote to us the true conquistador es, word for word in
            Chapters, all that was happening, both about the Bishop of Burgos, as well I as what His
            Majesty was pleased to promise in our favour, and how it all happened ; and Cortes sent
            us to the towns where we were living at the time, other letters that he had received
            from our Proctors that we might see how well they negotiated with His Majesty and how
            hostile the Bishop was to us. This I give as an answer to what I have been asked. Let us
            leave this subject and tell in another chapter what happened in our camp. 206 PLOT TO
            SEIZE A SHIP CHAPTER LVII. What was done in camp and the judgment which Cortes delivered
            after our ambassadors had departed to go to His Majesty with all the gold and letters
            and narratives. Within four days of the departure of our proctors to present themselves
            before our Lord the Emperor, as I have already narrated, (as it seems that men's hearts
            are of many kinds and are swayed by different thoughts,) some of the friends and
            dependents of Diego Velasquez, named Pedro Escudero, Juan Cermeno, and Gonzalo de Umbria
            a pilot, and Bernaldino de Coria, who was after- wards a settler in Chiapas, the father
            of a certain Centeno' and a priest named Juan Diaz, and certain sailors who called
            themselves Penates^, natives of Gibraltar*, who bore Cortes ill will, some of them
            because he had not given them leave to return to Cuba when he had promised to do so,
            others because they had not received their shares of the gold which had been sent to
            Spain, and the Penates on account of the flogging they had received in Cozumel for
            stealing salt pork from a soldier named Barrio, as I have already related. These men
            determined to seize a small ship and sail in her to Cuba to give notice to Diego Velas-
            quez and advise him how at Havana he might be able to seize our proctors on the estate
            of Francisco de Montejo, with all the gold and the messages, for it appears that they
            [the conspirators] had been advised by other persons in our camp that they [the
            proctors] would go to that estate and they [the other persons] had even written to Diego
            Velasquez that he would have an opportunity of capturing them. Thus, these men, whom I
            have named, had already got their stores in the ship, such as cassava bread, oil, fish,
            water, and made other preparations, and the time being past midnight, were ready to
            embark, when * Penates = rockmen. * Gibraleon in the text. AND SAIL TO CUBA IS
            FRUSTRATED. 20/ one of them (it was a certain Bernaldino de Coria) seems to have
            repented of his wish to return to Cuba, and went to report the matter to Cortes. When
            Cortes heard of it and learned how many there were and why they wished to get away, and
            who had given counsel and held the threads of the plot, he ordered the sails, compass
            and rudder to be removed at once from the ship, and had the men arrested, and their
            confessions taken down. They all told the truth, and their confessions involved in their
            guilt others who were remaining with us, but Cortes kept this quiet at the time as there
            was no other course open to him. The sentence which Cortes delivered was that Pedro
            Escudero and Juan Cermeno should be hanged ; that the pilot Gonzalo de Umbria, should
            have his feet cut off, and the sailors, Penates, should receive two hundred lashes each,
            and Father Juan Diaz, but for the honour of the church, would have been punished as well
            ; as it was he gave him a great fright. I remember that when Cortes signed that
            sentence, he said with great grief and sighs : " Would that I did not know how to write,
            so as not to have to sign away men's lives !" â and it seems to me that that saying is
            common among judges who have to sentence men to death, and is a quotation taken from
            that cruel Nero at the time when he showed signs of being a good Emperor. As soon as the
            sentence was carried out,^ Cortes rode off at break-neck speed for Cempoala which was
            five leagues distant, and ordered two hundred of us soldiers, and all the horsemen to
            follow him ; and I remember that Pedro de Alvarado, who three days before had been sent
            by Cortes with two hundred soldiers to the hill towns so as to get enough to eat, for in
            our town there was a great scarcity of supplies, was also ordered to go to Cempoala, *
            As the signature of Juan Cermeno is attached to the letter written by the army in 1520,
            it looks as though the sentence was not executed. 208 CORTES ORDERS THE SHIPS SO that
            orders could be there issued for our journey to Mexico. So Pedro de Alvarado was not
            present when, as I have described, justice was executed. The orders which were issued
            when we came together in Cempoala, I will relate fully further on. CHAPTER LVIIL How we
            settled to go to Mexico and to destroy all the ships before starting, and what else
            happened, and how the plan of destroying the ships was done by advice and decision of
            all of us who were friends with Cortes. Being in Cempoala, as I have stated, and
            discussing with Cortes questions of warfare, and our advance into the country, and going
            on from one thing to another, we, who were his friends, counselled him, although others
            opposed it, not to leave a single ship in the port, but to destroy them all at once, so
            as to leave no source of trouble behind, lest, when we were inland, others of our people
            should rebel like the last ; besides, we should gain much additional strength from the
            masters, pilots and sailors who numbered nearly one hundred men, and they would be
            better em- ployed helping us to watch and fight than remaining in port. As far as I can
            make out, this matter of destroying the ships which we suggested to Cortes during our
            conversa- tion, had already been decided on by him, but he wished it to appear as though
            it came from us, so that if any one should ask him to pay for the ships, he could say
            that he had acted on our advice and we would all be concerned in their payment. Then he
            sent Juan de Escalante (who was chief alguacil and a person of distinguished bravery and
            a great friend of Cortes, and an enemy of Diego Velasquez, because he had not given him
            good Indians in the Island of Cuba) to Villa Rica with orders to bring on shore all OF
            HIS FLEET TO BE DESTROYED. 209 the anchors, cables, sails, and everything else on board
            which might prove useful, and then to destroy the ships and preserve nothing but the
            boats, and that the pilots, sailing masters and sailors, who were old and no use for
            war, should stay at the town, and with the two nets they possessed should undertake the
            fishing, for there was always fish in that harbour, although they were not very
            plentiful. Juan de Escalante did all that he was told to do, and soon after arrived at
            Cempoala with a company of sailors, whom he had brought from the ships, and some of them
            turned out to be very good soldiers. When this was done, Cortes sent to summon all the
            Caciques of the hill towns who were allied to us and in rebellion against Montezuma, and
            told them how they muist give their service to the Spaniards who remained in Villa Rica,
            to finish building the church, fortress and houses, and Cortes took Juan de Escalante by
            the hand before them all, and said to them : " This is my brother," and told them to do
            whatever he should order them, and that should they need protection or assistance
            against the Mexicans, they should go to him and he would come in person to their
            assistance. All the Caciques willingly promised to do what might be asked of them, and I
            remember that they at once fumigated Juan de Escalante with incense, although he did not
            wish it done. I have already said that he was a man well qualified for any post and a
            great friend of Cortes, so he could place him in command of the town and harbour with
            confidence, so that if Diego Velasquez should send an expedition there, it would meet
            with resistance. I must leave him here and go on with my story. It is here that the
            historian Gomara says that when Cortes ordered the ships to be scuttled that he did not
            dare to let the soldiers know that he wished to go to Mexico in search of the great
            Montezuma. It was not as J' 210 CORTES ADDRESSES THE TROOPS. he States, for what sort of
            Spaniards should wc be not to wish to go ahead, but to linger in places where there was
            neither profit nor fighting? This same Gomara also says that Pedro de Ircio remained as
            captain in Vera Cruz ; he was misinformed. I repeat that it was Juan de Escalante who
            remained there as Captain and chief Alguacil of New Spain, and that so far, Pedro de
            Ircio had not been given any position whatever â not even charge of a company. CHAPTER
            LIX. About a discourse which Cortes made to us after the ships had been destroyed, and
            how we hastened our departure for Mexico. When the ships had been destroyed, with our
            full know- ledge, and not [secretly] as is said by the historian Gomara, one morning
            after we had heard mass, when all the captains and soldiers were assembled and were
            talking to Cortes about military matters, he begged us to listen to him, and argued with
            us as follows : â " We all understood what was the work that lay before us, and that
            with the help of our Lord Jesus Christ we must conquer in all battles and encounters
            [that fell to our lot], and must be as ready for them as was befitting, for if we were
            anywhere defeated, which pray God would not happen, we could not raise our heads again,
            as we were so few in numbers, and we could look for no help or assistance, but that
            which came from God, for we no longer possessed ships in which to return to Cuba, but
            must rely on our own good swords and stout hearts," â and he went on to draw many
            comparisons and relate the heroic deeds of the Romans. One and all we answered him that
            we would obey his orders, that the die was cast for good fortune, as Caesar said when he
            crossed the Rubicon, and that we A LETTER FROM JUAN DE ESCALANTE. 211 were all of us
            ready to serve God and the King. After this excellent speech, which was delivered with
            more honied words and greater eloquence than I can express here, he [Cortes] at once
            sent for the fat Cacique and reminded him that he should treat the church and cross with
            great reverence and keep them clean ; and he also told him that he meant to depart at
            once for Mexico to order Montezuma not to rob or offer human sacrifices, and that he now
            had need of two hundred Indian carriers to transport his artillery, for as I have
            already said these Indians can carry two arrobas^ on their backs and march five leagues
            with it. He also asked fifty of the leading warriors to go with us. Just as we were
            ready to set out, a soldier, whom Cortes had sent to Villa Rica with orders for some of
            the men remaining there to join him, returned from the town bearing a letter from Juan
            de Escalante, saying that there was a ship sailing along the coast, and that he had made
            smoke signals and others, and had raised some white cloths as banners, and had galloped
            along on horseback waving a scarlet cape so that those on ship- board might see it, and
            he believed that they had seen his signals, banners, horse and cape, but that they did
            not wish to come into the harbour, and that he had sent some Spaniards to watch to what
            place the ships should go, and they had reported that the ship had dropped anchor near
            the mouth of a river distant about three leagues, and that he wished to know what he
            should do. When Cortes had read the letter he at once ordered Pedro de Alvarado to take
            charge of all his army at Cempoala and with him Gonzalo de Sandoval who was already
            giving proofs of being a very valorous man, as he always remained. This was the first
            time that Sandoval was given a command, and because he was appointed * Two arrobas * 50
            lbs. ^ 2 212 SHIPS SENT BY FRANCISCO DE GARAY to this command, and Alonzo de Ãvila was
            passed over, there arose certain irritation between Alonzo de Avila and Sandoval. Then
            Cortes rode off at once in company with four horsemen, leaving orders for fifty of the
            most active soldiers to follow him, and he named those of us who were to form this
            company and that same night we arrived at Villa Rica. What happened there, I will tell
            further on. CHAPTER LX. How Cortes went to where the ship was anchored and how we
            captured six of the soldiers and mariners who belonged to the ship, and what happened
            about it. When, as I have related, we reached Villa Rica, Juan de Escalante came to
            speak to Cortes and said that it would be as well to go to the ship that night, lest she
            should set sail and depart, and that he would go and do this with twenty soldiers while
            Cortes rested himself Cortes replied that he could not rest, that " a lame goat must not
            nap/* that he would go in person with the soldiers he had brought with him. So before we
            could get a mouthful of food we started to march along the coast and on the road we came
            on four Spaniards who had come to take possession of the land in the name of Francisco
            de Garay the governor of Jamaica. These men had been sent by a captain named Alonzo
            Alvarez de Pineda or Pinedo, who a few days before had made a settlement on the Rio
            Panuco.* These four Spaniards whom we captured were named Guillen de la Loa, who had
            come as notary, and the witnesses he had brought with him to take possession 1 Pinedo
            had brought his ships right around the Gulf of Mexico from the coast of Florida, See
            Orozco y Berra^ vol. iv, p. 176. Arrive: oÃ­Ã­ thE mÃ©xicÃ­an coasÃ­. Ã¡t^ of the country were
            Andres Nunez, who was a boat builder, another named Master Pedro, he of the harp^ from
            Valencia, and another whose name I cannot now remember. When Cortes clearly understood
            that they had come to take possession of the country in the name of Francisco de Garay,
            and knew that he was staying behind in Jamaica and sending captains to do the work,
            Cortes asked them by what right and title those captains came. The four men re- plied
            that in the year 1 518 as the fame of the lands we had discovered by the expeditions of
            Francisco Hernandez de Cordova and Juan de Grijalva and of the twenty thousand golden
            dollars which we had taken to Cuba for Diege Velasquez had spread throughout the
            Islands, that then Garay had information from the pilot, Anton de Alaminos, and the
            other pilot who had accompanied us, that he could beg from His Majesty the right to all
            the country he could discover from the Rio San Pedro and San Pablo towards the north. As
            Garay had friends at Court who could support his petition, namely, the Bishop of Burgos,
            the lawyer Zapata, and the secretary Conchillos, he hoped to obtain their assistance,
            and he sent his Mayordomo, named Torralva, to negotiate the matter, and this man brought
            back a com- mission for him as Adelantado and Governor of all [the land] he could
            discover [north] of the Rio San Pedro and San Pablo. Under this commission he at once
            despatched three ships with about two hundred and seventy soldiers and supplies and
            horses under the captain whom I have already mentioned named Alonzo Alvarez Pineda or
            Pinedo, who was settling on the Rio Panuco, about seventy leagues away ; and these
            Spaniards said that they ^ Maestre Pedro, el de la Arpa :â another named die shipmaster
            (or mate) Pedro, he of the harp (probably a musician). 5f4 CAPTURE OF SIX SPANIARDS were
            merely doing what their captain told them to do, and were in no way to blame. When
            Cortes had learned their business he cajoled them with many flattering speeches and
            asked them whether we could capture the ship. Guillen de la Loa, who was the leader of
            the four men, answered that they would wave to the ship and do what they could, but
            although they shouted and waved their cloaks and made signals, they would not come near,
            for, as those men said, their captain knew that the soldiers of Cortes were in the
            neighbour- hood and had warned them to keep clear of us. When we saw that they would not
            send a boat, we understood that they must have seen us from the ship as we came along
            the coast, and that unless we could trick them they would not send the boat ashore
            again. Cortes asked the four men to take off their clothes so that four of our men could
            put them on, and when this was done we returned along the coast the way we had come, so
            that our return could be seen from the ship and those on board might think that we had
            really gone away. Four of our soldiers remained behind wearing the other men's clothes,
            and we remained hidden in the wood with Cortes until past midnight, and then when the
            moon set it was dark enough to return to the mouth of the creek, but we kept well hidden
            so that only the four soldiers could be seen. When the dawn broke the four soldiers
            began to wave their cloaks to the ship, and six sailors put off from her in a boat. Two
            of the sailors jumped ashore to fill two jugs with water and we who were with Cortes
            kept in hiding waiting for the other sailors to land ; but they stayed where they were
            and our four soldiers who were wearing the clothes of Garay's people pretended that they
            were washing their hands and kept their faces hidden. The men in the boat cried out : "
            Come on board, what are you doing ? Why don't you come ? " One of our men answered :
            tROkÃ­ PÃNEDO^S wSHlf. 51$ " Come on shore for a minute and you will see." As they did
            not know his voice, they pushed off with their boat, and although we shouted to them
            they would answer nothing. We wanted to shoot at them with muskets and cross bows, but
            Cortes would not allow it, and said : " Let them go in peace and report to their
            captain." So six soldiers from that ship remained in our company, the four we had first
            captured, and the two sailors who had come ashore. And we returned to Villa Rica without
            having had anything to eat since we first started. This is really what happened and not
            what the historian Gomara relates, for he says that Garay came at this time ; but it was
            not so, for before he himself came he first sent three captains with ships, and later on
            I will explain at what time they came and what happened to them, and I will tell, as
            well, about the coming of Garay. But we must get on now and I will relate how we settled
            to go to Mexico. The March from Cempoala to Tlaxcala. Introductory Note to Chapter LXL
            The Spaniards left Cempoala on the i6th August and crossed the frontier into Tlaxcalan
            territory on the 31st August. Bernal Diaz says that they reached Jalapa on the first
            day, but that is not probable. Between Jalapa and Ixtacmaxtitlan there is no name given
            by Bernal Diaz or Cortes which coincides with a name on the modem map, although the
            Socochima of the narrative is undoubtedly Xico Viejo, a few miles from the modem village
            of Xico. The ruins of Xico Viejo were recently visited by Dr. J. W. Fewkes, who says
            that *' the last half mile of the road is practically impassable for horses, and must be
            made on foot, justifying the statements of Gomara regarding the difficulties the
            horsemen of Cortes encountered in reaching the pueblo." (Twenty-fifth Annual Report,
            Bureau of Ameri- can Ethnology, 1903-4-) The Theuhixuacan mentioned by Gomara must be
            the Ixuacan of the modem map. The Spaniards passed to the south of the great mountain
            mass of the Cofre de Perote (13,403 ft.) between that mountain and the ^16 THE MARCH
            FROM CEMPOALA TO TLAXCALÃ. snowcapped volcano of Orizaba (17,365 ft.) to the tableland
            of Tlaxcala. There is a considerable rise between Cempoala and Jalapa, which stands at
            an elevation of 4608 ft. I am unable to ascertain the height of the pass between Perote
            and Orizaba, but it probably exceeds 10,000 ft., followed by a descent of I about 3000
            ft. to the plains of Tlaxcala and Puebla, which are 7000 ft. f to 8000 ft. above sea
            level. According to Bemal Diaz, the most difficult pass (Puerto de Nombre de Dios) was
            crossed before reaching the main divide. After the passage between the mountains the
            Spaniards came to the salt lakes, marshes, and inhospitable stretches of sand and
            volcanic ash which extend along the western slope of the Cofte de Peroie. It is
            impossible to locate the exact route between the mountain pass and Zocotlan, as no names
            are given and part of the country is uninha- bitable. Zocotlan itself was in all
            probability the Zautla of the modem map, but we are not on secure ground until the
            Spaniards reach Ixtacmaxtitlan, near the Tlaxcalan frontier. This frontier is still
            marked by the ruins of the wall built by the Tlaxcalans as a defence against their
            enemies, but the ruins are not marked on the Govern- ment map. However, the natural line
            of travel would be up stream from Ixtacmaxtitlan, and this would bring us to a place
            marked on the map Altlatlaya (no doubt AialayOy which means a wtUck tower)^ and I have
            taken this to be the spot where the Spaniards passed the wall, and have so marked it on
            the map which accompanies this volume. The march from Jalapa to Zocotlan must have been
            a most arduous one, and all the more difficult horn the fact that it was undertaken in
            the middle of the rainy season. There is a much easier, although somewhat longer, route
            passing round the north of Cofrc de Perote, but this was probably avoided by the
            Cempoalans as passing through too much of the enemies' country. Appended is an

            the Cacique we went by way of Tlaxcala, and what happened to us in our warlike
            engagements and other matters. When our departure for Mexico had received full con-
            sideration, we sought advice as to the road we should take, and the chieftains of
            Cempoala were agreed that the best and most convenient road for us to take was through
            the province of Tlaxcala, for they [the Tlaxcalans] were their allies and mortal enemies
            of the Mexicans. Fqrty chieftains, all warriors, were already prepared to accompany us
            and were of great assistance to us on that journey ; and they provided us as well with
            two I 2lÃ© THE MARCH FROM CEMtOAÃA I hundred carriers to transport our artillery. We poor
            I soldiers had no need of help, for at that time we had nothing to carry except our
            arms, lances, muskets, cross- bows, shields and the like, with which we both marched and
            slept, and we were shod with hempen shoes, and as I have often said, were always
            prepared for a fight In the middle of August, 1519, we set out from Ccm- poala, keeping
            always in good formation, with scouts and some of the most active soldiers in advance.
            The first day we marched to a town named Jalapa, and thence to Socochima, a strong place
            with a difficult approach, and inside there were many vines of the grapes of the
            country^ on trellises. In both these towns, through our interpreters. Dona Marina and
            JerÃ³nimo de Aguilar, all matters touching our holy religion were explained to , the
            people, and that we were the vassals of the Emperor Don Carlos, who had sent us to put
            an end to human sacrifices and robbery, and they were told other things which it was
            advantageous to state. As they were friends of the Cempoalans and did not pay tribute to
            Montezuma, we found them very well disposed towards us, and they provided us with food.
            A cross was erected in each town and its meaning was explained to them and they were
            told to hold it in great reverence. 1 Beyond Socochima we crossed some high mountain
            ranges by a pass, and arrived at another town named Texutla, where we were also well
            received, for like the others they paid no tribute to Mexico. On leaving that j town we
            finished the ascent of the mountains and entered an uninhabited country, and it was very
            cold and hail and rain fell that night. There was a great scarcity of food and a wind
            came down from the snowy hills on one side of us which made us shiver with cold. As we
            had come from * These were probably grenadillas, the fruit of passion flowers. fÃ°
            ÃÃOCOtLAN. Ã¡l$ the Island of Cuba and from Villa Rica, where the whole coast is very
            hot, and had entered a cold country and had nothing with which to cover ourselves, only
            our armour, we suffered from the frost, for we were not accustomed to a different
            temperature. Then we entered another pass where there were some hamlets and large
            temples with idols, which I have already said are called Cues^ and they had great piles
            of firewood for the service of the idols which were kept in those temples ; but still
            there was nothing to eat, and the cold was intense. We next entered into the land
            belonging to the town of Xocotlan, and we sent two Cempoala Indians to advise the
            Cacique how we were faring so that the people might receive us favourably. This town was
            subject to Mexico, so we always marched on the alert and in good order for we could see
            that we were already in a different sort of country, and when we saw the white gleam of
            the roof tops and the houses of the Caciques and the cues and numerous oratories, which
            were very lofty and covered with white plaster, they looked very pleasing like a town in
            our own Spain, so we called the place Castilblanco, for some Portuguese soldiers said
            that it reminded them of Castil- blanco in Portugal, and so it is called to this day.
            And when, through our messengers, they knew in this town that we were approaching, the
            Cacique and other chieftains came out to meet us close by their houses. The name of the
            Cacique was Olintecle, and he conducted us to some lodgings and gave us food, but there
            was very little of it and it was given with ill will. As soon as we had eaten, Cortes
            asked through our interpreters about their Lord Montezuma. The chief told us of his
            great strength in warriors, which he kept in all the provinces under his sway, without
            counting many other armies which were posted on the frontiers and in neighbouring
            provinces, and he [the chief] then spoke of the ^2Ã OLINTECLE DESCRIBES KfEXlCÃ. great
            fortress of Mexico, and how the houses were built in the water, and how one can only
            pass from one house to another by means of bridges which they have made, or canoes ; and
            how all the houses have flat roofs, which, by raising breastworks when they are needed,
            can be turned into fortresses. That the city is entered by three causeways, each
            causeway having four or five openings in it through which the water can flow from one
            part to another, and each opening has a wooden bridge over it so that when any one of
            those bridges is raised no one can enter the city of Mexico. Then the chief told us of
            the great store of gold and silver, and chalchihuite stones and other riches which
            Montezuma, his lord, possessed, and he never ceased telling us how great a lord he was,
            so that Cortes and all of us marvelled at hearing him. The more he told us about the
            great fortress and bridges, of such stufi* are we Spanish soldiers made, the more we
            wanted to try our luck against them, although it seemed a hopeless enterprise, judging
            from what Olintecle explained and told us. In reality Mexico was much stronger and had
            better munitions and defences than anything he told us about, for it is one thing to
            have seen the place itself and its strength, and quite another thing to describe it as I
            do. He added that Montezuma was so great a prince that he placed anything he chose under
            his rule, and that he did not know if he would be pleased when he heard of our stay in
            that town, and that we had been given lodgings and food without his permission. Cortes
            replied through our interpreters : â " I would have you know that we have come from
            distant lands at the order of our lord and King, the Emperor Don Carlos, who has many
            and great princes as his vassals, and he sends us to command your great Prince Montezuma
            not to sacrifice or kill any more Indians, or to rob his vassals, or to seize any more
            lands, but to give his fealty to our lord the King. THE SPANIARDS MUST BE TEULES ! 221
            And now I say the same to you, Olintecle, and to all the other Caciques who are with
            you, desist from your sacri- fices, and no longer eat the flesh of your own relations,
            and cease to commit sodomy, and the other evil customs which you practice, for such is
            the will of our Lord God, whom we believe in and worship, the giver of life and death
            who will take us up to heaven." He told them many other things concerning our holy
            religion, to all of which things they made no reply. Cortes said to the soldiers who
            were present around him : " It seems to me, gentlemen, that there remains nothing for us
            to do but to set up a cross." But Padre Fray Bar- tolomÃ© de Olmedo replied : â " It
            seems to me, sir, that the time has not yet come to leave crosses in the charge of these
            people for they are somewhat shameless and without fear, and as they are vassals of
            Montezuma they may burn the crosses or do some other evil thing, and what you have said
            to them is enough until they know something more of our holy religion." So the matter
            was settled and no cross was set up.* Let us leave this subject and that of the holy
            warnings which we gave them, and I will go on to say that we had with us a very large
            lurcher which belonged to Francisco de Lugo, which barked much of a night, and it seems
            that the Caciques of the town asked our friends whom we had brought from Cempoala,
            whether it was a tiger or a lion, or an animal with which to kill Indians, and they
            answered them : " They take it with them to kill anyone who annoys them." They also
            asked what we did with the artillery we had brought with us, and the Cempoalans replied
            that with some stones which we put inside them we could kill anyone we wished to kill,
            and that the horses ran like deer and they would catch anyone we told them to run after.
            Then Olintecle said to the other chiefs : " Surely they must be Teules ! " I have
            already said that Teule is the name they 222 100,000 HUMAN SKULLS. give to their gods or
            idols and such like evil things. Our Indian friends replied : " So at last you have
            found it out ! Take care not to do anything to annoy them, for they will know it at once
            ; they even know one's thoughts. These Teules are those who captured the tax gatherers
            of }our great Montezuma and decreed that no more tribute should be paid throughout the
            sierras nor in our town of Cempoala ; and they are the same who turned our Teules out of
            their temples and replaced them with their own gods and who have conquered the people of
            Tabasco and Chanpoton, and they are so good that they have made friendship between us
            and the people of Cingapacinga. In addition to this you have seen how the great
            Montezuma, notwithstanding all his power, has sent them gold and cloth, and now they
            have come to your town and we see that you have given them nothing ; â run at once and
            bring them a present ! " It seems that we had brought good advocates with us, for the
            townspeople soon brought us four pendants, and three necklaces, and some lizards, all
            made of gold, but all the gold was of poor quah'ty ; and they brought us four Indian
            women who were good for grinding maize for bread, and one load of cloth. Cortes received
            these things with a cheerful good will and with many expressions of thanks. I remember
            that in the plaza where some of their oratories stood, there were piles of human skulls
            so regularly arranged that one could count them, and I estimated them at more than a
            hundred thousand. I repeat again that there were more than one hundred thousand of them.
            And in another part of the plaza there were so many piles of dead men's thigh bones that
            one could not count them ; there was also a large number of skulls strung between beams
            of wood, and three priests who had charge of these bones and skulls were guarding them.
            We had occasion to see many such things later on as we penetrated into the I DEPARTURE
            FOR TLAXCALA. 223 country for the same custom was observed in all the towns, including
            those of Tlaxcala. After all that I have related had happened, we determined to set out
            on the road to Tlaxcala which our friends told us was very near, and that the boundary
            was close by where some boundary stones were placed to mark it. So we asked the Cacique
            Olintecle, which was the best and most level road to Mexico, and he replied the road
            which passed by the large town named Cholula, and the Cempoalans said to Cortes : â "
            Sir, do not go by Cholula for the people there are treacherous, and Montezuma always
            keeps a large garrison of warriors in that town ; " â and they advised us to go by way
            of Tlaxcala where the people were their friends and enemies of the Mexicans. So we
            agreed to take the advice of the Cempoalans, trusting that God would direct us. Cortes
            demanded of Olintecle twenty warrior chiefs to go with us, and he gave them at once. The
            next morning we set out for Tlaxcala and arrived at a little town belonging to the
            people of Xalacingo. From this place we sent two of the Cempoala chieftains as
            messengers, choosing two who had said much in praise of the Tlax- calans and had
            declared that they were their friends, and by them we sent a letter to the Tlaxcalans,
            although we knew that they could not read it ; and also a red fluffy Flemish hat, such
            as was then worn. What happened I will relate further on. 224 BOOK IV.â THE WAR IN
            TLAXCALA. Introductory Note, Between the 31st August when the Spaniards crossed the
            Tlaxcalan frontier and fought a skirmish with some Otomi-Tlaxcalan troops, and the 23rd
            September when they entered the Capital of Tlaxcala, only two dates are mentioned by
            Bernal Diaz. He gives the 2nd September (Gomara says the ist September) as the date of
            the first great battle against the Tlaxcalan army under Xicotenca (Xicotencatl), and the
            name of the battlefield as Tehuacingo or Tehuacacingo, which cannot now be identified.
            After the battle the Spaniards took shelter in a village with a temple on a hill ; this
            hill is still pointed out by the natives as the site of Cortes' camp. Here the Spaniards
            formed a fortified camp, which continued to be their headquarters until the war was
            over, and they marched to the Capital of Tlaxcala. Bernal Diaz tells us that this camp
            was near Cunpanzingo, probably the Tzompantzingo of the modern maps. Bernal Diaz gives
            the 5lh September as the date of the second great battle, which was fought close by the
            camp. Although the accounts of the war in Tlaxcala given by Bernal Diaz and Cortes agree
            in the main points, they do not always give the events in the same order. It seems
            probable that Bernal Diaz places the night attack too early, and that it took place
            after Xicotenga had sent the spies to the Spanish camp. The boundaries of the so-called
            Republic of Tlaxcala appear to have been almost identical with those of the modem state
            of the same name. It has become a commonplace to describe the Tlaxcalans as hardy
            mountaineers and their form of Government as Republican, but such discrimination is
            misleading. Their country was no more mountainous than that of the Mexicans, and their
            form of Government was much the same as that of other NahuÃ¡ communities ; but as they
            had achieved no foreign conquests, they were compelled to be self-support- ing, and in
            that differed from the Mexicans, who were becoming a military caste, supported to a
            great extent by tribute from conquered tribes. Their country was fertile, and there must
            have been a large agricultural population, and all the men were inured to hardship and
            continual border warfare. According to Andres de TÃ¡pia, the existence of the Tlaxcalans
            as an independent nation was owing to the forbearance of the Mexicans themselves, for
            when he asked why they had not been conquered, Montezuma himself answered : ** We could
            easily do so, but then there would be nowhere for the young men to exercise themselves
            without going a long way off, and besides we always like to have people tg sacrifice to
            our Gods," BOOK IV. THE WAR IN TLAXCALA. CHAPTER LXII. How we decided to go by way of
            Tlaxcala, and how we sent messen- gers to induce the Tlaxcalans to agree to our passage
            through their country, how the messengers were taken prisoners, and what else happened.
            O we set out from Castilblanco and began our march with the scouts in advance,
            constantly on the alert, and the musketeers and crossbowmen in good order, as was
            necessary, and the horsemen in even closer order, and we all carrying our arms, as was
            always our custom. I will say nothing more about this, for it is no use wasting words
            over it, for we were always so much on the alert both by day and night that if an alarm
            had been given ten times over we should have been found ready every time. In such order
            we arrived at a little town of Xalacingo, where they gave us a golden necklace and some
            cloth and two Indian women, and from that town we sent two Cempoalan chieftains as
            messengers to Tlaxcala, with a letter, and a fluffy red Flemish hat, such as was then
            worn. We well knew that the Tlaxcalans could not read Q I 226 MESSENGERS SEIZED BY THE
            TLAXCALANS the letter, but we thought that when they saw paper different from their own,
            they would understand that it contained a message ; and what we sent to tell them was
            that we were coming to their town, and hoped they would receive us well, as we came, not
            to do them harm, but to make them our friends. We did this because in this little town
            they assured us that the whole of TIaxcala was up in arms against us, for it appears
            that they had already received news of our approach and that we were accom- panied by
            many friends, both from Cempoala and Zocotlan, and other towns through which we had
            passed. As all these towns usually paid tribute to Montezuma, the Tlax- calans took it
            for granted that we were coming to attack TIaxcala, as their country had often been
            entered by craft and cunning and then laid waste, and they thought that this was another
            attempt to do so. So as soon as our two messengers arrived with the letter and the hat
            and began to deliver their message, they were seized as prisoners before their story was
            finished, and we waited all that day and the next for an answer and none arrived. Then
            Cortes addressed the chiefs of the town [where we had halted] and repeated all he was
            accustomed to tell the Indians about our holy religion and how we were vassals of our
            Lord and King who had sent us to these parts to put an end to human sacrifices, and the
            eating of human flesh, and the other evils which they were used to practise, and he told
            them many other things which we usually repeated in most of the towns we passed through,
            and after making them many promises of assistance, he asked for twenty Indian warriors
            of quality to accompany us on our march, and they were given us most willingly. After
            commending ourselves to God, with a happy confidence we set out on the following day for
            TIaxcala, and as we were marching along, we met our two messengers who had been taken
            prisoners. It seems that the Indians ESCAPE FROM THEIR CAPTORS. 227 who guarded them
            were perplexed by the warlike prepara- tions and had been careless of their charge, and
            in fact, had let them out of prison. They arrived in such a state of terror at what they
            had seen and heard that they could hardly succeed in expressing themselves. According to
            their account, when they were prisoners the Tlaxcalans had threatened them, saying : "
            Now we are going to kill those whom you call Teules, and eat their flesh, and we will
            see whether they are as valiant as you announce ; and we shall eat your flesh too, you
            who come here with treasons and lies from that traitor Montezuma ! " and for all that
            the messengers could say, that we were against the Mexicans, and wished to be brothers
            to the Tlaxcalans, they could not persuade them of its truth. When Cortes and all of us
            heard those haughty words, and learned how they were prepared for war, although it gave
            us matter for serious thought, we all cried : â " If this is so, forward â and good luck
            to us!" We commended ourselves to God and marched on, the Alferez, Corral, unfurling our
            banner and carrying it before us, for the people of the little town where we had slept,
            as well as the Cempoalans assured us that the Tlaxcalans would come out to meet us and
            resist our entry into their country. Marching along as I have described, we discussed
            how the horsemen â in parties of three so as to help one another â should charge and
            return at a hand gallop with their lances held rather short, and when they broke through
            the hostile ranks should hold their lances before their faces and not stop to give
            thrusts, so that the Indians should not be able to seize hold of their lances ; and if
            by chance a lance were seized, the horseman should use all his strength and put spurs to
            his horse, so that helped by the leverage of the lance held beneath his arm, the furious
            rush of the horse might enable him to wrench it from the grasp of the Indian, or should
            drag him along with Q2 228 THE TLAXCALAN FRONTIER IS CROSSED. it. It will be said to-day
            â ^what was the use of all this preparation when there were no hostile warriors in sight
            to attack us ? I answer this by repeating the words of Cortes : â " Gentlemen and
            comrades, seeing bow few of us there are, it behoves us to be always as well prepared
            and as much on the alert as though we saw the enemy approaching to attack us, and not
            only saw them approach- ing, but we should behave as though we were already fighting
            them ; and, as it often happens that they seize the lances with their hands, we have to
            be prepared for such an emergency as well as for anything else that may happen to a
            soldier. I have fully understood that, when fighting, there should be no need of
            directions, for I know, and am very willing to acknowledge it, that you behave much more
            courageously [without them]." In this way we marched about two leagues, when we came
            upon a fortress strongly built of stone and lime and some other cement, so strong that
            with iron pickaxes it was difficult to demolish it and it was constructed in such a way
            both for offence and defence, that it would be very difficult to capture. We halted to
            examine it, and Cortes asked the Indians from Zocotlan for what purpose the fortress had
            been built in such a way. They replied that, as war was always going on between the
            people of Tlaxcala and their lord, Montezuma, the Tlaxcalans had built this fort so
            strong the better to defend their towns, for we were already in their territory. We
            rested awhile and this, our entry into the land of Tlaxcala and the fortress, gave us
            plenty to think about. Cortes said : " Sirs, let us follow our banner which bears the
            sign of the holy cross, and through it we shall conquer!*' Then one and all we answered
            him : " May good fortune attend our advance, for in God lies the true strength." So we
            began our march again in the order I have already noted. We had not gone far when our
            scouts observed about SKIRMISH WITH TLAXCALAN TROOPS. Ã¡Ã¡^ thirty Indians who were
            spying. These carried two-handed swords, shields, lances and plumes of feathers. The
            swords are made with stones which cut worse than knives, so cleverly arranged, that one
            can neither break nor pull out the blades ; they are as long as broadswords ; and as I
            have already said, these spies wore devices and feather head- dresses, and when our
            scouts observed them they came back to give us notice. Cortes then ordered the same
            scouts to follow the spies, and to try and capture one of them without hurting them ;
            and then he sent five more mounted men as a support, in case there should be an ambush.
            Then all our army hastened on in good order and with quick step, for our Indian friends
            who were with us said that there was sure to be a large body of warriors waiting in
            ambush. When the thirty Indian spies saw the horsemen coming towards them, and beckoning
            to them with their hands, they would not wait for them to come up and capture one of
            them ; furthermore, they defended them- selves so well, that with their swords and
            lances they wounded some of the horses. When our men saw how fiercely the Indians fought
            and that their horses were wounded, they were obliged to kill five of the Indians. As
            soon as this happened, a squadron of Tlaxcalans,^ more than three thousand strong, which
            was lying in ambush, fell on them all of a sudden, with great fury and began to shower
            arrows on our horse- men who were now all together ; and they made a good fight with
            their arrows and fire-hardened darts, and did wonders with their two-handed swords. At
            this moment we came up with our artillery, muskets and crossbows, and Â» Probably Otomis
            from the Otomi town of Tecoac. Cortes says the chiefs of Tlaxcala sent messengers to say
            that the attack was made by communities (of Otomis?) without their knowledge. 230 THE
            ENEMY RETREATS. little by little the Indians gave way, but they had kept their ranks and
            fought well for a considerable time. In this encounter they wounded four of our men and
            I think that one of them died of his wounds a few days later. As it was now late the
            Tlaxcalans beat a retreat and we did not pursue them ; they left about seventeen dead on
            the field, not counting many wounded. Where these skirmishes took place the ground was
            level and there were many houses and plantations of maize and magueys, which is the
            plant from which they make their wine. We slept near a stream, and with the grease from
            a fat Indian whom we had killed and cut open, we dressed our wounds, for we had no oil,
            and we supped very well on some dogs which the Indians breed [for food] for all the
            houses were abandoned and the provisions carried off, and they had even taken the dogs
            with them, but these came back to their homes in the night, and there we captured them,
            and they proved good enough food. All night we were on the alert with watches and
            patrols and scouts, and the horses bitted and saddled, in fear lest the Indians would
            attack us. I will leave off here and go on .to tell of the war they waged against us.
            CHAPTER LXIII. Of the war which was waged and the perilous battles which we fought
            against the Tlaxcalans, and what else happened. The next day, after commending ourselves
            to God, we set out with all our ranks in good order, the horsemen well instructed in the
            way they should charge through the enemy and return to us, and to see that the enemy
            should not be permitted to break our ranks and separate us one A GREAT BATTLE IS FOUGHT.
            23! from the other. As we thus marched on, two armies of warriors approached to give us
            battle. They numbered six thousand men [and they came on us] with loud shouts and the
            din of drums and trumpets, as they shot their arrows and hurled their darts and acted
            like brave warriors. Cortes ordered us to halt, and sent forward the three prisoners
            whom we had captured the day before, to tell them not to make war on us as we wished to
            treat them as brothers. He also told one of our soldiers, named Diego de Godoy, who was
            a royal notary, to watch what took place so that he could bear witness if it should be
            necessary, so that at some future time we should not have to answer for the deaths and
            damages which were likely to take place, for we begged them to keep the peace. When the
            three prisoners whom we had sent forward began to speak to the Indians, it only
            increased their fur>^ and they made such an attack on us that we could not endure it.
            Then Cortes shouted : â " Santiagoâ and at them 1 " and we attacked them with such
            impetuosity that we killed and wounded many of them with our fire and among them three
            captains. They then began to retire towards some ravines, where over forty thousand
            warriors and their captain general, named Xicotenga, were lying in ambush, all wearing a
            red and white device for that was the badge and livery of Xicotenga As there was broken
            ground there we could make no use of the horses, but by careful manÅuvring we got past
            it, but the passage was very perilous for they made play with their good archery and
            with their lances and broadswords did us much hurt, and the hail of stones from their
            slings was even more damaging. When we reached the level ground with our horsemen and
            artillery, we paid them back and slew many of them, but we did not dare to break our
            formation, for any soldier who left the ranks to follow some of the Indian captains and
            swordsmen was at once 232 TLAXCALAN ARMY COMMANDED wounded and ran great danger. As the
            battle went on they surrounded us on all sides and we could do little or nothing. We
            dared not charge them, unless we charged all together, lest they should break up our
            formation ; and if we did charge them, as I have said, there were twenty squadrons ready
            to resist us, and our lives were in great danger for they were so numerous they could
            have blinded us with handfuls of earth, if God in his great mercy had not succoured us.
            While we found ourselves in this conflict among these great warriors and their fearful
            broad swords, we noticed that many of the strongest among them crowded together to lay
            hands on a horse. They set to work with a furious attack, laying hands on a good mare
            known to be very handy either for sport or for charging. The rider, Pedro de Moron, was
            a very good horseman, and as he charged with three other horsemen into the ranks of the
            enemy (they were ordered thus to charge together, so as to help one another) the Indians
            seized hold of his lance and he was not able to drs^ it away, and others gave him cuts
            with their broadswords and wounded him badly, and then they slashed at the mare, and cut
            her head off at the neck so that it hung by the skin, and she fell dead. If his mounted
            companions had not come at once to his rescue they would also have finished killing
            Pedro de Moron. We might possibly have helped him with our whole battalion, but I repeat
            again that we hardly dared to move from one place to another for fear that they would
            finally rout us, and we could not move one way or another ; i^ was all we could do to
            hold our own and prevent ourselves from being defeated. However, we rushed to the
            conflict around the mare and managed to save Moron from the hands of the enemy who were
            already dragging him off half dead and we cut the mare's girths so as not to leave the
            saddle behind. In that act of rescue, ten of our men BY XICOTENGA IS DEFEATED. 233 were
            wounded and I remember that at the same time we killed four of the (Indian) captains,
            for we were advancing in close order and we did great execution with our swords. When
            this had happened, the enemy began to retire, carrying the mare with them, and they cut
            her in ^ pieces to exhibit in all the towns of Tlaxcala, and we learnt afterwards that
            they made an offering to their idols of the horseshoes, of the Flemish felt hat, and the
            two letters which we had sent them offering peace. The mare that was killed belonged to
            Juan Sedefto and it was because Sedeno had received three wounds the day before that he
            had given her to Moron who was a good horseman. I did not see Moron again for he died of
            his wounds two days later. To return to our battle : we were a full hour fighting in the
            fray, and our shots must have done the enemy much damage for they were so numerous and
            in such close formation, that each shot must have hit many of them. Horsemen,
            musketeers, crossbowmen, swordsmen, and those who used lance and shield, one and all, we
            fought like men to save our lives and to do our duty, for we were certainly in the
            greatest danger in which we had ever found our- selves. Later on they told us that we
            killed many Indians in this battle, and among them eight of their leading captains, sons
            of the old Caciques who lived in their principal town, and for this reason they drew off
            in good order. We did not attempt to follow them, and we were not sorry for it as we
            were so tired out we could hardly stand, and we stayed where we were in that little
            town. All the country round was thickly peopled, and they even have some houses
            underground like caves in which many of the Indians live. The place where this battle
            took place is called Tehua- cingo or Tehuacacingo and it was fought on the 2nd day of
            the month of September in the year 1519. When we 234 THE SPANIARDS ENCAMP AND saw that
            victory was ours we gave thanks to God who had delivered us from such g^eat danger. From
            the field of battle we withdrew the whole force to some Cues which were strong and lofty
            like a fortress. We dressed the wounded men, who numbered fifteen, with the fat of the
            Indian I mentioned before. One man died of his wounds. We also doctored four or five
            horses which had received wounds, and we rested and supped very well that night, for we
            found a good supply of poultry and little dogs in the houses. And taking every
            precaution by posting spies, patrols and scouts, we rested until the next morning. In
            that battle we captured fifteen Indians, two of them chieftains. There was one
            peculiarity that the Tlaxcalans showed in this and all the other battles â that was to
            carry off any Indian as soon as he was wounded so that we should not be able to see
            their dead. CHAPTER LXIV. How we pitched our camp in some towns and hamlets called
            Teoa^ingo or Teva9Ãngo and what we did there. As we felt weary after the battles we had
            fought, and many of the soldiers and horses were wounded and some died there, and it was
            necessary to repair the crossbows and replenish our stock of darts, we passed one day
            without doing anything worthy of mention. The following morning Cortes said that it
            would be as wqll for all the horsemen who were fit for work to scour the country, so
            that the Tlaxcalans should not think that we had given up fighting on account of the
            last battle, and that they should see that we meant to follow them up ; for on the
            previous day we had halted without sallying forth to look for them, and it was better
            for us to go out and attack them than for them THEIR HORSEMEN SCOUR THE COUNTRY. 235 to
            come and attack us and thus find out our weakness. As the country was level and thickly
            populated, we set out with seven horsemen and a few musketeers and crossbow- men and
            about two hundred soldiers and our Indian allies, leaving the camp as well guarded as
            was possible. In the houses and towns through ^ich we passed, we captured about twenty
            Indian men and women without doing them any hurt, but our allies, who are a cruel
            people, burnt many of the houses and carried off much poultry and many dogs for food.
            When we returned to the camp which was not far off, Cortes set the prisoners free, after
            giving them something to eat, and Dofla Marina and Aguilar spoke kindly to them and gave
            them beads and told them not to be so mad any longer, but to make peace with us, as we
            wished to help them and treat them as brothers. Then we also released the two prisoners
            who were chieftains and they were given another letter, and were to tell the high
            Caciques who lived in the town â which was the capital of all the towns of the province
            â that we had not come to do them any harm or to annoy them, but to pass through , their
            country on our way to Mexico to speak to Montezuma. The two messengers went to
            Xicotenga's camp which was distant about two leagues among some towns and houses which I
            think they called Cuad9Ãnpacingo, and when they gave him the letter and our message the
            reply that their captain Xicotenga gave them was, that we might go to his town where his
            father was living ; that there peace would be made by satiating themselves on our flesh,
            and honour paid to his gods with our hearts and blood, and that we should see his answer
            the very next day. When Cortes and all of us heard that haughty message, as we were
            already tired out with the battles and encounters we had passed through, we certainly
            did not think that things looked well. So Cortes flattered the messengers with soft
            words for it seemed that they had lost all fear, 236 COMMUNICATION WITH XICOTENGA. and
            ordered them to be given some strings of beads, as he wished to send them back as
            messengers of peace. Cortes then learned from them more fully all about the Captain
            Xicotenga, and what forces he had with him. They told him that Xicotcnga had many more
            men with him now than he had when he attacked us before for he had five captains with
            him and each captain had brought ten thousand warriors. This was the way in which the
            count was made : Of the followers of Xicotenga who was blind from age â the father of
            the captain of the same name â ten thousand ; of the followers of another great chief
            named Mase Escasi,^ another ten thousand ; of the followers of another great chief named
            Chichimeca- tecle,* the same number ; of another great Cacique, lord of Topeyanco, named
            Tecapacaneca, another ten thousand ; and of another great chief named Guaxoban, another
            ten thousand ; so that there were in all fifty thousand. That their banner and standard
            had been brought out, which was a white bird with the appearance of an ostrich, with
            wings outstretched, as though it wished to fly, and that each company had its device and
            uniform, for each Cacique had a different one, as do our dukes and counts in our own
            Castile. All that I have here said we accepted as perfectly true, for certain Indians
            among those whom we had captured and who were released that day, related it very
            clearly, although they were not then believed. When we knew this, as we were but human
            and feared death, many of us, indeed the majority of us, confessed to the Padre de la
            Merced and to the priest, Juan Diaz, who were occupied all night in hearing our
            repentance and commending us to God and praying that He would pardon us and save us ^
            Maxixcatzin. ^ Chichimecatecuhtli. THE SECOND GREAT BATTLE. 237 from defeat. In this way
            the time passed until the next day, and the attack which they made on us I will now
            describe. CHAPTER LXV. Concerning the great battle which we fought against the forces of
            Tlaxcala, in which it pleased our Lord God to give us the victory, and what else
            happened. The next morning, the Sth of September, 15 19, we mus- tered the horses. There
            was not one of the wounded men who did not come forward to join the ranks and give as
            much help as he could. The crossbow men were warned to use the store of darts very
            cautiously, some of them loading while the others were shooting, and the musketeers were
            to act in the same way, and the men with sword and shield were instructed to aim their
            cuts and thrusts at the bowels [of their enemies] so that they would not dare to come as
            close to us as they did before. The artillery was all ready for action, and the horsemen
            had already been instructed to aid one another and to hold their lances short, and not
            to stop to spear anyone except in the face and eyesâ charging and returning at a hand
            gallop and no soldier was on any account to break away from the ranks. With our banner
            unfurled, and four of our comrades guarding the standard-bearer. Corral, we set out from
            our camp. We had not marched half a quarter of a league before we began to see the
            fields crowded with warriors with great feather crests and distinguishing devices, and
            to hear the blare of horns and trumpets. Here would be a great opportunity to write down
            in proper order what happened to us in this most perilous and doubtful battle, for so
            many warriors surrounded us on all sides that [the situation] might be compared to a 238
            TLAXC ALANS UNDER XICOTENGA great plain, two leagues long and about the same breadth,
            and in its midst, four hundred men. Thus all the plain was swarming with warriors and we
            stood four hundred men in number, and of those many sick and wounded. And we knew for
            certain that this time our foe came with the determination to leave none of us alive
            excepting those who would be sacrificed to their idols. To go back to our battle : How
            they began to charge on us ! What a hail of stones sped from their slings ! As for their
            bowmen, the javelins lay like com on the threshing floor ; all of them barbed and fire-
            hardened, which would pierce any armour and would reach the vitals where there is no
            protection ; the men with swords and shields and other arms larger than swords, such as
            broadswords, and lances, how they pressed on us and with what valour and what mighty
            shouts and yells they charged upon us ! The steady bearing of our artillery, musketeers
            and crossbow- men, was indeed a help to us, and we did the enemy much damage, and those
            of them who came close to us with their swords and broadswords met with such sword play
            from us that they were forced back and they did not close in on us so often as in the
            last battle. The horsemen were so skilful and bore themselves so valiantly that, after
            God who protected us, they were our bulwark. However, I saw that our troops were in
            considerable confusion, so that neither the shouts of Cortes nor the other captains
            availed to make them close up their ranks, and so many Indians charged down on us that
            it was only by a miracle of sword play that we could make them give way so that our
            ranks could be reformed. One thing only saved our lives, and that was that the enemy
            were so numerous and so crowded one on another that the shots wrought havoc among them,
            and in addition to this they were not well commanded, for all the captains with their
            forces could not come into action, and from what we knew, since the AGAIN DEFEATED. 239
            last battle had been fought, there had been disputes and quarrels between the Captain
            Xicotenga and another cap- tain the son of Chichimecatecle, over what the one had said
            to the other, that he had not fought well in the previous battle ; to this the son of
            Chichimecatecle replied that he had fought better [than Xicotenga] and was ready to
            prove it by personal combat. So m this battle Chichimecatecle and his men would not help
            Xicotenga, and we knew for a certainty ' that he had also called on the company of
            Huexotzinco to abstain from fighting. Besides this, ever since the last battle they were
            afraid of the horses and the musketry, and the swords and crossbows, and our hard
            fighting ; above all was the mercy of God which gave us strength to endure. So Xicotenga
            was not obeyed by two of the commanders, and we were doing great damage to his men, for
            we were killing many of them, and this they tried to conceal ; for as they were so
            numerous, whenever one of their men was wounded, they immediately bound him up and
            carried him off on their shoulders, so that in this battle, as in the last, we never saw
            a dead man. The enemy were already losing heart, and knowing that the followers of the
            other two captains whom I have already named, would not come to their assistance, they
            began to give way. It seems that in that battle we had killed one very important
            captain, not to mention others, and the enemy began to retreat in good order, our horse-
            men following them at a hand gallop for a short distance, for they could not sit their
            horses for fatigue, and when we found ourselves free from that multitude of warriors, we
            gave thanks to God. In this engagement, one soldier was killed, and sixty were wounded,
            and all the horses were wounded as well. They gave me two wounds, one in the head with a
            stone, and one in the thigh with an arrow ; but this did not pre- vent me from fighting,
            and keeping watch, and helping our 240 HARDSHIPS ENDURED BY THE SPANIARDS. soldiers, and
            all the soldiers who were wounded did the same ; for if the wounds were not very
            dangerous, we had to fight and keep guard, wounded as we were, for few of us remained
            unwounded. Then we returned to our camp, well contented, and giving thanks to God. We
            buried the dead in one of those houses which the Indians had built underground, so that
            the enemy should not see that we were mortals, but should believe that, as they said, we
            were Teules. We threw much earth over the top of the house, so that they should not
            smell the bodies, then we doctored all the wounded with the fat of the Indian, as I have
            related before. It was cold comfort to be even without salt or oil with which to cure
            the wounded. There was another want from which we suffered, and it was a severe one â
            and that was clothes with which to cover ourselves, for such a cold wind came from the
            snow mountains, that it made us shiver, for our lances and muskets and crossbows made a
            poor covering. That night we slept with more tranquillity than on the night before, when
            we had so much duty to do, with scouting, spies, watchmen and patrols. I will leave off
            here and relate what we did on the next day. In this battle we captured three Indian
            chieftains. CHAPTER LXVI. How next day we sent messeng^ers to the Caciques of Tlaxcala,
            begging them to make peace, and what they did about it After the battle which I have
            described was over, in which we had captured three Indian chieftains, our Captain Cortes
            sent them at once in company with the two others who were in our camp and who had
            already been sent as messengers, and ordered them to go to the Caciques of Tlaxcala and
            tell them that we begged them to make peace THE TLAXC ALANS CONSULT WIZARDS. 24 1 and to
            grant us a passage through their country on our way to Mexico, as we had already sent to
            request them, and to say that if they did not now come to terms, we would slay all their
            people, but that as we were well disposed towards them and wished to treat them as
            brothers, we had no desire to annoy them, unless they gave us reason to do so; and he
            said many flattering things to them so as to make friends of them, and the messengers
            then set out eagerly for the capital of Tlaxcala and gave their message to all the
            Caciques already men- tioned by me, whom they found gathered in council with many other
            elders and priests. They were very sorrowful both over the want of success in the war
            and at the death of those captains, their sons and relations, who had fallen in battle.
            As they were not very willing to listen to the message, they decided to summon all the
            soothsayers, priests, and those others called Tacal naguas (who are like wizards and
            foretell fortunes), and they told them to find out from their witchcraft, charms, and
            lots what people we were, and if by giving us battle day and night without ceasing we
            could be conquered, and to say if we were Teules, (which, as I have already said many
            times, are evil beings, like devils,) as the people of Cempoala asserted, and to tell
            them what things we ate, and ordered them to look into all these matters with the
            greatest care. When the soothsayers and wizards and many priests had got together and
            made their prophecies and forecasts, and performed all the other rites according to
            their use, it seems that they said that by their divinations they had found out we were
            men of flesh and blood and ate poultry and dogs and bread and fruit when wc had them,
            and that we did not eat the flesh nor the hearts of the Indians whom we killed. It seems
            that our Indian friends whom we had brought from Cempoala had made them believe that we
            were Teules, and that we ate the 242 NIGHT ATTACK REPULSED. hearts of Indians, and that
            the cannon shot forth lightningr, such as falls fronn heaven, and that the Lurcher,
            which was a sort of lion or tiger, and the horses, were used to catch Indians when we
            wanted to kill them, and much more nonsense of the same sort. The worst of all that the
            priests and wizards told the Caciques was, that it was not during the day, but only at
            night that we could be defeated, for as night fell, all our strength left us.
            Furthermore, their wizards told them that by day we were very valiant, and all this
            strength lasted throughout the day up to sunset, but that as soon as night came on we
            had no strength whatever. When the Caciques heard this, and they were quite convinced of
            it, they sent to tell their captain general Xicotenga that as soon as it was possible he
            should come and attack us in great force by night. On receiving this order Xicotenga
            assembled ten thousand of the bravest of his Indians and came to our camp, and from
            three sides they began alter- nately to shoot arrows and throw single pointed javelins
            from their spear throwers, and from the fourth side the swordsmen and those armed with
            macanas and broad- swords approached so suddenly, that they felt sure that they would
            carry some of us off to be sacrificed. Our Lord God provided otherwise, for secretly as
            they approached, they found us well on the alert, and as soon as our outposts and spies
            perceived the great noise of their movement, they ran at breakneck speed to give the
            alarm, and as we were all accustomed to sleep ready shod, with our arms on us and our
            horses bitted and saddled, and with all our arms ready for use, we defended ourselves
            with guns, crossbows and sword play so that they soon turned their backs. As the ground
            was level and there was a moon the horsemen followed them a little way, and in the
            morning we found lying on the plain about twenty of them dead and wounded. . So they
            went back with great loss and sorely repenting DILEMMA OF THE SPANIARDS. 243 this night
            expedition, and I have heard it said, that as what the priests and wizards had advised
            did not turn out well they sacrificed two of them. That night, one of our Indian friends
            from Cempoala was killed and two of our soldiers were wounded and one horse, and we
            captured four of the enemy. When we found that we had escaped from that impetuous attack
            we gave thanks to God, and we buried our Cempoala friend and tended the wounded and the
            horse, and slept the rest of the night after taking every precaution to protect the camp
            as was our custom. When we awoke and saw how all of us were wounded, even with two or
            three wounds, and how weary we were and how others were sick and clothed in rags, and
            knew that Xicotenga was always after us, and already over forty- five of our soldiers
            had been killed in battle, or succumbed to disease and chills, and another dozen of them
            were ill, and our Captain Cortes himself was suffering from fever as well as the Padre
            de la Merced, and what with our labours and the weight of our arms which we always
            carried on our backs, and other hardships from chills and the want of salt, for we could
            never find any to eat, we began to wonder what would be the outcome of all this
            fighting, and what we should do and where we should go when it was finished. To march
            into Mexico we thought too arduous an undertaking because of its great armies, and we
            said to one another that if those Tlaxcalans, which our Cempoalan friends had led us to
            believe were peacefully disposed, could reduce us to these straits, what would happen
            when we found ourselves at war with the great forces of Montezuma? In addition to this
            we had heard nothing from the Spaniards whom we had left settled in Villa Rica, nor they
            of us. As there were among us very excellent gentlemen and soldiers, steady and valiant
            men of good counsel, Cortes never said or did anything [important] without first asking
            K 2 244 CORTES ENCOURAGED BY HIS FOLLOWERS well considered advice, and acting in concert
            with us. Although the historian Gomara says Cortes did this and that, and came here and
            went there, and says many other things without reason, even if Cortes were made of iron,
            as Gomara in his history says he was, he could not be everywhere at once. Suffice it to
            say that he bore himself like a good commander. This I say, for after all the great
            mercies which our Lord granted us in all our doings, and in the late victories, and in
            everything else, it seems that God gave us soldiers grace and good counsel to advise
            Cortes how to do all things in the right way. Let us cease praising and cease speaking
            of past praises, for they do not add much to our history, and let me relate how one and
            all we put heart into Cortes, and told him that he must get well again and reckon upon
            us, and that as with the help of God we had escaped from such perilous battles, our Lord
            Jesus Christ must have preserved us for some good end ; that he [Cortes] should at once
            set our prisoners free and send them to the head Caciques already named by me, so as to
            bring them to peace, when all that had taken place would be pardoned, including the
            death of the mare. Let us leave this and say how Dofia Marina who, although a native
            woman, possessed such manly valour that, although she had heard every day how the
            Indians were going to kill us and eat our flesh with chili, and had seen us surrounded
            in the late battles, and knew that all of us were wounded and sick, yet never allowed us
            to see any sign of fear in her, only a courage passing that of woman. So Dona Marina and
            JerÃ³nimo de Aguilar spoke to the messengers whom we were now sending and told them that
            they must come and make peace at once, and that if it was not concluded within two days
            we should go and kill them all and destroy their country and would come to seek them in
            their city, and with these brave words they were dispatched SENDS AN EMBASSY TO
            TLAXCALA. 245 to the capital where Xicotenga the elder and Mase Escasi were [residing].
            Let us leave this, and I will mention another thing that I have noticed, that the
            historian Gomara does not mention or make any record in his history of the fact that any
            of us were killed or wounded, or underwent any hardships, or suffered, but writes about
            it all as though we were going to a wedding, and it is thus that we find it recorded. Oh
            ! â how badly those men advised him when they told him to put such things in his history
            ! It has made all of us con- querors reflect upon what he wrote down, which not being
            true, he ought to have remembered, that as soon as we saw his history we must out with
            the truth ! Let us forget Gomara and say that our messengers went to the capital of
            Tlaxcala with our message, and I think that they carried a letter, for although we knew
            they could not understand it, yet they would look on it as an order, and with it was
            sent an arrow, and they found the two chief Caciques who were in conference with the.
            other chieftains, and what they answered I will go on to relate. CHAPTER LXVII. How we
            again sent messengers to the Caciques of Tlaxcala to bring them to peace, and what they
            did about it and decided. When the messengers whom we had sent to treat for peace
            arrived at Tlaxcala, they found the two principal Caciques in consultation, namely :
            Mase Escasi and Xico- tenga, the elder (the father of the Captain General Xicotenga, so
            often mentioned by me, who bore the same name). When they had heard the embassy, they
            were undecided and kept silence for a few moments, and it pleased God to guide their
            thoughts towards making peace 246 THE (ÃACIQUÃS DELIBERATE. with US ; and they sent at
            once to summon all the other Caciques and captains who were in their towns, and those of
            a neighbouring province called Huexotzingo who were their friends and allies, and when
            all had come together to the town where they were, which was their capital, Mase Escasi
            and Xicotenga the elder, who were very wise men, made them a speech, as we afterwards
            learned, to the following effect, if not exactly in these words : " Brothers and
            friends, you have already seen how many times these Teules who are in this country
            expecting to be attacked, have sent us messengers asking us to make peace, saying that
            they come to assist us and adopt us as brothers ; and you have also seen how many times
            they have taken prisoners numbers of our vassals to whom they do no harm, and whom they
            quickly set free. You well know how we have three times attacked them with all our
            forces, both by day and by night, and have failed to conquer them, and that they have
            killed during the attacks we made on them, many of our people, and of our sons,
            relations and captains. Now, again, they have sent to ask us to make peace and the
            people of Cempoala whom they are bringing in their company say that they are the enemies
            of Montezuma and his Mexicans, and have ordered the towns of the Totonac sierra and
            those of Cempoala no longer to pay tribute to Montezuma. You will remember well enough
            that the Mexicans make war on us every year, and have done so for more than a hundred
            years, and you can readily see that we are hemmed in in our own lands, so that we do not
            dare to go outside even to seek for salt, so that we have none to eat, and we have no
            cotton, and bring in very little cotton cloth, and if some of our people go out or have
            gone out to seek for it, few of them return alive, for those traitorous Mexicans and
            their allies kill them or make slaves of them. Our wizards^ and sooth- ^ Tacal naguas.
            XICOTENGA tttE VOUNGER kEFkACTORV. 247 sayers and priests have told us what they think
            about the persons of these Teules, and that they are very valiant. It seems to me that
            we should seek to be friends with them, and in either case, whether they be men or
            Teules, that we should make them welcome, and that four of our chieftains should set out
            at once and take them plenty to eat, and should offer them friendship and peace, so that
            they should assist us' and defend us against our enemies, and let us bring them here to
            us, and give them women, so that we may have relationship with their offspring, for the
            ambassadors whom they have sent to treat for peace, tell us that they have some women
            with them." When they had listened to this discourse, all the Caciques and chiefs
            approved of it and said that it was a wise decision and that peace should be made at
            once, and that notice should be sent to the Captain Xicotenga and the other captains who
            were with him to return at once and not to attack again, and that they should be told
            that peace was already made, and messengers were immediately sent off to announce it.
            However, the Captain Xicotenga the younger would not listen to the four chiefs, and got
            very angry and used abusive language against them, and said he was not for peace, for he
            had already killed many of the Teules and a mare, and that he wished to attack us again
            by night and completely conquer us and slay us. When his father, Xicotenga the elder,
            and Mase Escasi and the other Caciques heard this reply they were very angry, and sent
            orders at once to the captains and to all the army that they should not join Xicotenga
            in attacking us again, and should not obey him in anything that he ordered unless it was
            in making peace. And even so he would not obey, and when they [the Caciques] saw the
            disobedience of their captain, they at once sent the same four chieftains whom they had
            sent before, to bring food to our camp and treat for peace in the name of all 24^
            feXPEbÃTION to Tlaxcala and Huexotzingo, but, from fear of Xicotenga the younger, the
            four old men did not come at that time, and as two or three things happened at the same
            moment, both in our camp and in the treating for peace, and as I must take in hand that
            which seems most convenient, I will cease speaking about the four Indian chieftains who
            were sent to treat for peace but did not dare to come for fear of Xicotenga, for at this
            time we went with Cortes to a town near our camp, and what happened I will tell in the
            next chapter. CHAPTER LXVIII. How we agreed to go to a town which was near to our camp,
            and what we did about it. As two days had passed without our doing anything worthy of
            record, we suggested to Cortes, and it was agreed to, that as there was a town about one
            league distant from our camp which had sent no reply when summoned to make peace, that
            we should march against it by night and take it by surprise, nt)t with intent to do it
            any harm, I mean not to kill or wound its inhabitants, or take them prisoners, but to
            carry off food and to frighten or talk them into making peace, according to the way they
            might act. This town was called Tzumpantzingo,^ and was the capital of many other small
            towns, and the township where our camp was placed, which was called Tecoad^unpan^ingo,
            was subject to it, and all round about it was thickly peopled. So one night, long before
            the approach of dawn, we rose early to go to that town with six of the best horsemen and
            â¢ ^ (y!unpanzingo in the original. tZUMPAtÃ­TZlKGO 249 the healthiest of the soldiers and
            ten crossbowmen and eight musketeers, with Cortes as our captain, although he was
            suffering from tertian fever, and we icft the camp as well guarded as was possible. We
            started on our march two hours before dawn came, and there was such a cold wind that
            morning blowing down from the snowy mountains that it made us shiver and shake, and the
            horses we had with us felt it keenly, for two of them were seized with colic and were
            trembling all over, which worried us a good deal as we feared that they would die.
            Cortes ordered their owners to take them back to the camp and try to cure them. As the
            town was not far off we arrived there before day- light, and when the natives perceived
            our approach, they fled from their houses shouting to one another to look out for the
            Teules who were coming to kill them, and the parents, in their panic, did not even wait
            to look after their children. When we saw what was happening, we halted- in a court
            until it was daylight, so as not to do the people any harm. As soon as the priests who
            were in the temples, the elders of the town and some of the old chieftains saw that we
            stood there without doing any harm, they came to Cortes and asked his pardon for not
            coming to our camp peacefully and bringing food when we had summoned them to do so, the
            reason being that the captain Xico- tenga, who was in the neighbourhood, had sent to
            them to say that they should not give us any, because his camp was supplied from that
            town and from many others, and he had with him as warriors the sons of the people of
            that town and from all the territory of Tlaxcala. Cortes told them through our
            interpreters, Dofia Marina and Aguilar, who always went with us on every expedition â
            even when it took place at night â to have no fear, but to go at once to the Caciques at
            the capital and tell them to come and make peace, for the war was disastrous to them,
            250 SUPPLIES Of FOOD SECURED. and he [Cortes] sent those [same] priests [as messengers],
            for, by the other messengers whom we had sent we had so far received no reply whatever.
            Concerning the circum- stance I have mentioned of the Caciques of Tlaxcala sending four
            chieftains to treat for peace, up to that time these had not arrived. These priests of
            the town quickly searched for more than forty cocks and hens and two women to grind
            tortillas, and brought them to us, and Cortes thanked them for it, and ordered them at
            once to send twenty Indians to our camp, and they came with the food without any fear
            whatever and stayed in the camp until the afternoon, and they were given little beads
            with which they returned well contented to their homes, and in all the small hamlets in
            our neigh- bourhood they spread word that we were good because we caused them no
            annoyance, and the priests and elders sent notice to the captain Xicotenga and told him
            how they had given us the food and the women, and he rated them severely, and they went
            at once to the capital to make it known to the o[d Caciques. As soon as they heard that
            we had not done the people any harm, although we might have killed many of them that
            night, and that we were sending them to treat for peace, they were greatly pleased, and
            ordered that we should be supplied every day with all that we needed ; and they again
            ordered the four Caciques, whom they had before charged with the mission of peace, to
            depart instantly for our camp, and carry with them all the food that had been prepared.
            We then returned to our camp with our supplies of food and the Indian women, all of us
            well contented. I must leave oflf here and relate what passed in the camp while we were
            gone away to that town. blSSÃKSÃÃN tN THE CAMP. 25 1 CHAPTER LXIX. How when we returned
            with Cortes from Tzumpantzingo* with supplies, we found certain discussions being
            carried on in our camp, and what Cortes replied to them. When we returned from
            Tzumpantzingo,* as the town is called, with our supplies of food, very contented at
            leaving the place pacified, we found that in camp there had been meetings and
            discussions about the very great danger we were running day by day during this war, and
            on our arrival the discussion grew most lively. Those who talked most and were most
            persistent, were those who had left houses and assignments of Indians behind them in
            Cuba, and as many as seven of these men (whose names I will not mention so as to save
            their honour) met together and went to the hut where Cortes was lodging, and one of them
            who spoke for all, for he was very fluent of speech and knew very well what they had
            come to propose, said, as though he were giving advice to Cortes, that he should take
            heed of the condition we were in, wounded and thin and half- hearted, and the great
            hardships that we endured by night as sentinels and spies, or patrols and scouts, and
            both by day and night in fighting. According to the accounts he had made up, since
            leaving Cuba we had lost over fifty-five of our comrades, and knew nothing about those
            whom we had left as settlers at Villa Rica ; and although God had given us victory in
            the battles and skirmishes since we came from Cuba to this province and by His great
            pity had sustained us, we ought not to tempt Him so many times, and might it not turn
            out worse than Pedro Carbonero* ; that he [Cortes] had got us into an ' Cinpanqingo in
            the original. ^ (^unpanzingo in the original. ' Spoken proverbially of Pedro Carbonero,
            w^ho penetrated into the land of the Moors, but failed to return, and perished there

            situation, and that some day or other we should be sacrificed to the idols, which please
            God would not happen ; but that it would be a good thing to return to our town and the
            fortress which we had built, and stay among the towns of our friends the Totonacs until
            we could build a ship which should be dispatched to Diego Velasquez and to other parts
            and islands to ask them to send us help and assistance ; and that now the ships which we
            sunk would have been useful to us, and we might have left at least two of them in case
            of necessity arising, but without consulting them about this, or about anything else, by
            the advice of those who did not know how to provide for changes of fortune, he [Cortes]
            had ordered them all to be sunk, and please God that he and those who had given him such
            advice would not repent of it ; that we were no longer able to support the burden much
            less the many overburdens [which we were carrying] and that we were going along worse
            than beasts of burden ; for when a beast has done its day's work its packsaddle is taken
            off and it is given food and rest ; but we went booted and loaded down with our arms
            both by day and night ; and they told Cortes besides that he could see in any history
            that neither the Romans nor Alexander, nor any other of the most famous captains whom
            the world had known, had dared to destroy their ships and with such a small force throw
            themselves against such a great popu- lation with so many warriors as he had done, and
            that it wt>uld be the cause of his own death and that of all his . followers ; that he
            should wish to preserve his life and the lives of us all, and that we should at once
            return to Villa Rica as the country there was at peace ; that they had not said all this
            before, as there had been no time to do so on account of the many warriors who were
            opposed to us every day, both in front and on our flanks ; and although they had not
            returned to the attack they believed that they CORTES REPLIES. 253 would do SO, and
            since Xicotenga with his great power had not been to look for us during the last three
            days, that he must be collecting his forces and we ought not to await another battle
            like the last ; and they said more to the same effect. Cortes noticing that they spoke
            somewhat haughtily, considering that their words took the form of unasked advice,
            answered them very gently and said that he was aware of many of the things that they had
            mentioned, and that from what he had seen and believed, there was not in the whole world
            another [company of] Spaniards who were hardier, or who had fought with greater courage,
            or had endured such excessive hardships as we had, and that if we had not marched with
            arms continually on our backs, and kept watch, and gone on patrol, and suffered cold,
            and if we had not done all this we should already have perished, and that it was to save
            our lives that we had to endure those hardships and even greater ones, and he said : "
            Why, sirs, should we talk about deeds of valour when in truth our Lord is pleased to
            help us ? When I remember seeing us surrounded by so many companies of the enemy and
            watching the play of their broadswords so close to us, it even now terrifies me,
            especially when they killed the mare with a single sword cut ; we indeed seemed to be
            defeated and lost, and then I appreciated your great courage more than ever. As God then
            freed us from such great danger, so I have trust in Him that He will do the same in the
            future ; and I will say more â that in all such dangers you will find no slackness on my
            part when I share them with you." He had good reason to say so for in all the battles he
            was to be found in the front. ** I wish you, sirs, to bear in mind, that as our Lord has
            been pleased to help us, we have hope that so it may be in the future, for ever since we
            have penetrated into this country, in all the towns we have passed through, we have
            preached 254 CORTÃS REPLIES. the holy doctrine as well as we were able, and have induced
            the Indians to destroy their idols. As we already see that neither Xicotenga nor his
            captains put in an appearance and that they are afraid to return, for we must have done
            them great damage in the late battles, and that they are not able to assemble their
            followers, as they have already been defeated three times"; for these reasons he had
            confidence in God and his advocate, San Pedro, who prays for us, that the war in this
            province is ended. " Now, as you have seen, the people of Cinpancingo are bringing food
            and have made peace and so have our neighbours here who have returned to live in their
            houses." As for the destruction of the ships, it was very well advised, and that if some
            of them were not consulted in the matter, as the other gentlemen were, it was because he
            [Cortes] resented what happened on the beach, which he did not now wish to call to mind
            ; that the opinion and advice which they now gave him was on a par with that which they
            gave on that occasion ; that they could see that there were many other gentlemen in the
            camp who strongly opposed what they were now asking and advising, and that it would be
            better to trust all matters to God and to follow them up in His holy service. " As to
            what you say, sirs, that the most renowned Roman captains have never done such great
            deeds as we have â ^you tell the truth. And from now onwards, God helping us, they will
            say in the histories that record these events far more than they may have said about
            those that happened before ; so, as I have already said, all our labours are devoted to
            the service of God and our great Emperor Don Carlos, and under his true justice and
            Christianity will be aided by the mercy of our Lord, and He will support us as we go
            from good to better. So, gentlemen, it is clearly no good to go back a single step, for
            if these people and those whom we leave behind in peace were to see us in retreat, the
            very stones would rise up CORTÃ¡S REPLIES. 255 against us. As at the present time they
            take us for gods and idols, and so call us, they would then look on us as cowards and
            weaklings." " As for what you say about staying among the friendly Totonacs, our allies,
            if they should see us return without going to Mexico, they would rise against us, and
            the reason for this would be that, as we stopped them from paying tribute to Montezuma,
            he would send his Mexican forces against them to bring them again under tribute and make
            war on them and would order them to make war on us, and they, so as to escape
            destruction, for they greatly fear the Mexicans, would soon set to work ; so that where
            we expected to have friends we would find enemies. Then as soon as the great Montezuma
            learned that we had retreated, what would he say ? What would he think of our words, and
            of what we sent to tell him ? That it was all a joke or child's play. So, gentlemen, if
            one way is bad, the other way is worse, and it is better to stay where we are, where
            there is open ground thickly inhabited, and our camp is well supplied with food,
            sometimes poultry, at others dogs, and thank God there is no lack of food. And I wish we
            had salt âwhich is our greatest want at present, and clothes to protect us from the
            cold. As to what you say, sirs, that we have lost fifty-five soldiers, since we left the
            Island of Cuba, from wounds, starvation, cold, illness and hardship, and that we are now
            few in number and all sick and wounded, God gives us the strength of a host ; it is
            clearly a fact that wars use up men and horses, and that sometimes we feed well, but we
            did not come here to rest ourselves, but to fight when opportunity offered. There- fore,
            I pray you, sirs, have the goodness to act like gentlemen, as persons who are used to
            put courage into those you may see showing weakness, and from now on give up thinking of
            the Island of Cuba and what you left there, and try to do what you have hitherto always
            doneâ 256 THE DISCUSSION ENDED. your duty â as good soldiers ; for after God, who is
            your aid and support, we must rely on our own strong arms." When Cortes had given this
            reply, those soldiers renewed their argument. They admitted that all that Cortes had
            told them had been well said, but that when we left the town where we had made a
            settlement, our intention was, and now still is, to go to Mexico, which has such a great
            reputation on account of the strength of the city and its great number of warriors. The
            people of Cempoala said that the Tlaxcalans were a peaceful people, and they had no such
            reputation as those of Mexico, yet we had been in great danger of losing our lives, and
            if they should attack us next day in another battle such as those we had gone through,
            we were too exhausted to hold our own. If they did not attack us again, still the
            journey to Mexico seemed to them a very terrible thing, and that he should reconsider
            what he was saying and commanding. Cortes answered half angrily that " It was better to
            die in a good cause, as the Psalms said, than to live dis- honoured 1 " And in addition
            to this which Cortes told them, the greater number of the soldiers, those who had
            elected Cortes captain, and had given him counsel about destroying the ships, cried out
            loudly that he should not trouble himself about gossip or listen to such tales, for with
            the help of God, by acting well together, we should be ready to do the right thing, and
            so all the talk ended. It is true enough that they grumbled at Cortes and cursed him,
            and even at us who had advised him, and at the Cempoalans who had brought us here, and
            said other unworthy things, but in such times they were overlooked. Finally all were
            fairly obedient, and I will leave off talking about this, and will relate how the aged
            Caciques again sent messengers from the capital of Tlaxcala to their captain general
            Xicotenga to say that without fail he should immediately visit us in peace and bring us
            food, A MESSAGE FROM XICOTENGA THE YOUNGER. 257 for SO it was decreed by all the
            caciques and chieftains of their land and of Huexotzingo. They also sent to order the
            captains who were in Xicotenga's company, to refuse him all obedience if he did not go
            and make peace. This they sent to say three times, for they knew for certain that
            Xicotenga did not wish to obey them, but was de- termined once again to attack our camp
            by night, and for this purpose had assembled twenty thousand men, and being haughty and
            very stubborn, that now, as at other times, he would not obey. What he did in the matter
            I will tell further on. CHAPTER LXX. How the Captain Xicotenga had got ready twenty
            thousand picked warriors to attack our camp and what was done about it. When Mase Escasi
            and Xicotenga the elder, and the greater number of the Caciques of the capital of
            Tlaxcala sent four times to tell their captain not to attack us but to go and treat for
            peace, he was very close to our camp, and they sent to the other captains who were with
            him and told them not to follow him unless it was to accompany him when he went to see
            us peacefully. As Xicotenga was bad tempered and obstinate and proud, he decided to send
            forty Indians with food, poultry, bread and fruit and four miserable looking old Indian
            women, and much copal and many parrots' feathers. From their appearance we thought that
            the Indians who brought this present came with peaceful intentions, and when they
            reached our camp they fumigated Cortes with incense without doing him reverence, as was
            usually their custom. They said : " The Captain Xicotenga sends you all this so that you
            can eat. If you are savage Teules, as the Cempoalans say you are, and if you wish for a
            sacrifice, 5 2SS THE MESSENGERS FROM XICOTENGA take these four women and sacrifice them
            and you can eat their flesh and hearts, but as we do not know your manner of doing it,
            we have not sacrificed them now before you ; but if you are men, eat the poultry and the
            bread and fruit, and if you are tame Teules we have brought you copal (which I have
            already said is a sort of incense) and parrots' feathers ; make your sacrifice with
            that" Cortes answered through our interpreters that he had already sent to them to say
            that he desired peace and had not come to make war, but had come to entreat them and
            make clear to them on behalf of our Lord Jesus Christ, whom we believe in and worship,
            and of the Emperor Don Carlos, whose vassals we are, that they should not kill or
            sacrifice anyone as was their custom to do. That we were all men of bone and flesh just
            as they were, and not Teules but Christians, and that it was not our custom to kill any-
            one ; that had we wished to kill people, many opportunities of perpetrating cruelties
            had occurred during the frequent attacks they had made on us, both by day and night.
            That for the food they had brought he gave them thanks, and that they were not to be as
            foolish as they had been, but should now make peace. It seems that these Indians whom
            Xicotenga had sent with the food were spies sent to examine our huts and ranchos, and
            horses and artillery and [to report] how many of us there were in each hut, our comings
            and goings, and everything else that could be seen in the camp. They re- mained there
            that day and the following night, and some of them went with messages to Xicotenga and
            others arrived. Our friends whom we had brought with us from Cempoala looked on and
            bethought them that it was not a customary thing for our enemies to stay in the camp day
            and njght without any purpose, and it was clear to them that they were spies, and they
            were the more suspicious of them in that when we went on the expedition to the little
            town of PROVE TO BE SPIES. 259 Tzumpantzingo, two old men of that town had told the
            Cempoalans that Xicotenga was all ready with a large number of warriors to attack our
            camp by night, in such a way that their approach would not be detected, and the
            Cempoalans at that time took it for a joke or bravado, and not believing it they had
            said nothing to Cortes ; but Dofia Marina heard of it at once and she repeated it to
            Cortes. So as to learn the truth, Cortes had two of the most honest looking of the
            Tlaxcalans taken apart from the others, and they confessed that they were spies ; then
            two others were taken and they also confessed that they were spies from Xicotenga and
            the reason why they had come. Cortes ordered them to be released, and we took two more
            of them and they confessed that they were neither more nor less than spies, but added
            that their Captain Xicotenga was awaiting their report to attack us that night with all
            his companies. When Cortes heard this he let it be known throughout the camp that we
            were to keep on the alert, believing that they would attack as had been arranged. Then
            he had seventeen of those spies captured and cut off the hands of some and the thumbs of
            others and sent them to the Captain Xicotenga to tell him that he had had them thus
            punished for daring to come in such a way, and to tell him that he might come when he
            chose by day or by night, for we should await him here two days, and that if he did not
            come within those two days that we would go and look for him in his camp, and that we
            would already have gone to attack them and kill them, were it not for the liking we had
            for them, and that now they should quit their foolishness and make peace. They say that
            it was at the very moment that those Indians set out with their hands and thumbs cut
            off, that Xicotenga wished to set out from his camp with all his forces to attack us by
            night as had been arranged ; but when he saw his spies returning in this manner he
            wondered S 2 26o AN EMBASSY FROM TLAXCALA greatly and asked the reason of it, and they
            told him all that had happened, and from this time forward he lost his courage and
            pride, and in addition to this one of his commanders with whom he had wrangles and
            disagree- ments during the battles which had been fought, had left the camp with all his
            men. Let us get on with our story. CHAPTER LXXI. How the four chieftains who had been
            sent to treat for peace arrived in our camp and the speech they made, and what else
            happened. While we were in camp not knowing that they would come in peace, as we had so
            greatly desired, and were busy polishing our arms and making arrows, each one of us
            doing what was necessary to prepare for battle, at that moment one of our scouts came
            hurrying in to say that many Indian men and women with loads were coming along the high
            road from Tlaxcala, and without leaving the road were making for our camp, and that the
            other scout, his companion, who was on horseback, was watching to see which way they
            went ; meanwhile the other scout, his companion, who was on horseback, arrived and said
            that the people were close by and coming straight in our direction, and every now and
            then were making short stops. Cortes and all of us were delighted at this news, for we
            believed that it meant peace, as in fact it did, and Cortes ordered us to make no
            display of alarm and not to show any concern, but to stay hidden in our huts. Then, from
            out of all those people who came bearing loads, the four chieftains advanced who were
            charged to treat for peace, according to the instructions given by the old caciques.
            Making signs of peace by bowing the head, they came straight to the hut where Cortes was
            lodging and BEGGING FOR PEACE. 26 1 placed one hand on the ground and kissed the earth
            and three times made obeisance and burnt copal, and said that all the Caciques of
            Tlaxcala and their allies and vassals, friends and confederates, were come to place
            themselves under the friendship and peace of Cortes and of his brethren the Teules who
            accompanied him. They asked his pardon for not having met us peacefully, and for the war
            which they had waged on us, for they had believed and held for certain that we were
            friends of Montezuma and his Mexicans, who have been their mortal enemies from times
            long past, for they saw that many of his vassals who paid him tribute had come in our
            company, and they believed that they were endeavouring to gain an entry into their
            country by guile and treachery, as was their custom to do, so as to rob them of their
            women and children ; and this was the reason why they did not believe the messengers
            whom we had sent to them. In addition to this they said that the Indians who had first
            gone forth to make war on us as we entered their country had "Slone it without their
            orders or advice, but by that of the Chuntales^ Estomies, who were wild people and very
            stupid, and that when they saw that we were so few in number, they thought to capture us
            and carry us off as prisoners to their lords and gain thanks for so doing ; that now
            they came to beg pardon for their audacity, and had brought us food, and that every day
            they would bring more and trusted that we would receive it with the friendly feeling
            with which it was sent ; that within two days the captain Xicotenga would come with
            other Caciques and give a * " Chontal in the Mexican language means barbarous,"
            Relaciones de Yucatan^ vol. ii, p. 342 ; it here means the barbarous Otomis. The Otomis,
            according to Aztec tradition, were the earliest owners of the soil in Central Mexico ;
            their headquarters were in what are now known as the States of Queretaro and Guanajuato,
            but there were Otomi communities living among other tribes in many parts of Central
            Mexico. 202 AN EMBASSY FROM TLAXCALA. further account of the sincere wish of all
            Tlaxcala to enjoy our friendship. As soon as they had finished their discourse they
            bowed their heads and placed their hands on the ground and kissed the earth. Then Cortes
            spoke to them through our interpreters very seriously, pretending he was angry, and said
            that there were reasons why we should not listen to them and should reject their
            friendship, for as soon as we had entered their country we sent to them offering peace
            and had told them that we wished to assist them against their enemies, the Mexicans, and
            they would not believe it and wished to kill our ambassadors ; and not content with
            that, they had attacked us three times both by day and by night, and had spied on us and
            held us under observation ; and in the attacks which they made on us we might have
            killed many of their vassals, but he would not, and he grieved for those who were killed
            ; but it was their own fault and he had made up his mind to go to the place where the
            old chiefs were living and to attack them ; but as they had now sought peace in the name
            of that province, he would receive them in the name of our lord the King and thank them
            for the food they had brought. He told them to go at once to their chieftains and tell
            them to come or send to treat for peace with fuller powers, and that if they did not
            come we would go to their town and attack them. He ordered them to be given some blue
            beads to be handed to their Caciques as a sign of peace, and he warned them that when
            they came to our camp it should be by day and not by night, lest we should kill them.
            Then those four messengers departed, and left in some Indian houses a little apart from
            our camp, the Indian women whom they had brought to make bread, some poultry, and all
            the necessaries for service, and twenty Indians to bring wood and water. From now on
            they SOME COMMENTS ON GOMARA'S HISTORY. 263 brought us plenty to eat, and when we saw
            this and believed that peace was a reality, we gave great thanks to God for it. It had
            come in the nick of time, for we were already lean and worn out and discontented with
            the war, not knowing or being able to forecast what would be the end of it. In the past
            chapters the historian Gomara says that Cortes ascended some cliffs and saw the town of
            Tzum- pantzingo. I repeat that it was close by our camp and that the soldier must have
            been very blind who wishing to see it could not see it and see it very clearly. He also
            says that the soldiers wanted to mutiny and rebel, and he says other things which I do
            not care to write down, as it is a waste of words. I say that never in the world was a
            captain obeyed with more respect and punctuality, as will be seen further on. No such
            thought entered into the head of a single soldier from the time we marched inland,
            unless it was on the one occasion of the sand dunes. The words which were said in this
            last chapter were by way of advice and because it seemed to them that they were right
            and not for any other reason, for the men always followed him truly and loyally. Whoever
            sees Gomara's history will believe it to be true, as it is expressed with such
            eloquence, although it is quite the reverse of what really took place. I will leave off
            here and will go on to tell what took place later, about some messengers sent by the
            great Montezuma. 204 AN EMBASSY FROM MONTEZUMA. CHAPTER LXXII. How ambassadors from
            Montezuma, the great lord of Mexico, came to our camp, and of the present which they
            brought. As our Lord God, through his great loving kindness, was pleased to give us
            victory in those battles in Tlaxcala, our fame spread throughout the surrounding
            country, and reached the ears of the great Montezuma in the great City of Mexico ; and
            if hitherto they took us for Teules, which is the same as their idols, from now on they
            held us in even greater respect as valiant warriors, and terror fell on the whole
            country at learning how, being so few in number and the Tlaxcalans in such great force,
            we had conquered them and that they had sued us for peace. So that now Montezuma, the
            great Prince of Mexico, powerful as he was, was in fear of our going to his city, and
            sent five chieftains, men of much importance, to our camp at Tlaxcala to bid us welcome,
            and say that he was rejoiced at our great victory against so many squadrons of warriors,
            and he sent a present, a matter of a thousand dollars worth of gold, in very rich
            jewelled ornaments, worked in various shapes, and twenty loads of fine cotton cloth, and
            he sent word that he wished to become the vassal of our great Emperor, and that he was
            pleased that we were already near his city, on account of the good will that he bore
            Cortes and all his brothers, the Teules, who were with him (for so they called us) and
            that he [Cortes] should decide how much tribute he wished for every year for our great
            Emperor, and that he [Montezuma] would give it in gold and silver, cloth and
            chalchihuites, provided we would not come to Mexico. This was not because he would not
            receive us with the greatest willingness, but because the land was rough and sterile,
            and he would regret to see us undergo such hardships which perchance he might not
            XICOTENGA VISITS CORTES. 265 be able to alleviate as well as he could wish. Cortes
            answered by saying that he highly appreciated the good will shown us, and the present
            which had been sent, and the offer to pay tribute to his Majesty, and he begged the
            messengers not to depart until he went to the capital of Tlaxcala, as he would despatch
            them from that place, for they could then see how that war ended, and he did not wish to
            give them his reply at once, because he had pui^ed himself the day before with some
            camomiles such as are found in the Island of Cuba, and are very good for one who knows
            how to take them. I will leave this subject and tell what else happened in our camp.
            CHAPTER LXXIII. How Xicotenga, the Captain General of Tlaxcala, came to treat for peace,
            and what he said and what he settled with us. Cortes was talking to the ambassadors of
            Montezuma, as I have already said, and wanted to take some rest, for he was ill with
            fever and had purged himself the day before, when they came to tell him that the Captain
            Xicotenga was arriving with many other Caciques and Captains, all clothed in white and
            red cloaks, half of the cloak was white and the other half red, for this was the device
            and livery of Xicotenga, [who was approaching] in a very peaceful manner, and was
            bringing with* him in his company about fifty chieftains. When Xicotenga reached
            CortÃ©s's quarters he paid him the greatest respect by his obeisance, and ordered much
            copal to be burned. Cortes, with the greatest show of affection, seated him by his side
            and Xicotenga said that he came on behalf of his father and of Mase Escasi and all the
            Caciques, and Commonwealth of Tlaxcala to pray Cortes 266 xicotenga's speech. to admit
            them to our. friendship, and that he came to render obedience to our King and Lord, and
            to ask pardon for having taken up arms and made war upon us. That this had been done
            because they did not know who we were, and they had taken it for certain that we had
            come on behalf of their enemy Montezuma, and as it frequently happened that craft and
            cunning was used to gain entrance to their country so as to rob and pillage it, they had
            believed that this was now the case, and for that reason had endeavoured to defend
            themselves and their country, and were obliged to show fight He said that they were a
            very poor people who possessed neither gold, nor silver, nor precious stones, nor cotton
            cloth, nor even salt to eat, because Montezuma gave them no opportunity to go out and
            search for it, and that although their ancestors pos- sessed some gold and precious
            stones, they had been given to Montezuma on former occasions when, to save them- selves
            from destruction, they had made peace or a truce, and this had been in times long past ;
            so that if they had nothing to give now, we must pardon them for it, for poverty and not
            the want of good will was the cause of it. He made many complaints of Montezuma and his
            allies who were all hostile to them and made war on them, but they had defended
            themselves very well. Now they had thought to do the same against us, but they could not
            do it although they had gathered against us three times with all their warriors, and we
            must be invincible, and when they found this out about our persons they wished to become
            friends with us and the vassals of the great prince the Emperor Don Carlos, for they
            felt sure that in our company they and their women and children would be guarded and
            protected, and would not live in dread of the Mexican traitors, and he said many other
            words placing themselves and their city at our disposal. Xicotenga was tall, broad
            shouldered and well made; PEACE MADE WITH TLAXCALA. 267 his face was long, pockmarked
            and coarse, he was about thirty-five years old and of a dignified deportment. Cortes
            thanked him very courteously, in a most flattering manner, and said that he would accept
            them as vassals of our King and Lord, and as our own friends. Then Xico- tenga begged us
            to come to his city, for all the Caciques, elders and priests were waiting to receive us
            with great rejoicing. Cortes replied that he would go there promptly, and would start at
            once, were it not for some negotiations which he was carrying on with the great
            Montezuma, and that he would come after he had despatched the mes- sengers. Then Cortes
            spoke somewhat more sharply and severely about the attacks they had made on us both by
            day and night, adding that as it could not now be mended he would pardon it. Let them
            see to it that the peace we now were granting them was an enduring one, without any
            change, for otherwise he would kill them and destroy their city and that he [Xicotenga]
            should not expect further talk about peace, but only of war. When Xicotenga and all the
            chieftains who had come with him heard these words they answered one and all, that the
            peace would be firm and true, and that to prove it they would all remain with us as
            hostages. There was further conversation between Cortes and Xicotenga and most of his
            chiefs, and they were given blue and green beads for Xicotenga's father, for himself,
            and for the other Caciques, and were told to report that Cortes would soon set out for
            their city. The Mexican Ambassadors were present during all these discussions and heard
            all the promises that were made, and the conclusion of peace weighed on them heavily,
            for they fully understood that it boded them no good. And when Xicotenga had taken his
            leave these Ambassadors of Montezuma half laughingly asked Cortes whether he be- lieved
            any of those promises which were made on behalf 208 CORRESI*ONDENCE WITH ESCALANTE, of
            all TIaxcala, [alleging] that it was all a trick which de- served no credence, and the
            words were those of traitors and deceivers ; that their object was to attack and kill us
            as soon as they had us within their city in a place where they could do so in safety ;
            that we should bear in mind how often they had put forth all their strength to destroy
            us and had failed to do so, and had lost many killed and wounded, and that now they
            offered a sham peace so as to avenge themselves. Cortes answered them, with a brave
            face, that their alleged belief that such was the case did not trouble him, for even if
            it were true he would be glad of it so as to . punish them [the Tlaxcalans] by taking
            their lives, that it did not matter to him whether they attacked him by day or by night,
            in the city or in the open, he did not mind one way or the other, and it was for the
            purpose of seeing whether they were telling the truth that he was determined to go to
            their city. The Ambassadors seeing that he had made up his mind begged him to wait six
            days in our camp as they wished to send two of their companions with a message to their
            Lord Montezuma, and said that they would return with a reply within six days. To this
            Cortes agreed, on the one hand because, as I have said he was suffering from fever, and
            on the other because, although when the Ambassadors had made these statements he had
            appeared to attach no importance to them, he thought that there was a chance of their
            being true, and that until there was greater certainty of peace, they were of a nature
            requiring much consideration. As at the time that this peace was made the towns all
            along the road that we had traversed from our Villa Rica de Vera Cruz were allied to us
            and friendly, Cortes wrote to Juan de Escalante who, as I have said, remained in the
            town to finish building the fort, and had under his command the sixty old or sick
            soldiers who had been left behind. WHO WAS AT VILLA RICA. 269 In these letters he told
            them of the great mercies which our Lord Jesus Christ had vouchsafed to us in the
            victories which we had gained in our battles and encounters since we had entered the
            province of Tlaxcala, which had now sued for peace with us, and asked that all of them
            would give thanks to God for it. He also told them to see to it that they always kept on
            good terms with our friends in the towns of the Totonacs, and he told him to send at
            once two jars of wine which had been left behind, buried in a certain marked place in
            his lodgings, and some sacred wafers for the Mass, which had been brought from the
            Island of Cuba, for those which we had brought on this expedition were already finished.
            These letters were most welcome, and Escalante wrote in reply to say what had happened
            in the town, and all that was asked for arrived very quickly. About this time we set up
            a tall and sumptuous cross in our camp, and Cortes ordered the Indians of Tzum-
            pantzingo and those who dwelt in the houses near our camp to whitewash it, and it was
            beautifully finished. I must cease writing about this and return to our new friends the
            Caciques of Tlaxcala, who when they saw that we did not go to their city, came
            themselves to our camp and brought poultry and tunas,^ which were then in season, each
            one brought some of the food which he had in his house and gave it to us with the
            greatest good will without asking anything in return, and they always begged Cortes to
            come with them soon to their city. As we had promised to wait six days for the return of
            the Mexicans, Cortes put off the Tlaxcalans with fair speeches. When the time expired,
            according to their word, six chieftains, men of great importance, arrived from Mexico,
            and brought a rich present from the great Montezuma consisting of valuable ^ Tuna=the
            prickly pear, the fruit of the Nopal Cactus (Opuntia). 270 ANOTHER PRESENT FROM
            MONTEZtJMA. gold jewels wrought in various shapes worth three thousand pesos in gold,
            and two hundred pieces of cloth, richly worked with feathers and other patterns. When
            they offered this present the Chieftains said to Cortes that their Lord Montezuma was
            delighted to hear of our success, but that he prayed him most earnestly on no account to
            go with the people of Tlaxcala to their town, nor to place any confidence in them, that
            they wished to get him there to rob him of his gold and cloth, for they were very poor,
            and did not possess a decent cotton cloak among them, and that the knowledge that
            Montezuma looked on us as friends, and was sending us gold and jewels and cloth, would
            still more induce the Tlaxcalans to rob us. Cortes received the present with delight,
            and said that he thanked them for it and would repay their Lord Monte- zuma with good
            works, and if he should perceive that the Tlaxcalans had that in mind against which
            Montezuma had sent them to warn him, they would pay for it by having all their lives
            taken, but he felt sure they would be guilty of no such villainy, and he still meant to
            go and see what they would do. While this discussion was proceeding, many other mes-
            sengers from Tlaxcala came to tell Cortes that all the old Caciques from the Capital and
            from the whole province had arrived at our ranchos and huts, in order to see Cortes and
            all of us, and to take us to their city. When Cortes heard this he begged the Mexican
            Ambassadors to wait for three days for the reply to their prince, as he had at present
            to deliberate and decide about the past hostilities and the peace which was now offered,
            and the Ambassadors said that they would wait. What the old Caciques said to Cortes I
            will now go on to relate. THE TLAXCALAN CACIQUES VISIT THE CAMP. 2/1 CHAPTER LXXIV. How
            the old Caciques of Tlaxcala came to our Camp to beg Cortes and all of us to go with
            them at once to their city, and what happened about it. When the old Caciques from all
            Tlaxcala saw that we did not come to their city, they decided to come to us, some in
            litters, others in hammocks or carried on men's backs, and others on foot. These were
            the Caciques already men- tioned by me, named Mase Escasi, Xicotenga the elder,
            Guaxolocingo, Chichimecatecle, and Tecapaneca of Topey- anco.^ They arrived at our camp
            with a great company of chieftains, and with every sign of respect made three obeisances
            to Cortes and to all of us, and they burnt copal and touched the ground with their hands
            and kissed it, and Xicotenga the elder began to address Cortes in the following words :
            â " Malinche, Malinche,* we have sent many times to im- plore you to pardon us for
            having attacked you and to state our excuse, that we did it to defend ourselves from the
            hostility of Montezuma and his powerful forces, for we believed that you belonged to his
            party and were allied to him. If we had known what we now know, we should not only have
            gone out to receive you on the roads with supplies of food, but would even have had them
            swept for you, and we would even have gone to you to the sea where you keep your acales
            (which are the ships). Now that you have pardoned us, what I and all these Caciques have
            come to request is, that you will come at once with us to our City, where we will give
            you of all that we possess and will serve you with our persons and property. Look to it
            ^ Padre Rivera gives the names of the four Caciques of Tlaxcala as

            Malinche that you do not decide otherwise or we will leave you at once, for we fear that
            perchance these Mexicans may have told you some of the falsehoods and lies that they are
            used to tell about us. Do not believe them nor listen to them, for they are false in
            everything, and we well know that it is on their account that you have not wished to
            come to our City/* Cortes answered them with cheerful mien and said, that it was well
            known, many years before we had come to these countries, what a good people they were
            and that it was on this account that he wondered at their attacking us. He said that the
            Mexicans who were there were [merely] awaiting a reply which he was sending to their
            Lord Montezuma. He thanked them heartily for what they said about our going at once to
            their city and for the food which they were continally sending and for their other
            civilities, and he would repay them by good deeds. He said that he would already have
            set out for their City if he had had anyone to carry the tepuzques (that is the cannon).
            As soon as they heard these words the Tlaxcalans were so pleased that one could see it
            in their faces, and they said " So this is the reason why you have delayed, and never
            mentioned it." And in less than half an hour they pro- vided over five hundred Indian
            carriers. The next day early in the morning we began our march along the road to the
            Capital of Tlaxcala keeping in good formation, the artillery as well as the horsemen,
            musketeers, crossbowmen and the rest, as it was always our custom to do. The messengers
            of Montezuma had already begged Cortes that they might go with us to see how affairs
            were settled at Tlaxcala and that he would despatch them from there, and that they
            should be quartered in his own THE NAME " MALINCHE." 2/3 lodgings SO as not to receive
            any insults, for, as they said, they feared such from the Tlaxcalans. Before going on
            any further I wish to say that in all the towns we had passed through, and in others
            where they had heard of us, Cortes was called Malinche, and so I will call him Malinche
            from now henceforth in all the accounts of conversations which were held with any of the
            Indians, both in this province as well as in the City of Mexico. And I will not call him
            Cortes except in such places as it may be befitting. The reason why he was given this
            name is that Dona Marina, our interpreter, was always in his company, particularly when
            any Ambassadors arrived, and she spoke to them in the Mexican language. So that they
            gave Cortes the name of " Marina's Captain " and for short Malinche. This name was also
            attached to a certain Juan Perez de Artiaga^ (a settler at Puebla) because he always
            went with Dofla Marina and JerÃ³nimo de Aguilar in order to learn the language, and for
            this reason they called him Juan Perez Malinche, as a title of distinction to Artiago,
            as we learnt about two years later on. I have liked to call some of these things to mind
            although there is no particular reason for it, excepting that it should be understood
            from now onwards that when Malinche is mentioned it means Cortes. I also wish to say
            that from the time we entered the territory of Tlaxcala until we set out for the city,
            twenty * Written in the original Artiaga or Artiago. In the letter from the army of
            Cortes to the Emperor (Icazbalceta's Coleccion de Docu- mentos para la Historia de
            Mexico) the name is signed as what appears to be Juan Perez de Aquitiano, but the word
            Aquitiano is so imperfectly written that Icazbalceta has printed it in a different type
            as doubtful. 274 THE SPANIARDS ENTER four days had elapsed, and we entered the city on
            the 23rd September, 15 19. Now let us begin a fresh chapter and I will relate what
            happened to us there. CHAPTER LXXV. How we went to the City of Tlaxcala, and what the
            old Caciques did, about the present that they gave us, and how they brought their
            daughters and nieces, and what else happened. When the Caciques saw that our baggage was
            on the way to their city, they at once went on ahead to see that everything was ready
            for our reception and that our quarters were decked with garlands. When we arrived
            within a quarter of a league of the city, these same Caciques who had gone on ahead came
            out to receive us, and brought with them their sons and nephews and many of the leading
            inhabitants, each group of kindred and clan and party by itself. There were four parties
            in Tlaxcala, without counting that of Tecapaneca the lord of Topeyanco which made five.
            Their followers also came from all parts of the country wearing their different
            liveries, and although they were made of henequen, for there was no cotton to be
            obtained, they were very fine and beautifully embroidered and painted. Then came the
            priests from all parts of the province, and they were very numerous on account of the
            great oratories which they possess, which I have said are called Cues by the people, and
            are the places where they keep their idols and offer sacrifices. These priests carried
            braziers with live coals and incense and fumigated all of us, and some of them were
            clothed in very long garments like, fur cloaks and these were white, and they wore hoods
            over them which looked like those used by canons, as I have already said, and their hair
            was very long and tangled so that it could THE CITY OF TLAXCALA. 275 not be parted
            unless it were cut, and it was clotted with blood which oozed from their ears, which on
            that day they had cut by way of sacrifice ; and they lowered their heads as a sign of
            humility when they saw us. The nails on their fingers were very long, and we heard it
            said that these priests were very pious and led good lives. Many of the chieftains came
            near to Cortes and accom- panied him, and when we entered the town there was not space
            in the streets and on the roofs for all the Indian men and women with happy faces who
            came out to see us. They brought us about twenty cones made of sweet scented native
            roses of various colours, and gave them to Cortes and tÂ© the other soldiers whom they
            thought were Captains, especially to the horsemen. When we arrived at some fine courts
            where our quarters were, Xicotenga the elder and Mase Escasi took Cortes by the hand and
            led him into his lodging. For each one of us had been prepared a bed of matting such as
            they use, and sheets of henequen. Our friends whom we had brought from Cempoala and
            Zocatlan were lodged near to us, and Cortes asked that the messengers from the great
            Montezuma might also be given quarters close to his lodging. Although we could see
            clearly that we were in a land where they were well disposed towards us, and were quite
            at peace, we did not cease to be very much on the alert as was always our custom, and it
            appears that one captain whose duty it was to station the scouts and spies and watchmen
            said to Cortes, " It seems, sir, that the people are very peaceful and we do not need so
            many guards, nor to be so circumspect as we are accustomed to be." Cortes replied, "
            Well gentlemen, I can myself see all that you have brought to my notice, but it is a
            good custom always to be prepared, and although these may be very good people, we must
            not trust to their peacefulness, but must 2^6 CORDIALITY OF THE TLAXCALANS. be as alert
            as we should be if they intended to make war on us and we saw them coming on to the
            attack, for many captains have been defeated through overconfidence and carelessness. It
            is especially necessarj^ for us always to be on the alert as we are so few in number,
            and whether it was done in good faith or bad, we must remember that the great Montezuma
            has sent to warn us." Let us stop talking about all the arrangements and order which we
            kept up in our watches and guards, and go on to say how Xicotenga the elder and Mase
            Escasi, who were the great Caciques, were greatly annoyed with Cortes and said to him
            through our interpreters, " Malinche, either you' take us for enemies or you show signs
            in what we see you doing that you have no confidence in us or in the peace which you
            promised to us and we promised to you, and we say this to you because we see that you
            keep watch, and travelled along the road all ready for action in the same way as when
            you attacked our squadrons, an4 we believe that you, Malinche, do this on account of the
            treasons and abominations which the Mexicans have told you in secret so as to turn you
            against us. See to it that you do not believe them, for you are established here, and we
            will give you all that you desire, even ourselves and our children, and we are ready to
            die for you, so you can demand as hostages whatever you may wish." Cortes and all of us
            marvelled at the courtesy and affection with which they spoke, and Cortes answered them
            that he had always believed them, and there was no need of hostages, it was enough to
            note their good will, and that as to being on the alert, it was always our custom, and
            they must not be offended at it. He thanked them for all they had offered us, and would
            repay them for their kindness in time to come. When this conversation was over, other
            chiefs arrived with a great supply of poultry and maize bread, and tunas and other
            fruits and vegetables which the tRESENTAT10N OF GIFTS. 27; country produced, and
            supplied the camp very liberally, and during the twenty days that we stayed there there
            was always more than enough to eat We made our entry into the city, as I have said, on
            the 23rd September, 15 19. I will leave off here, and go on to say what else happened.
            CHAPTER LXXVI. How Mass was said in the presence of many of the Caciques, and about a
            present which the old Caciques brought us. Early next day Cortes ordered an Altar to be
            put up and Mass to be said, for now we had both the wine and the sacred wafers. It was
            the priest Juan Diaz who said the Mass, for the Padre de la Merced was ill with fever
            and very feeble. There were present Mase Escasi and Xicotenga the elder and other
            Caciques. When Mass was over Cortes entered his lodging with some of us soldiers who
            usually accom- panied him, and the two old Caciques, and Xicotenga said to him that they
            wished to bring him a present, and Cortes showed much affection to them, and said that
            they should bring it whenever they wished, so some mats were at once spread out and
            covered with a cloth, and they brought six or seven trifles of gold, and some stones of
            small value, and some loads of henequen cloth ; it was all very poor and not even worth
            twenty dollars and when it had been presented, those Caciques said, laughing, "Malinche,
            we know well enough that as what we have to give is so small you will not receive it
            with good grace. We have already sent to tell you that we are poor and that we own
            neither gold nor riches, and the reason of it is that these traitorous and evil Mexicans
            and Montezuma, who is now their Lord, have taken all that we once possessed, when we
            asked them 278 THE TLAXCALAN CACIQUES OFFER for peace or a truce, to prevent their
            making war on us, so do not consider the small value of the gift, but accept it with a
            good grace as the gift of friends and servants which we will be to you." Then they
            brought, separately, a large supply of food. Cortes accepted it most cheerfully, and
            said to them that he valued it more as coming from their hands with the good will with
            which it was oflFered, than he would a house full of grains of gold brought by others,
            and it was in this spirit that he accepted it, and he displayed much afTection towards
            them. It appears that it had been arranged among all the Caciques to give us from among
            their daughters and nieces the most beautiful of the maidens who were ready for
            marriage, and Xicotenga the elder said " Malinche, so that you may know more clearly our
            good will towards ycLU and our desire to content you in everything, we wish to give you
            our daughters, to be your wives, so that you may have children by them, for we wish to
            consider you as brothers as you are so good and valiant. I have a very beautiful
            daughter who has not been married, and I wish to give her to you," so also Mase Escasi
            and all the other Caciques said that they would bring their daughters, and that we
            should accept them as wives, and they made many other speeches and promises. Throughout
            the day Mase Escasi and Xicotenga the elder never left Cortes* im- mediate
            neighbourhood. As Xicotenga the elder was blind from old age, he felt Cortes all over
            his head and face and beard and over all his body. Cortes replied to them that, as to
            the gift of the women, he and all of us were very grateful and would repay them with
            good deeds as time went on. The Padre de la Merced was present and Cortes said to him "
            Senor Padre, it seems to me that this would be a good time to make an attempt to induce
            these Caciques to give up their THEIR DAUGHTERS TO THE SPANIARDS. 279 Idols and their
            sacrifices, for they will do anything we tell them to do on account of the great fear
            they have of the Mexicans." The friar replied, " Sir, that is true, but let us leave the
            matter until they bring their daughters and then there will be material to work upon,
            and your honour can say that you do not wish to accept them until they give up
            sacrifices â if that succeeds, good, if not we shall do our duty." So thus the matter
            rested until next day, and what was done I will go on to relate. CHAPTER LXXVII. How
            they brought their daughters to present to Cortes and to all of us, and what was done
            about it. The next day the same old Caciques came and brought with them five beautiful
            Indian maidens, and for Indians they were very good looking and well adorned, and each
            of the Indian maidens brought another Indian girl as her servant, and all were the
            daughters of Caciques, and Xicotenga said to Cortes, " Malinche, this is my daughter who
            has never been married and is a maiden, take her for your own," and he gave her to him
            by the hand, " and let the others be given to the captains." Cortes expressed his
            thanks, and with every appearance of gratification said that he accepted them and took
            them as our own, but that for the present they should remain in the care of their
            parents. The Chiefs asked him why he would not take them now, and Cortes replied that he
            wished first to do the will of God our Lord, whom we believed in and wor- shipped, and
            that for which our Lord the King had sent us, which was to induce them to do away with
            their Idols, and no longer to kill and sacrifice human beings, and the other infamies
            they were wont to practise, and to lead them to 28o CORTES EXPLAINS CHRISTIANITY.
            believe in that which we believed, that is in one true God, and he told them much more
            touching our holy faith, and in truth he expressed it very well, for Dona Marina and
            Aguilar, our interpreters, were already so expert at it that they explained it very
            clearly. He showed the Caciques an image of our Lady, with her precious Infant in her
            arms, and explained to them how that image was in the likeness of our Lady, who is
            called Santa Maria, who dwells in the high heavens and is the mother of our Lord, who is
            that Child Jesus whom she holds in her arms, whom she conceived by the grace of the Holy
            Spirit, being a virgin before His birth, and remaining a Virgin during His birth, and
            after His birth, and how that Great Lady prays for us to her precious Son who is our God
            and Lord, and he told them many other things which it was fitting to say about our holy
            faith. He also told them that if they wished to be our brothers and to have true
            friendship with us, so that we should willingly accept their daughters and take them, as
            they said, for our wives, that they should at once give up their evil Idols and believe
            in and worship our Lord God, who is He in whom we believe and whom we worship, and they
            would see how well things would go with them, for in addition to having good health and
            good seasons, other things would prosper with them, and when they died their souls would
            go to Heaven to enjoy glory everlasting ; but that if they went on making sacrifices as
            they were accustomed to do to their Idols, which were devils, they would be led to Hell
            where they would burn for ever in live flames. And as in other discourses he had already
            said much about the giving up of their Idols, he said nothing more now and what they
            replied to it all is as follows : â *' Malinche, we have already understood from you
            before now, and we thoroughly believe that this God of yours and this great Lady are
            very good, but look you, you have only THE TLAXCALAN REPLY. 28 1 just come to our homes,
            as time goes on we shall under- stand your beliefs much more clearly, and see what they
            are, and will do what is right. But how can you ask us to give up our Teules which for
            many years our ancestors have held to be gods and have made sacrifices to them and have
            worshipped them ? Even if we, who are old men, might wish to do it to please you, what
            would our priests say, and all our neighbours, and the youths and children throughout
            the province? They would rise against us, especially as the priests have already
            consulted the greatest of our Teules, and he told them not to forget the sacrifice of
            men and all the rites they were used to practise, other- wise the gods would destroy the
            whole province with famine, pestilence and war." Thus they spoke and gave as their
            answer that we should not trouble to talk to them on that subject again for they were
            not going to leave off making sacrifices even if they were killed for it. When we heard
            that reply which they gave so honestly and without fear, the Padre de la Merced, who was
            a wise man, and a theologian, said, ** Sir, do not attempt to press them further on this
            subject, for it is not just to make them Christians by force, and I would not wish that
            you should do what we did in Cempoala, that is, destroy their Idols, until they have
            some knowledge of our Holy Faith. What good is it to take away now their Idols from one
            oratory or cue, if they carry them at once to another. It would be better that they
            should gradually feel the weight of our admonitions which are good and holy, so that
            later on they may realize the good advice which we are giving them." Furthermore three
            gentlemen, namely, Juan Velasquez de Leon and Francisco de Lugo, spoke to Cortes and
            said " The Padre is right in what he says, you have fulfilled your duty with what you
            have done, and do not touch again on this matter when speaking to these Caciques," and
            so the subject dropped. What we induced 282 TLAXCALAN DAMSELS ARE ALLOTTED the Caciques
            to do, by entreaty, was at once to clear out one of the cues, which was close by and had
            been recently built, and after removing the Idols, to clean it and white- wash it so
            that we could place a cross in it and the image of Our Lady, and this they promptly did.
            Then Mass was said there and the Cacicas were baptized. The daughter of the blind
            Xicotenga was given the name of Dona Luisa, and Cortes took her by the hand and gave her
            to Pedro de Alvarado, and said to Xicotenga that he to whom he gave her was his brother
            and his Captain, and that he should be pleased at it as she would be well treated by
            him, and Xicotenga was contented that it should be so. The daughter or niece of Mase
            Escasi was named Dona Elvira and she was very beautiful and it seems to me that she was
            given to Juan Velasquez de Leon. The others were given baptismal names, always with the
            title of nobility (dona), and Cortes gave them to Gonzalo de Sandoval, and Cristobal de
            Olid and Alonzo de Avila. When this had been done Cortes told them the reason why he put
            up two crosses, and that it was because their Idols were afraid of them, and that
            wherever we were encamped or wherever we slept they were placed in the roads ; and at
            all this they were quite content. Before I go on any further I wish to say about the
            Cacica the daughter of Xicotenga, who was named Doha Luisa and was given to Pedro de
            Alvarado, that when they gave her to him all the greater part of Tlascala paid reverence
            to her, and gave her presents, and looked on her as their mistress, and Pedro de
            Alvarado who was then a bachelor, had a son by her named Don Pedro, and a daughter named
            Dona Leonor who is now the wife of Don Francisco de la Cueva, a nobleman, and a cousin
            of the Duke of Alberquerque, who had by her four or five sons, very good gentlemen, and
            that lady Dona Leonor, is so very excellent a lady, as might be expected, being TO THE
            SPANISH CAPTAINS. 283 the daughter of such a father, who was a commendador of [The Order
            of] Santiago, Adelantado and Governor of Guatemala, and the same who went to Peru with a
            great fleet, and through his relation to Xicotenga was a great Lord of Tlaxcala. I must
            leave these stories and return to Cortes who questioned those Caciques and informed
            himself more completely about the affairs of Mexico. What they said about it is what I
            shall go on to relate. CHAPTER LXXVIII. How Cortes questioned Mase Escasi and Xicotenga
            about things in Mexico, and what account they gave of them. Cortes then took those
            Caciques aside and questioned them very fully about Mexican affairs. Xicotenga, as he
            was the best informed and a great chieftain, took the lead in talking, and from time to
            time he was helped by Mase Escasi who was also a great chief. He said that Montezuma had
            such great strength in warriors that when he wished to capture a great city or make a
            raid on a province, he could place a hundred and fifty thousand men in the field, and
            this they knew well from the experience of the wars and hostilities they had had with
            them for more than a hundred years past. Cortes asked them how it was that with so many
            warriors as they said came down on them they had never been entirely conquered. They
            answered that although the Mexicans sometimes defeated them and killed them, and carried
            off" many of their vassals for sacrifice, many of the enemy were also left dead on the
            field and others were made prisoners, and that they never could come so secretly that
            they did not get some warning, and that when they knew of their approach they mustered
            all 284 THE TLAXCALAN CACIQtJES their forces and with the help of the people of
            Huexotzingo they defended themselves and made counter attacks. That as all the provinces
            which had been raided by Montezuma and placed under his rule were ill disposed towards
            the Mexicans, and that as their inhabitants were carried off by force to the wars, they
            did not fight with good will ; indeed, it was from these very men that they received
            warnings, and for this reason they had defended their country to the best of their
            ability. The place from which the most continuous trouble came to them was a very great
            city a day's march distant, which is called Cholula, whose inhabitants are most
            treacherous. It was there that Montezuma secretly mustered his com- panies and, as it
            was near by, they made their raids by night. Moreover, Mase Escasi said that Montezuma
            kept garrisons of many warriors stationed in all the provinces in addition to the great
            force he could bring from the city, and that all the provinces paid tribute of gold and
            silver, feathers, stones, cloth and cotton, and Indian men and women for sacrifice and
            others for servants, that he [Montezuma] was such a great prince that he possessed
            everything he could desire, that the houses where he dwelt were full of riches and
            [precious] stones and chalchihuites which he had robbed and taken by force from those
            who would not give them willingly, and that all the wealth of the country was in his
            hands. Then they told us about the great staflF of servants in his house, and the story
            would never cease were I to attempt to describe it all here, and of the many women he
            possessed, and how he married off some of them ; in fact they gave us an account of
            everything. Then they spoke of the great fortifications of the city, and what the lake
            was like, and the depth of water, and about the causeways that gave access to the city,
            and the wooden bridges in each causeway, and how one can go in GIVE A DESCRIPTION OF
            MEXICO. 285 and out [by water] through the opening that there is in each bridge, and how
            when the bridges are raised one can be cut off between bridge and bridge and not be able
            to reach the city. How the greater part of the city was built in the lake, and that one
            could not pass from house to house except by draw-bridges and canoes which they had
            ready. That all the houses were flat-roofed and all the roofs were provided with
            parapets so that they could fight from them. They also told us about the way the city
            was provided with fresh water from a spring called Chapultepec distant about half a
            league fronj the city, and how the water enters by an aqueduct and reaches a place
            whence they can carry it in canoes to sell it in the streets. Then they told us about
            the arms that were used, such as two pronged javelins which they hurl with throwing
            sticks,* and will go through any sort of armour, and that there are many good archers,
            and others with lances with flint edges which have a fathom of cutting edge, so cleverly
            made that they cut better than knives, and they have shields, and cotton armour, and
            there are many slingers who sling rounded stones, and others with very good and long
            lances and stone edged two handed swords. They brought us pictures of the battles they
            had fought with the Mexicans painted on large henequen cloths, showing their manner of
            fighting. As our captain and all of us had already heard about all that these Caciques
            were telling us, we changed the subject, and started them on another more profound,
            which was, how was it that they came to inhabit that land, and from what direction had
            they come ? and how was it that they differed so much from and were so hostile to the
            Mexicans, seeing that their countries were so close to one another. * Atlatls, or spear

            in times past there had lived among them men and women of giant size with huge bones,
            and because they were very bad people of evil manners that they had fought with them and
            killed them, and those of them who remained died off. So that we could see how huge and
            tall these people had been they brought us a leg bone of one of them which was very
            thick and the height of a man of ordinary stature, and that was the bone from the hip to
            the knee. I measured myself against it and it was as tall as I am although I am of fair
            size. They brought other pieces of bones like the first, but they were already eaten
            away and destroyed by the soil. We were all amazed at seeing those bones and felt sure
            that there must have been giants in this country, and our Captain Cortes said to us that
            it would be well to send that great bone to Castille so that His Majesty might see it,
            so we sent it with the first of our agents who went there. These Caciques also told us
            that they had learnt from their forefathers that one of their Idols, to which they paid
            the greatest devotion, had told them that men would come from distant lands in the
            direction of the rising sun to subjugate them and govern them, and that if we were those
            men, they were rejoiced at it, as we were so good and brave, and that when they made
            peace with us they had borne in mind what their Idols had said, and for this reason they
            had given us their daughters so as to obtain relations who would defend them against the
            Mexicans. When they had finished their discourse we were all astounded and said, can
            they possibly have spoken the truth ? Then our Captain Cortes replied to them and said
            that certainly we came from the direction of the sunrise, and that our Lord the King had
            sent us for this very purpose that we should become as brothers to them ; for series II.

            ORDÃS ASCENDS POPOCATEPETL. 287 he had heard of them, and that he prayed God to give us
            grace, so that by our hands and our intercession they would be saved, and we all said
            Amen. , The gentlemen who read this will be weary of hearing the discussions and
            conversations between us and the Tlaxcalans and the Tlaxcalans and us, so I would wish
            to finish them, but I feel bound to dwell on one other thing which they discussed with
            us, and that is the volcano near Huexotzingo which at the time we were in Tlaxcala was
            throwing out much fire, much more than usual. Our Captain Cortes and all of us were
            greatly astonished as we had never seen such a thing before. One of our Captains named
            Diego de OrdÃ¡s was very anxious to go and see what sort of a thing it was, and asked
            leave of the general to ascend the mountain, and leave was given,^ and he even expressly
            ordered him to do it. He took with him two of our soldiers and certain Indian chiefs
            from Huexot- zingo, and the chiefs that he took with him frightened him by saying that
            when one was half way up Popocatepetl, for so the volcano is called, one could not
            endure the shaking of the ground and the flames and stones and ashes which were thrown
            out of the mountain, and that they would not dare to ascend further than where stood the
            cues of the Idols which are called the Teules of Popo- catepetl. Nevertheless Diego de
            OrdÃ¡s and his two companions went on up until they reached the summit, and the Indians
            who had accompanied them remained below and did not dare to make the ascent. It appears
            from what OrdÃ¡s and the two soldiers said afterwards, that, as they ascended, the
            volcano began to throw out great tongues of flame, and half burnt stones of little
            weight and a great quantity of ashes, and that the whole of the Â» This account of the
            ascent of Popocatepetl appears to be given in the wrong place by Bernal Diaz : it
            probably took place when the Spaniards left Cholula. See Cortes' Second Letter. 288
            ORDAS ascends POPOCATEPETL. mountain range where the volcano stands was shaken, and that
            they stopped still without taking a step in advance for more than an hour, when they
            thought that the outburst had passed and not so much smoke and ashes were bein^ thrown
            out ; then they climbed up to the mouth which was very wide and round, and opened to the
            width of a quarter of a league. From this summit could be seen the great city of Mexico,
            and the whole of the lake, and all the towns which were built in it. This volcano is
            distant twelve or thirteen leagues from Mexico. OrdÃ¡s was delighted and astonished at
            the sight of Mexico and its cities and after having had a good look at the view he
            returned to Tlaxcala with his companions, and the Indians of Huexotzingo and of Tlaxcala
            looked on it as a deed of great daring. When he told his story to Captain Cortes and all
            of us, we were greatly astonished at it, for at that time we had not seen nor heard of
            such things as we have to-day, when we know all about it, and many Spaniards and even
            some Franciscan friars have made the ascent to the crater. When Diego de OrdÃ¡s went to
            Castille he asked the King for it [the mountain] as his [coat of] arms and his nephew
            who lives at Puebla, now bears them. Since we have been settled in this land we have
            never known the volcano to throw out so much fire or make such a noise as it did when we
            first arrived, and it has even remained some years without throwing out any fire, up to
            the year 1539 when it threw up great flames and stones and ashes. Let us cease telling
            about the volcano, for now that we know what sort of a thing it is, and have seen other
            i volcanoes such as those of Nicaragua and Guatemala, one 1 might have been silent about
            those of Huexotzingo, and ' left them out of the story. I must tell how in this town of
            Tlaxcala we found I I PRISONERS ATTEND IN CAGES. 289 wooden houses furnished with
            gratings, full of Indian men and women imprisoned in them, being fed up until they were
            fat enough to be sacrificed and eaten. These prisons we broke open and destroyed, and
            set free the prisoners who were in them, and these poor Indians did not dare to go in
            any direction, only to stay there with us and thus escape with their lives. From now on,
            in all the towns that we entered, the first thing our Captain ordered us to do was to
            break open these prisons and set free the prisoners. These prisons are common throughout
            the land and when Cortes and all of us saw such great cruelty, he showed that he was
            very angry with the Caciques of Tlaxcala, and quarrelled with them very angrily about
            it, and they promised that from that time forth they would not kill and eat any more
            Indians in that way. I said [to myself] of what benefit were all those promises, for as
            soon as we turned our heads they would commit the same cruelties. Let us leave this
            subject, and I will relate how we arranged to go to Mexico. CHAPTER LXXIX. How our
            Captain Hernando Cortes decided that all of us Captains and soldiers should go to
            Mexico, and what happened about it. When our Captain remembered that we had already been
            resting in Tlaxcala for seventeen days, and that we had heard so much said about the
            great wealth of Montezuma and his flourishing city, he arranged to take counsel with all
            those among our captains and soldiers whom he could depend on as wishing to advance, and
            it was decided that our departure should take place without delay, but there was a good
            deal of dissent expressed in camp about this U 290 CORTES DECIDES TO ADVANCE decision,
            for some soldiers said that it was a very rash thing to go and enter into such a strong
            city, as we were so few in number, and they spoke of the very great strength of
            Montezuma. Our Captain Cortes replied that there was now no other course open to us, for
            we had constantly asserted and proclaimed that we were going to see Monte- zuma, so that
            other counsels were useless. His opponents seeing with what determination Cortes
            expressed himself, and knowing that many of us soldiers were ready to help him by
            crying: "Forward and good luck to us," dropped all further opposition. The men opposed
            [to Cortes] in this discussion were those who owned pro- perty in Cuba. I and other poor
            soldiers had always dedicated our souls to God who created them, and our bodies to
            wounds and hardships, and even to death in the service of Our Lord God and of His
            Majesty. When Xicotenga and Mase Escaci, the lords of Tlaxcala, saw that we were
            determined to go to Mexico, their spirits were weighed down, and they were constantly
            with Cortes advising him not to enter on such an undertaking, and not to trust Montezuma
            neither in great things nor in small, nor any other Mexican, and not to put faith in the
            great show of reverence he had made, nor in his words, however humble and courteous they
            might be, nor even in all the presents that had been sent to him, nor in any of his
            promises, for all was the work of traitors, who would turn on him and take back in an
            hour all that they had given, and that he must be on his guard against them both by day
            and by night, for they felt sure that when we were most off our guard they would attack
            us. They advised us when we fought with them [the Mexicans] to leave none alive that we
            were able to kill, neither the youths, so that they should never be able to carry arms,
            nor the old, lest they should give counsel ; and they gave us much other advice. BY WAV
            OF CHOLULA. 29 1 Our captain said to them that he thanked the Caciques for their good
            counsel, and he showed them much affection, and made them many promises, and he gave as
            presents to JCicotenga the elder, and to Mase Escasi and most of the other Caciques a
            great part of the fine cloth which Monte- zuma had presented, and told them that it
            would be a good thing to make peace between them and the Mexicans, so that they should
            become friends and they could then obtain salt and cotton and other merchandise.
            Xicotenga replied that peace was useless, and that enmity was deeply rooted in their
            hearts, for such were the Mexicans that, under cover of peace, they would only be guilty
            of greater treachery, for they never told the truth in anything that they promised, and
            that he was not to trouble about saying more on the subject, and that they could only
            again im- plore us to take care not to fall into the hands of such bad people. We went
            on to talk about the road which we should take to reach Mexico, for the ambassadors from
            Montezuma, who remained with us and were to be our guides, said that the most level and
            the best road was by the city of Cholula, where the people were vassals of Montezuma and
            there we should receive proper attention. To all of us this appeared to be good advice,
            that we should go by that city. When however the Caciques of Tlaxcala heard that we
            wished to go by a road which the Mexicans were choosing for us, they became very
            sorrowful, and begged us in any case to go by Huexotzingo, where the people were their
            relations and our friends, and not by way of Cholula, for in Cholula Montezuma always
            kept his double dealings concealed. For all that they talked and advised us not to enter
            into that city, our Captain, (in accordance with our counsel which had been well talked
            over,) still determined to go by Cholula, on the one hand, because all agreed that it
            was a large town, and well furnished with towers, and fine and U 2 292 MESSENGERS SENT
            TO CHOLULA. tall cues, and situated on a beautiful plainâ and indeed at that time it
            looked from a distance like our city of Valla- dolid in Old Castile, â and on the other
            hand, because it was almost surrounded by other considerable towns and could provide
            ample supplies, and our friends of Tlaxcala were near at hand. We intended to stay there
            until we could decide how to get to Mexico without having to fight for it, for the great
            power of the Mexicans was a thing to be feared, and unless God our Lord, by His Divine
            mercy which always helped us and gave us strength, should first of all so provide, we
            could not enter Mexico in any other manner. After much discussion it was settled that we
            should take the road by Cholula, and Cortes at once sent messengers to ask the people of
            Cholula how it happened that being so near to us they had not come to visit us, and pay
            that respect which was due to us as the messengers of so great a prince as the King who
            had sent us to the country to tell them of their salvation. He then requested all the
            Caciques and priests of that city to come and see us and give their fealty to our Lord
            and King, and if they did not come he would look upon them as ill disposed towards us.
            While he was giving this' message and saying other things about which it seemed right
            that they should be informed, some- one came to tell Cortes that the great Montezuma had
            sent four Ambassadors with presents of gold, (for so far as we have seen they never send
            a message without a present of gold and cloth, as it is looked on as an affront to send
            a message without sending a present with it,) and what these messengers said I will go
            on to relate. ARRIVAL OF MONTEZUMA^S AMBASSADORS. 293 CHAPTER LXXX. How the great
            Montezuma sent four Chieftains of great importance with a present of gold and cloth, and
            what they said to our Captain. While Cortes was talking to us all and to the Caciques of
            Tlaxcala about our departure and about warfare, they came to tell him that four
            Ambassadors, all four chieftains who were bringing presents, had arrived in the town.
            Cortes ordered them to be called, and when they came before him they paid the greatest
            reverence to him and to all of us soldiers who were there with him, and presented their
            gift of rich jewels of gold of many sorts of workman- ship, well worth two thousand
            dollars, and ten loads of cloth beautifully embroidered with feathers. Cortes received
            them most graciously, and the Am- bassadors said, on behalf of their Lord Montezuma,
            that he greatly wondered that we should stay so many days among a people who were so
            poor and so ill bred, who were so wicked, and such traitors and thieves that they were
            not fit even to be slaves, and that when either by day or by night we were most off our
            guard they would kill us in order to rob us. That he begged us to come at once to his
            city, and he would give us of all that he possessed, although it would not be as much as
            we deserved or he would like to give, and that although all the supplies had to be
            carried into the city, he would provide for us as well as he was able. Montezuma did
            this so as to get us out of Tlaxcala, for he knew of the friendship we had made, which I
            have recorded in the chapter which treats of that subject, and how, to perfect it, they
            [the Tlaxcalans] had given their daughters to Malinche, and the Mexicans fully
            understood that our confederation could bring no good 294 ANOTHER EMBASSY to them. It
            was for this reason that they primed us with gold and presents, so as to induce us to go
            to their country or at least to get us out of Tlaxcala. I must add regarding the
            ambassadors, that the people of Tlaxcala knew them well, and told our Captain that all
            of them were lords over towns and vassals, and men whom Montezuma employed to conduct
            affairs of the greatest importance. Cortes thanked the messengers with many caressing
            expressions and signs of affection, and gave as his answer that he would go very soon to
            see their Lord Montezuma, and he begged them to remain a few days with us. At that time
            Cortes decided that two of our Captains, men especially chosen, should go and see and
            speak to the great Montezuma, and see the great city of Mexico and its great armies and
            fortresses, and Pedro de Alvarado and Bcrnaldino VÃ¡squez de TÃ¡pia had already set out on
            the journey, accompanied by some of the ambassadors of the great Montezuma who were used
            to being with us, and the four ambassadors who had brought the present remained with us
            as hostages. As at that time Cortes had sent those gentlemen trusting to good luck, we
            dissuaded him from it, saying that as he was sending them to Mexico merely to see the
            city^ and its strength, we did not think it well advised, and that he should send and
            tell them not to pro- ceed any further, so he wrote to them telling them to return at
            once. Besides this Bernaldino VÃ¡squez de TÃ¡pia had already fallen ill of fever on the r
            )ad, and as soon as they saw the letters they returned. The ambassadors with whom they
            were travelling gave an account of their doings to Montezuma, and he asked them what
            sort of faces and general appearance had these two Teules who were coming to Mexico, and
            whether they ^ See note at end of chapter. FROM MONTEZUMA. 295 were Captains, and it
            seems that they replied that Pedro de Alvarado was of very perfect grace both in face
            and person, that he looked like the Sun, and that he was a Captain, and in addition to
            this they brought with them a picture of him with his face "^ery naturally portrayed,
            and from that time forth they gave him the name of Tonatio, which means the Sun or the
            child of the Sun, and so they called him ever after. Of Bernaldino VÃ¡squez de TÃ¡pia,
            they said that he was a robust man, and of a very pleasant disposition, and that he also
            was a captain, and Montezuma was much disappointed that they had turned back again.
            Those ambassadors had reason for the description given to the Lord Montezuma both as to
            features and general appearance, for Pedro de Alvarado was very well made and active,
            and of good features and bearing, and both in appearance and in speech and in everything
            else he was so pleasing that he seemed always to be smiling. Bernaldino VÃ¡squez de TÃ¡pia
            was somewhat sturdy, but he had a good presence ; when they returned to our camp, we
            joked with them and told them that it was not a very successful mission that Cortes had
            sent them on. Let us leave this subject, for it does not bear much on our story, and I
            will tell about the messengers whom Cortes sent to Cholula and the reply that they
            brought Note. â In the original MS. the following passage is scratched out : â¢*To see
            the great city of Mexico and its great army and fortresses, and it seems to me that they
            were Pedro de Alvarado and Bernaldino VÃ¡squez de TÃ¡pia, a^d four of the ambassadors who
            brought the present remained as hostages, and the others went with them. As at that time
            I was very badly wounded and was fully occupied in trying to get well I did not know
            everything that was going on. I have already written to Mexico to three of my friends
            who were present throughout the conquest to send me an account [of what took place], so
            that the matter should not be in doubt. If I do not repeat here all that they say on the
            subject, I submit myself to the conquerors for correction, but I know without any doubt
            that Bernaldino VÃ¡squez de TÃ¡pia, when on the road had a bad fever and remained at a
            town 296 NEGOTIATIONS WITH called â¦ * * * , and that Pedro de Alvarado went towards
            Mexico and turned back on the road, and that it was then that those four chieftains whom
            he took with him gave him the name of Tonatio, which in the Mexican language means Sun,
            and so they called him from that time on. They gave him that name because he was of fine
            presence and active and of good features and bearing, so that both in face and in speech
            and in everything else he was so pleasing, that he appeared always to be smiling. I also
            know what I have stated that these said Captains never arrived at Mexico, for when they
            set out from our camp all the soldiers were distressed at their going, and we said to
            our Captain, * why send two such excellent men when there is a chance that they may be
            killed ' ; so Cortes wrote to them at once to return. I am not quite sure about it, I
            leave it to the judgment of those who were present. Others of the Conquistadores have
            told me that as Bemaldino VÃ¡squez de TÃ¡pia was ill in one of the towns, that the
            messengers informed Montezuma of the fact, and he sent to say that neither he nor Pedro
            de Alvarado should proceed any further, for if they should go to Mexico there would not
            be a thing that would not be clearly known to all the soldiers.'' CHAPTER LXXXI. How the
            people of Cholula sent four Indians of little consequence to make their excuses for not
            having come to TIaxcala, and what happened about it. I HAVE already said in the last
            chapter how our Captain sent messengers to Cholula to tell the Caciques of that City to
            come and see us at TIaxcala. When the Caciques understood what Cortes ordered them to
            do, they thought that it would be sufficient to send four unimportant Indians to make
            their excuses, and to say that because they were ill they had not come, and they brought
            neither food nor anything else, but merely stated that curt reply. The Caciques of
            TIaxcala were present when these messengers arrived, and they said to our Captain, that
            the people of Cholula had sent those Indians to make a mock of him THE CACIQUES OF
            CIlOLlJA. 297 and of all of us, for they were only commoners of no standing; so Cortes
            at once sent them back with four other Cempoala Indians to tell the people of Cholula
            that they must send some chieftains, and as the distance w^ only five leagues that they
            must arrive within three days, otherwise he should look on them as rebels ; that when
            they came he wished to tell them some things necessary for the salvation of their souls
            and for the cleanliness of their well being, and to receive them as friends and brothers
            as he had received their neighbours the people of Tlaxcala, and that if they decided
            otherwise and did not wish for our friendship that we should take measures which would
            displease them and anger them. When the Caciques of Cholula had listened to that embassy
            they answered that they were not coming to Tlaxcala, for the Tlaxcalans were their
            enemies, and they knew that they [the Tlaxcalans] had said many evil things about them
            and about their Lord Montezuma ; that it was for us to come to their city and to leave
            the confines of Tlaxcala, and that then if they did not do what they ought to do we
            could treat them as such as we had sent to say they were. When our Captain saw that the
            excuse that they made was a just one we resolved to go to Cholula, and as soon as the
            Caciques of Tlaxcala perceived that we were deter- mined to go there, they said to
            Cortes, " So you wish to trust to the Mexicans and not to us who are your friends, we
            have already told you many times that you must beware of the people of Cholula and of
            the power of Mexico, and so that you can receive all the support possible from us, we
            have got ready ten thousand warriors to accompany you." Cortes thanked them very
            heartily for this, but after consultation with all of us it was agreed that it would not
            be advisable to take so many warriors to a country in which we were seeking friends, and
            that it 29S PREPARATIONS FOR THE MARCH. would be better to take only one thousand, and
            this num- ber we asked of the Tlaxcalans and said that the rest should remain in their
            houses. Let us leave this discussion and I will tell about our march. </p>
