      <body>
         <p> My edition (of 1810) is a dumpy Uttle book, in very small type, and quite a crowd of
            publishers took part in the venture. The older editions are difficult to procure if your
            pockets are not stuffed with pieces-of-eight. You do not often find even this volume,
            but " when found make a note of ", and you have a reply to Canon Kingsley. A charitable
            old Scotch lady, who heard our ghostly foe evil spoken of, remarked that " If we were
            all as diligent and conscientious as the Devil, it would be better for us ". Now, the
            buccaneers were certainly models of diligence and con- scientiousness in their own
            industry, which was to torture people till they gave up their goods, and then to run
            them through the body, and spend the spoils over drink and dice. Except Dampier, who was
            a clever man, but a poor buccaneer (Mr Clark Russell has written his life), they were
            the most hideously ruthless miscreants that ever disgraced the earth and the sea. But
            their courage and endurance were no less notable than their greed and cruelty, so that a
            moral can be squeezed even out of these abandoned miscreants. The soldiers and sailors
            who made their way within gunshot of Khartoum, overcoming thirst, hunger, heat, the
            desert, and the gallant children of the desert, did not fight, march, and suffer more
            bravely than the scoundrels who sacked Maracaibo and burned Panama. Their good qualities
            were no less astounding and exemplary than their almost incredible wickedness. They did
            not lie about in hammocks .much, listening to the landward wind among the woods — the
            true buccaneers. To tell the truth, most of them had no particular cause to love the
            human species. They were often Europeans who had been sold into slavery on the West
            Indian plantations, where they learned lessons of cruelty by suffering it. Thus Mr
            Joseph Esquemel- ing, our historian, was beaten, tortured, and nearly starved to death
            in Tortuga, " so I determined, not knowing how to get any living, to enter into the
            order of the pirates or robbers of the sea ". The poor Indians of the isles, much pitied
            by Kingsley's buccaneer, had a habit of sticking their prisoners all over with thorns,
            wrapped in oily cotton, whereto they ADVENTURES OF BUCCANEERS xv then set fire. " These
            cruelties many Christians have seen while they Uved among these barbarians". Mr
            Esquemeling was to see, and inflict, plenty of this kind of torment, which was not out
            of the way nor unusual. One planter alone had killed over a hundred of his servants — "
            the English did the same with theirs ". A buccaneer voyage began in stealing a ship,
            collecting desperadoes, and torturing the local herdsmen till they gave up their
            masters' flocks, which were salted as provisions. Articles of service were then drawn
            up, on the principle *' no prey, no pay ". The spoils, when taken, were loyally divided
            as a rule, though Captain Morgan, of Wales, made no more scruple about robbing his crew
            than about barbecuing a Spanish priest. " They are very civil and charitable to each
            other, so that if any one wants what another has, with great wilhngness they give it to
            one another ". In other matters they did not in the least resemble the early Christians.
            A fellow nicknamed The Portuguese may be taken as our first example of their commendable
            qualities. With a small ship of four guns he had taken a great one of twenty guns, with
            70,000 pieces-of -eight. ... He himself, however, was presently captured by a larger
            vessel, and imprisoned on board. Being carelessly watched, he escaped on two earthen
            jars (for he could not swim), reached the woods in Campechy, and walked for a hundred
            and twenty miles through the bush. His only food was a few shell-fish, and by way of a
            knife he had a large nail, which he whetted to an edge on a stone. Having made a kind of
            raft, he struck a river, and paddled to Golpho Triste, where he found congenial pirates.
            With twenty of these, and a boat, he returned to Campechy, where he had been a prisoner,
            and actually captured the large ship in which he had lain captive I Bad luck pursued
            him, however : his prize was lost in a storm*; he reached Jamaica in a canoe, and never
            afterwards was concerned as leader in any affair of distinction. Not even Odysseus had
            more resource, nor was more long-enduring ; but Fortune was The Portuguese's foe.
            Braziliano, another <name>Buccaneer</name>, served as a pirate before the mast, and " was beloved and
            respected by all ". Being raised to command, he took a plate ship ; but this success was
            of indifferent service to his otherwise amiable character. xvi ADVENTURES OF BUCCANEERS
            " He would often appear foolish and brutish when in drink ", and has been known to roast
            Spaniards ahve on wooden spits " for not showing him hog yards where he might steal
            swine ". One can hardly suppose that Kingsley would have regretted this buccaneer, even
            if he had been the last, which unluckily he was not. His habit of sitting in the street
            beside a barrel of beer, and shooting all passers-by who would not drink with him,
            provoked remark, and was an act detestable to all friends of temperance principles.
            Francois L'Olonnois, from Southern France, had been kidnapped, and sold as a slave in
            the Caribbee Islands. Recovering his freedom, he plundered the Spanish, says my
            buccaneer author, " till his unfortunate death ". With two canoes he captured a ship
            which had been sent after him, carrying ten guns and a hangman for his express benefit.
            This hangman, much to the fellow's chagrin, L'Olonnois put to death like the rest of his
            prisoners. His great achievements were in the Gulf of Venezuela or Bay of Maracaibo. The
            gulf is a strong place ; the mouth, no wider than a gun-shot, is guarded by two islands.
            Far up the inlet is Maracaibo, a town of three thousand people, fortified and surrounded
            by woods. Yet farther up is the town of Gibraltar. To attack these was a desperate
            enterprise ; but L'Olonnois stole past the forts, and frightened the townsfolk into the
            woods. As a rule the Spaniards made the poorest resistance ; there were examples of
            courage, but none of conduct. With strong forts, heavy guns, many men, provisions, and
            ammunition, they quailed before the desperate valour of the pirates. The towns were
            sacked, the fugitives hunted out in the woods, and the most abominable tortures were
            applied to make them betray their friends and reveal their treasures. When they were
            silent, or had no treasures to declare, they were hacked, twisted, burned, and starved
            to death. Such were the manners of L'Olonnois ; and Captain Morgan, of Wales, was even
            more ruthless. Gibraltar was well fortified and strengthened after Mara- caibo fell ;
            new batteries were raised, the way through the woods was barricaded, and no fewer than
            eight hundred men were under arms to resist a small pirate force, exhausted by debauch,
            and having its retreat cut off by the forts at the mouth of the great salt-water loch.
            But L'Olonnois did not ADVENTURES OF BUCCANEERS xvii blench : he told the men that
            audacity was their one hope, also that he would pistol the first who gave ground. The
            men cheered enthusiastically, and a party of three hundred and fifty landed. The
            barricaded way they could not force, and in a newly cut path they met a strong battery
            which fired grape. But L'Olonnois was invincible. He tried that old trick which rarely
            fails, a sham retreat, and this lured the Spaniards from their earthwork on the path.
            The pirates then turned, sword in hand, slew two hundred of the enemy, and captured
            eight guns. The town yielded, the people fled to the woods, and then began the wonted
            sport of torturing the prisoners. Maracaibo they ransomed afresh, obtained a pilot,
            passed the forts with ease, and returned after sacking a small province. On a dividend
            being declared, they parted 260,000 pieces-of-eight among the band, and spent the
            pillage in a revel of three weeks. L'Olonnois " got great repute " by this conduct, but
            I rejoice to add that in a raid on Nicaragua he " miserably perished ", and met what Mr
            Esquemeling calls " his un- fortunate death ". For L'Olonnois was really an ungentle-
            manly character. He would hack a Spaniard to pieces, tear out his heart, and " gnaw it
            with his teeth like a ravenous wolf, saying to the rest ' I will serve you all alike if
            you show me not another way ' " (to a town which he designed attack- ing). In Nicaragua
            he was taken by the Indians, who, being entirely on the Spanish side, tore him to pieces
            and burned him. Thus we really must not be deluded by the professions of Mr Kingsley's
            sentimental buccaneer, with his pity for " the Indian folk of old ". Except Denis Scott,
            a worthy bandit in his day, Captain Henry Morgan is the first renowned British
            buccaneer. He was a young Welshman, who, after having been sold as a slave in Barbadoes,
            became a sailor of fortune. With about four hundred men he assailed Puerto Bello. " If
            our number is small ", he said, " our hearts are great ", and so he assailed the third
            city and place of arms which Spain then possessed in the West Indies. The entrance of
            the harbour was protected by two strong castles, judged as " almost impregnable ", while
            Morgan had no artillery of any avail against fortresses. Morgan had the luck to capture
            a Spanish soldier, whom he compelled to parley with the garrison of the castle. This he
            xviii ADVENTURES OF BUCCANEERS stormed and blew up, massacring all its defenders, while
            with its guns he disarmed the sister fortress. When all but de- feated in a new assault,
            the sight of the English colours animated him afresh. He made the captive monks and nuns
            carry the scaling ladders ; in this unwonted exploit the poor religious folk lost many
            of their numbers. The wall was mounted, the soldiers were defeated, though the Governor
            fought like a Spaniard of the old school, slew many pirates with his own hand, and
            pistolled some of his own men for cowardice. He died at his post, refusing quarter, and
            falling like a gentleman of Spain. Morgan, too, was not wanting in fortitude : he
            extorted 100,000 pieces-of-eight from the Governor of Panama, and sent him a pistol as a
            sample of the gun wherewith he took so great a city. He added that he would return and
            take this pistol out of Panama ; nor was he less good than his word. In Cuba he divided
            250,000 pieces-of- eight, and a great booty in other treasure. A few weeks saw it all in
            the hands of the tavern-keepers and women of the place. Morgan's next performance was a
            new sack of Maracaibo, now much stronger than L'Olonnois had found it. After the most
            appalling cruelties, not fit to be told, he returned, passing the castles at the mouth
            of the port by an ingenious stratagem. Running boatload after boatload of men to the
            land side, he brought them back by stealth, leading the garrison to expect an attack
            from that quarter. The guns were massed to land- ward, and no sooner was this done than
            Morgan sailed up through the channel with but little loss. Why the Spaniards did not
            close the passage with a boom does not appear. Probably they were glad to be quit of
            Morgan on any terms. A great Spanish fleet he routed by the ingenious employ- ment of a
            fire-ship. In a later expedition a strong place was taken by a curious accident. One of
            the buccaneers was shot through the body with an arrow. He drew it out, wrapped it in
            cotton, fired it from his musket, and so set light to a roof and burned the town. His
            raid on Panama was extraordinary for the endurance of his men. For days they lived on
            the leather of bottles and belts. " Some, who were never out of their mothers' kitchens,
            may ask how these pirates could eat and digest these pieces of leather, so hard and dry
            ? Whom I answer — that could they ADVENTURES OF BUCCANEERS xix once experience what
            hunger, or rather famine is, they would find the way, as the pirates did ". It was at
            the close of this march that the Indians drove wild bulls among them ; but they cared
            very little for these new allies of the Spaniards : beef, in any form, was only too
            welcome. Morgan burned the fair cedar houses of Panama, but lost the plate ship with all
            the gold and silver out of the churches. How he tortured a poor wretch who chanced to
            wear a pair of taffety trousers belonging to his master, with a small silver key hanging
            out, it is better not to repeat. The men only got two hundred pieces-of -eight each,
            after all their toil, for their Welshman was indeed a thief, and bilked his crews, no
            less than he plundered the Spaniards, without remorse. Finally, he sneaked away from the
            fleet with a ship or two ; and it is to be feared that Captain Morgan made rather a good
            thing by dint of his incredible cruelty and villainy. And so we leave Mr Esquemeling,
            whom Captain Morgan also deserted ; for who would linger long when there is not even
            honour among thieves ? Alluring as the pirate's pro- fession is, we must not forget that
            it had a seamy side, and was by no means all rum and pieces-of-eight. And there is
            something repulsive to a generous nature in roasting men be- cause they will not show
            you where to steal hogs. AN ADVERTISEMENT TO THE READER CONCERNING THIS SECOND EDITION
            The first edition of this History of the Buccaneers was received with such general
            applause of most people, hut more especially of the learned, as to encourage me towards
            obliging the public with this second impression, though within the space of three months
            of time. This I have completed with the same cuts and maps, and all the other
            embellishments which the former had ; and yet rendered it by the closeness of its
            character more easy to he purchased, as being comprehended in a fewer number of sheets
            of paper. Unto this second edition I have also added some relations which have been
            imparted to me from good and authentic hands ; wherein are contained several other hold
            exploits and attempts, performed of late years by the same Buccaneers, especially since
            the time that the author of the first impression left those parts of the West Indies,
            and published his book in Holland. These are comprehended in two or three chapters at
            the latter end of this second edition, and do chiefly relate unto the adventures of
            Captain Cook in the year 1678, and the hazardous and hold attempts of Captain Sharp and
            others ; who lately, setting forth from famaica, penetrated into the South Sea, and
            there ransacked and pillaged, for the space of three years, all they could meet,
            returning at last homewards about the Tierra del Fuego, commonly called Terra Australis
            Incognita, beyond the Strait of Magellan ; and thus performing one of the boldest and
            longest voyages that ever was attempted in the world. Of all which voyage, and
            especially of all the soundings, ports, harbours, rivers, creeks, islands, rocks, towns,
            and cities belongiftg unto the whole navigation of the South Sea, he hath brought home
            such an exact description, and such complete maps, taken from the Spaniards themselves,
            who only navigate that ocean, as were never seen in these parts of the world before. 2
            ADVERTISEMENT TO THE READER The very Journal of this triennial navigation, I am
            informed, is 710W in the press, being published by a worthy gentleman of my acquaintance
            ; the perusal whereof I hope will acquit what I have said to be nothing more nor less
            than the very truth itself. What I here give my reader concerning Captain Sharp and his
            companions is only a short account of his transactions, which may serve for an
            accomplishment of this History of the Buccaneers (he being one of the same profession) ;
            which I received from the very hand of one of his seamen who was present at these
            exploits [and which was printing before I heard of the Journal of Captain Sharp) : the
            which likewise how far it will agree with the Journal itself [as I hear is almost ready
            to be published) I cannot easily declare, as having not seen nor perused the said book.
            Yet thus much I am induced to believe of this narrative, though never so shortly
            compiled, that it will not much deviate from the substance of what matter of fact will
            be there rehearsed, and that the said Journal, when published, will appear, for its
            novelty and curiosity, to be as it were a Second Part of this History of the Buccaneers.
            All which notwithstanding, something may be yet remaining behind of this nature,
            wherewith in di^e time I may chance to pleasure the public, but not to be added to this
            volume, but to be a volume of itself, this first volume of the Buccajteers being as full
            as it can be made. Whatever shall for the future be published by me shall be put into
            another volume. THE TRANSLATOR TO THE READER The present volume, both for Us curiosity
            and ingenuity, I dare recommend to the perusal of our English nation, whose glorious
            actions it contains. What relates to the curiosity hereof, this piece, both of natural
            and human history, was no sooner published in the Dutch original than it was snatched up
            for the most curious libraries of Holland : it was translated into Spanish (two
            impressions thereof being sent into Spain in one year) ; it was taken notice of by the
            learned Academy of Paris ; and finally recommended as worthy of our esteem by the
            ingenious author of the ' Weekly Memorials for the Ingenious \ printed here at London
            about two years ago. Neither all this undeservedly, seeing it enlarges our acquaintance
            of natural history, so much prized a7id inquired for by the learned of this present age,
            with several observations not easily to be found in other accounts already received from
            America ; and, besides, it informs us (with huge novelty) of as great and bold attempts
            in point of military conduct and valour as ever were performed by mankind, without
            excepting here either Alexander the Great or Julius CcBsar or the rest of the Nine
            Worthies of Fame. Of all which actions, as we cannot but confess ourselves to have been
            ignorant hitherto (the very name of ' Buccaneers ' being as yet known but to few of the
            ingenious, as their lives, laws, and conversation are in a manner unto none), so can
            they not choose but be admired, out of this ingenious Author, by whosoever is curious to
            learn the various revolutions of human affairs. But, more especially by our English
            nation, as unto whom these things more narrowly do appertain — we having here more than
            half the book filled with the unparalleled if not inimitable adventures and heroic
            exploits of our own countrymen and relations, whose undaunted and exemplary courage,
            when called upon by our King and Country, we ought to emulate. From whence it has
            proceeded that nothing of this kind was 4 TRANSLATOR TO THE READER ever as yet published
            in England I cannot easily determine, except, as some will say, from some secret '
            Ragion di Stato '. Let the reason be as it will, this is certain, so much the more we
            are obliged to this present author, who, though a stranger to our nation, yet with that
            candour and fidelity has recorded our actions, as to render the metal of our true
            English valour to be the more believed and feared abroad than if these things had been
            divulged by ourselves at home. From hence peradventure will other nations learn that the
            English people are of their genius more inclinable to act than to write ; seeing as well
            they as we have lived unacquainted with these actions of our nation, until such time as
            a foreign author to our country came to tell them. Besides the merit of this piece for
            its curiosity, another point of no less esteem is the truth and sincerity wherewith
            everything seems to be penned. No greater ornament or dignity can be added to history,
            either human or natural, than truth. All other embellishments, if this be failing, are
            of little or no esteem ; if this be delivered, are either needless or superfluous. What
            concerns this requisite in our author, his lines do everywhere declare the faithfulness
            and sincerity of his mind. He writes not by hearsay, but was an eye-witness, as he
            somewhere tells you, to all and every one of the bold and hazardous attempts which he
            relates. And these he delivers with such candour of style, such ingenuity of mind, such
            plainness of words, such conciseness of periods, so much divested of rhetorical
            hyperboles or the least flourishes of eloquence, so hugely void of passion or national
            reflections, that he strongly persuades all along to the credit of what he says — yea,
            raises the mind of the reader to believe these things far greater than what he has said
            ; and, having read him, leaves only this scruple or concern behind, that you can read
            him no longer. In a word, such are his deserts that some persons peradventure would not
            stickle to compare him to the Father of Historians, Philip de Comines : at least, thus
            much may be said with all truth imaginable, that he resembles that great author in many
            of his excellent qualities. I know some persons have objected to the greatness of these
            prodigious adventures, intimating that the resistance our Bucca- neers fomid in America
            was everywhere but small. For the Spaniards, say they, in the West Indies are become of
            late years nothing less, but rather much more, degenerate than in Europe, the co7itinual
            peace they have enjoyed in those parts, TRANSLATOR TO THE READER 5 the defect of
            military discipline, and European soldiers for their commanders, much contributing
            hereunto. But more especially and above all other reasons the very luxury of the soil
            and riches, the extreme heat of those countries and influence of the stars being such as
            totally incline their bodies to an infinite effeminacy and cowardice of mind. Unto these
            reasons I shall only answer in brief : This History will convince them to be manifestly
            false. For, as to the contifiual peace here alleged, we know thai no peace could ever be
            established ' beyond the Line,' since the first possession of the West Indies by the
            Spaniards till the burning of Panama. At that time, or a few months before. Sir William
            Godolphin by his prudent negociation in quality of Ambassador for our most Gracious
            Monarch concluded at Madrid a peace to be observed even beyond the Line and through the
            whole extent of the Spanish Dominions in the West Indies. This transaction gave the
            Spaniards new causes of complaint against our proceedings, that no sooner a peace had
            been established for those parts of America but our Forces had taken and burnt both
            Chagre, St Catharine, and Panama. But our reply was convincing : That, whereas eight or
            ten months had been allowed by Articles for the publishing of the said peace through all
            the dominions of both monarchies in America, those hostilities had been committed, not
            only without orders from his Majesty of England but also within the space of the said
            eight or ten months of time. Until that time the Spanish inhabitants of America being,
            as it were, in a perpetual war with Europe, certain it is that no coasts nor kingdoms in
            the world have been more frequently infested or alarmed with the invasions of several
            nations than theirs. Thus, from the very beginning of their conquests in America, both
            English, French, Dutch, Portuguese, Swedes, Danes, Cour- landers, and all other nations
            that navigate the ocean have frequented the West Indies, and filled them with their
            robberies and assaults. From these occasions have they been in continual watch and ward,
            and kept their militia in constant exercise, as also their garrisons pretty well
            provided and paid ; as fearing every sail they discovered at sea to be pirates of one
            nation or another. But much more especially, since that CuraQoa, Tortuga, and famaica
            have been inhabited by English, French, and Dutch, and bred up that race of huntsmen
            than which no other ever was more desperate nor more mortal enemies to the 6 TRANSLATOR
            TO THE READER Spaniards, called Buccaneers. Now shall we say thai these people, through
            too long continuation of peace, have utterly abolished the exercises of war, having been
            all along incessantly vexed with the tumults and alarms thereof? In like manner is it
            false to accuse their defect of military discipline for want of European commanders. For
            who knows not that all places, both military and civil, through those vast dominions of
            the West Indies are provided out of Spain ? And those of the militia most commonly given
            to expert commanders trained up from their infancy in the Wars of Europe, either in
            Africa, Milan, Sicily, Naples, or Flanders, fighting against either English, French,
            Dutch, Portuguese, or Moors ? Yea, their very garrisons, if you search them in those
            parts, will peradventure be found to be stocked three parts to four with soldiers both
            born and bred in the kingdom of Spain. From these considerations it may be inferred what
            little difference ought to be allowed betwixt the Spanish soldiers, inhabitants of the
            West Indies, and those of Europe. And how little the soil or climate has influenced or
            caused their courage to degenerate towards cowardice or basejiess of mind. As if the
            very same arguments, deduced from the nature of that climate, did not equally militate
            against the valour of our famous Buccaneers, and represent this to be of as degenerate
            metal as theirs. But nothing can be more clearly evinced than is the valour of the
            American Spaniards, either soldiers or officers, by the sequel of this history. What men
            ever fought more desperately than the garrison of Chagre — their number being 314, and
            of all these only 30 remaining ; of which number scarce 10 were unwounded, and among
            them not one officer found alive ? Were not 600 killed upon the spot at Panama, 500 at
            Gibraltar, almost as many more at Puerto del Principe, all dying with their arms in
            their hands and facing bravely the enemy for the defence of their country and private
            concerns ? Did not those of the town of San Pedro both fortify themselves, lay several
            ambuscades, and lastly sell their lives as dear as ever any European soldier could do,
            L'Ollonais being forced to gain step by step his advance unto the town with huge loss
            both of blood and men ? Many other in- stances might be produced out of this compendious
            volume of the generous resistance the Spaniards made in several places, though fortune
            favoured not their arms. TRANSLATOR TO THE READER 7 Next, as to the personal valour of
            many of their commanders, what man ever behaved himself more briskly than the Governor
            of Gibraltar, than the Governor of Puerto del Principe, both dying for the defence of
            their towns; than Don Alonso del Campo, and others ? Or what examples can easily
            parallel the desperate courage of the Governor of Chagre, who, though the palisades were
            fired, the terrepleins [ramparts] were sunk into the ditch, the breaches were entered,
            the houses all burnt about him, the whole castle taken, his men all killed, yet would
            not admit of any quarter, but chose rather to die under his arms, being shot into the
            brain, than surrender himself as a prisoner to the Buccaneers ? What lion ever fought to
            the last gasp more obstinately than the Governor of Porto Bello, who, seeing the town
            entered by surprisal in the night, one chief castle blown up into the air, all the other
            forts and castles taken, his own assaulted several ways, both religious men and women
            placed at the front of the enemy to fix the ladders against the walls, yet spared not to
            kill as many of the said religious persons as he could ; and at last, the walls being
            scaled, the castle entered and taken, all his own men overcome by fire and sword, who
            had cast down their arms and begged mercy from the enemy, yet would admit of none for
            his own life ? Yea, with his own hands killed several of his soldiers, to force them to
            stand to their arms though all were lost. Yea, though his own wife and daughter begged
            of him upon their knees that he would save his life by craving quarter, though the enemy
            desired of him the same thing, yet would hearken to no cries nor persuasions, but they
            were forced to kill him, combating with his arms in his hands, being not otherwise able
            to take him prisoner as they were desirous to do. Shall these men be said to be
            influenced with cowardice, who thus acted to the very last scene of their own tragedies
            ? Or shall we rather say that they wanted not courage, but fortune ? — it being
            certainly true that he who is killed in a battle may be equally courageous with him that
            kills. And that whosoever derogates from the valour of the Spaniards in the West Indies
            dimiftishes in like manner the courage of the Buccaneers, his own countrymen, who have
            seemed to act beyond mortal men in America. Now, to say something concerning John
            Esquemcling, the first author of this history. I take him to be a Dutchman, or at least
            born in Flanders, notwithstanding that the Spanish translation represents him to be
            native of the kingdom of France — his printing 8 TRANSLATOR TO THE READER this history
            originally in Dutch, which doubtless must he his native tongue, who otherwise was hut an
            illiterate man, together with the very sound of his name, convincing me thereunto. True
            it is, he set sail from France, and was some years at Tortuga, hut neither of these two
            arguments, drawn from the history, are prevalent. For, were he a Frenchman horn, how
            came he to learn the Dutch language so perfectly as to prefer it to his own — especially
            that not being spoken at Tortuga nor famaica, where he resided all the while ? I hope I
            have made this English translation something more plain and correct than the Spanish.
            Some few notorious faults, either of the printer or of the interpreter, I am sure I have
            redressed. But, the Spanish translator complaining much of the intricacy of style in the
            original (as flowing from a person who, as hath been said, was no scholar) as he was
            pardonable, being in great haste, for not rendering his own version so distinct and
            elaborate as he could desire — so must I be excused from the one, that is to say
            elegance, if I have cautiously declined the other, I mean confusion. t THE BUCCANEERS OF
            AMERICA PART I CHAPTER I The author sets forth towards the Western Islands, in the
            service of the West India Company of France. They meet with an English frigate, and
            arrive at the island of Tortuga We set sail from Havre de Grace, in France, in a ship
            called St fohn, the second day of May, in the year 1666. Our vessel was equipped with
            eight-and-twenty guns, 20 mariners, and 220 passengers, including in this number those
            whom the Company sent as free passengers, as being in their service. Soon after we came
            to an anchor under the Cape of Barfleur, there to join seven other ships of the same
            West India Company, which were to come from Dieppe under the convoy of a man-of-war,
            mounted with seven-and-thirty guns and 250 meny^ Of these ships two were bound for
            Senegal, five for the Laribbee Islands, and ours for the island of Tortuga. In the same
            place there gathered unto us about twenty sail of other ships that were bound for
            Newfoundland, with some Dutch vessels that were going for Nantes, Rochelle, and St
            Martins ; so that in all we made a fleet of thirty sail. Here we prepared to fight,
            putting ourselves into a convenient posture of defence, as having notice that four
            English frigates, of three-score guns each, did lie in wait for us about the Isle of
            Ornay. Our admiral, the Chevalier Sourdis, having dis- 10 THE AUTHOR SETS FORTH tributed
            what orders he thought convenient, we set sail from thence with a favourable gale of
            wind. 'Presently after, some mists arising, these totally impeded the English frigates
            from discovering our fleet at sea. We steered our course as near as we could under the
            coast of France for fear of the enemy. As we sailed along, we met a vessel of Ostend,
            who complained to our admiral that a French privateer had robbed him that very morning.
            This complaint being heard, we endeavoured to pursue the said pirate ; but our labour
            was in vain, as not being able to overtake him. Our fleet, as we went along, caused no
            small fears and alarms to the inhabitants of the coasts of France, these judging us to
            be English and that we sought some convenient place for landing. To allay their frights,
            we used to hang out our colours ; but, notwithstanding, they would not trust usy After
            this we came to an anchor in the Bay of Conquet, in Brittany, nigh unto the Isle of
            Ushant, there to take in water. Having stored ourselves with fresh provisions at this
            place, we prosecuted our voyage, designing to pass by the Ras of Fonteneau and not
            expose ourselves to the Sorlingues, fearing the English vessels that were cruising
            thereabouts to meet us. This river Ras is of a current very strong and rapid, which,
            rolling over many rocks, disgorges itself into the sea on the coast of France, in the
            latitude of eight-and-forty degrees and ten minutes. For which reason this passage is
            very dangerous, all the rocks as yet being not thoroughly known. / Here I shall not omit
            to mention the ceremony which at this passage, and some other places, is used by the
            mariners, and by them called ' Baptism ', although it may seem either little to our
            purpose or of no use. The master's mate clothed him- self with a ridiculous sort of
            garment that reached unto his feet, and on his head he put a suitable cap, which was
            made very burlesque. In his right hand he placed a naked wooden sword, and in his left a
            pot full of ink. His face was horribly blacked with soot, and his neck adorned with a
            collar of many little pieces of wood. Being thus apparelled, he commanded to be called
            before him every one of them who never had passed that dangerous place before. And then,
            causing them to kneel down in his presence, he made the sign of the Cross upon their
            foreheads with ink, and gave each one a stroke on the shoulders with his wooden sword.
            Meanwhile the standers-by did cast CEREMONY OF THE DUTCH ii a bucket of water upon every
            man's head ; and this was the conclusion of the ceremony. But, that being ended, every
            one of the baptized is obHged to give a bottle of brandy for his offering, placing it
            nigh the main-mast, and without speaking a word, even those who have no such liquor
            being not excused from this performance. In case the vessel never passed that way
            before, the Captain is obliged to distribute some wine among the mariners and other
            people in the ship. But, as for other gifts which the newly baptized do frequently
            offer, they are divided among the old seamen, and of them they make a banquet among
            themselves. / The Hollanders likewise do use to baptize such as never passed that way
            before. And not only at the passage above- mentioned, but also at the rocks called
            Berlingues, near the coast of Portugal, in the latitude of 39 degrees and 40 minutes, as
            being a passage very dangerous, especially by night, when through the obscurity thereof
            the rocks are not distinguish- able, by reason the land is very high, they use some such
            ceremony. But their manner of baptizing is quite distinct from that which we have
            described above as performed by the French. He, therefore, that is to be baptized is
            fastened, and hoisted up three times at the main-yard's end, as if he were a criminal.
            If he be hoisted the fourth time, in the name of the Prince of Orange or of the captain
            of the vessel, his honour is more than ordinary. Thus they are dipped, every one,
            several times into the main ocean. But he that is the first dipped has the honour of
            being saluted with a gun. Such as are not willing to fall are bound to pay twelve pence
            for their ransom ; if he be an officer in the ship, two shiUings; and, if a passenger,
            according to his pleasure. In case the ship never passed that way before, the captain is
            bound to give a small runlet of wine, which, if he does not perform, the mariners may
            cut off the stem of the vessel. All the profit which accrues by this ceremony is kept by
            the master's mate, who, after reaching their port, doth usually lay it out in wine,
            which is drunk amongst the ancient seamen. Some will say this ceremony was instituted by
            the Emperor Charles the Fifth ; howsoever, it is not found amongst his Laws. But here I
            leave these customs of the sea, and shall return to our voyage. Having passed the river
            Ras, we met with very good weather 12 ARRIVAL AT ISLAND OF TORTUGA until we came to Cape
            Finisterre. Here a huge tempest of wind surprised us, and separated our ship from the
            rest that were in our company. This storm continued for the space of eight days, in
            which time it would move compassion to see how miserably the passengers were tumbled to
            and fro on all sides of the ship ; insomuch as the mariners in the performance of their
            duty were compelled to tread upon them everywhere. This uncouthsome weather being spent,
            we had again the use of very favourable gales until we came unto the Tropic of Cancer.
            This Tropic is nothing else but an imaginary circle which astrologers have invented in
            the heavens, and serves as a period to the progress of the sun towards the North Pole.
            It is placed in the latitude of 23 degrees and 30 minutes under the line. Here we were
            baptized the second time, after the same manner as before. The French do always perform
            this ceremony at this Tropic, as also under the Tropic of Capricorn, towards the South.
            In this part of the world we had very favourable weather, at which we were infinitely
            gladdened by reason of our great necessity of water. For at this time that element was
            already so scarce with us that we were stinted unto two half-pints per man every day.
            Being about the latitude of Barbados, we met an English frigate, or privateer, who first
            began to give us chase ; but, finding himself not to exceed us in strength, did
            presently steer away from us. This flight gave us occasion to pursue the said frigate,
            as we did, shooting at him several guns of eight-pound carriage. But at length he
            escaped, and we returned to our course. Not long after, we came within sight of the isle
            of Martinique. Our endeavours were bent towards the coast of the Isle of St Peter. But
            these were frustrated by reason of a storm which took us hereabouts. Hence we resolved
            to steer to the island of Guadaloupe. Yet neither this island could we reach by reason
            of the said storm, and thus we directed our course to the isle of Tortuga, which was the
            very same land we were bound unto. We passed along the coast of the isle of Porto Rico,
            which is extremely deli- cious and agreeable to the view, as being adorned with
            beautiful trees and woods, even to the tops of the mountains. After this, we discovered
            the island Hispaniola^ (of which I ^ The English corruption of Espailola [" Little Spain
            "], the name given by Columbus to the island of Haiti, discovered by him in 1492,
            ARRIVAL AT ISLAND OF TORTUGA 13 shall give a description in this book), and we coasted
            about it until we came unto the isle of Tortuga, our desired port. Here we anchored the
            seventh day of July in the same year, not having lost one man in the whole voyage. We
            unladed the goods that belonged unto the Company of the West Indies, and soon after the
            ship was sent to Cul de Sac with some passengers. whereon he established the first
            Spanish colony in the New World. Subsequently it was neglected and became the prey of
            freebooters and Buccaneers. In old Latin maps it is called Hispaniae Insula. Next to
            Cuba, it is the largest of the West Indian islands. It was later divided politically
            into the republics of Haiti and Santo Domingo, the latter called after the city of that
            name. CHAPTER II Description of the island of Tortuga : of the fruits and plants there
            growing ; how the French settled there, at two several times, and cast out the
            Spaniards, first masters thereof. The author of this hook was twice sold in the said
            island The island of Tortuga is situated on the North side of the famous and great
            island called Hispaniola [Haiti], nigh unto the continent thereof and in the latitude of
            twenty degrees and thirty minutes. Its just extent is threescore leagues about. The
            Spaniards, who gave name to this island, called it so from the shape of the land, which
            in some manner resem- bles a great sea-tortoise, called by them tortuga de mar. The
            country is very mountainous and full of rocks, yet, notwith- standing, hugely thick of
            lofty trees that cease not to grow upon the hardest of those rocks without partaking of
            a softer soil. Hence it comes that their roots, for the greatest part, are seen all over
            entangled among the rocks, not unlike unto the branching of ivy against our walls. That
            part of this island which stretches towards the North is totally disin- habited. The
            reason is, first, because it has proved to be very incommodious and unhealthy, and,
            secondly, for the rugged- ness of the coast, that gives no access to the shore, unless
            among rocks almost inaccessible. For this cause it is populated only on the Southern
            part, which has only one port that may be esteemed indifferently good. Yet this harbour
            has two several entries, or channels, which afford passage unto ships of 70 guns, the
            port itself being without danger and capable of receiving a great number of vessels.
            That part which is inhabited is divided into four other parts, of which the first is
            called the Low-Land, or Low-Country. This is the chiefest among the rest, because it
            contains the aforesaid port. The town is called Cayona, and here do live 14 THE ISLAND
            OF TORTUGA 13 the chief and richest planters of the island. The second part is called
            the Middle Plantation. Its territory, or soil, is hitherto almost new, as being only
            known to be good for the culture of tobacco. The third is named Ringot. These places are
            situated towards the Western part of the island. The fourth, and last, is called The
            Mountain, in which place were made the first plantations that were cultivated upon this
            island. As to the wood that grows on the island, we have already said that the trees are
            exceedingly tall and pleasing to the sight ; whence no man will doubt but they may be
            applied unto several uses with great benefit. Such is the Yellow Saunder, which tree by
            the inhabitants of this country is called bois de chandelle, or in English Candlewood,
            because it burns like a candle, and serves them with light while they use their fishery
            in the night. Here also grows lignum sanctum, by others called guaiacum, the virtues of
            which are very well known, more especially unto them who observe not the sixth
            Commandment and are given to all manner of impure copulations, physicians drawing from
            hence, under several compositions, the greatest antidote for all venereal diseases, as
            also for cold and vicious humours. The trees likewise that afford gummi elemi grow here
            in great abundance, and in like manner radix Chinee, or China root ^ ; yet this is not
            so good as that which comes from other parts of the Western world. It is very white and
            soft, and serves for pleasant food unto the wild-boars when they can find nothing else.
            This island also is not deficient in aloes, nor an infinite number of other medicinal
            herbs, which may please the curiosity of such as are given to their contemplation.
            Moreover for the building of ships, or any other sort of architecture, here are found,
            in this spot of Neptune, several sorts of timber very convenient. The fruits, likewise,
            which here abundantly grow, are nothing inferior, as to their quantity or quality, unto
            what the adjacent islands pro- duced. I shall name only some of the most ordinary and
            common. Such are magniot^, potatoes, acajou apples ^ * See note 2 on p. 31. • Obsolete

            yannas^, bacones, paquayes, carosoles, mamayns^, ananas^, and diverse other sorts,
            which, not to be tedious, I omit to specify. Here grow likewise in huge number those
            trees called palmettos, or palmites*, whence is drawn a certain juice which serves the
            inhabitants instead of wine, and whose leaves do cover their houses instead of tiles. In
            this island abounds also, with daily increase, the wild- boar. The Governor has
            prohibited the hunting of them with dogs, fearing lest, the island being but small, the
            whole race of those animals in short time should be destroyed. The reason why he thought
            convenient to preserve those wild- beasts was that in case of any invasion of an
            external enemy the inhabitants might sustain themselves with their food, especially if
            they were constrained to retire unto the woods and mountains. By this means he judged
            they were enabled to maintain any sudden assault or long persecution. Yet this sort of
            game is almost impeded by itself, by reason of the many rocks and precipices, which for
            the greatest part are covered with little shrubs, very green and thick, whence the
            huntsmen have ofttimes precipitated themselves, and left us the sad experience and grief
            of many memorable disasters. At a certain time of the year there resort unto this island
            of Tortuga huge flocks of wild-pigeons, at which season the inhabitants feed on them
            very plentifully, having more than they can consume, and leaving totally to their repose
            all other sorts of fowl, both wild and tame, to the intent that in absence of the
            pigeons these may supply their place. But as nothing in the universe, though never so
            pleasant, can be found but what has something of bitterness joined to it, the bignesse
            like a soiben, the fruit whereof is by them called Aca-iou, of forme and greatness like
            a hennes egge, which being ripe is of a golde yellow colour like a quince, very good and

            aforesaid pigeons. For these, the season being past wherein God has appointed them to
            afford deHcious food unto those people, can scarcely be touched with the tongue, they
            become so extremely lean and bitter even to admiration. The reason of this bitterness is
            attributed unto a certain seed which they eat about that time, even as bitter as gall.
            About the sea-shores every- where are found great multitudes of crabs belonging both to
            the land and sea, and both sorts very big. These are good to feed servants and slaves^,
            who find them very pleasing to the palate, yet withal very hurtful to the sight. Besides
            which symptom, being eaten too often, they also cause great giddi- ness in the head,
            with much weakness of the brain, insomuch that very frequently they are deprived of
            sight for the space of one quarter of an hour. The French, having established themselves
            in the isle of St Christopher, planted there a sort of trees, of which at present there
            possibly may be greater quantities. With the timber of those trees they made long-boats
            and hoys^ which they sent thence westward, being well manned and victualled, to discover
            other islands. These, setting sail from St Christopher, came within sight of the island
            of Hispaniola, where at length they arrived with abundance of joy. Having landed, they
            marched into the country, where they found huge quantities of cattle, such as cows,
            bulls, horses, and wild- boars. But finding no great profit in those animals unless they
            could enclose them, and knowing likewise the island to be pretty well peopled by the
            Spaniards, they thought it convenient to enterprize upon and seize the island of
            Tortuga. This they performed without any difficulty, there being upon the island no more
            than ten or twelve Spaniards to guard it. These few men let the French come in peaceably
            and possess the island for the space of six months, without any trouble. In the
            meanwhile they passed and repassed with their canoes to Hispaniola, whence they
            transported many people, and at last began to plant the whole isle of Tortuga. The few *

            TORTUGA Spaniards remaining there, perceiving the French to increase their number daily,
            began at last to repine at their prosperity and grudged them the possession they had
            freely given. Hence they gave notice to others of their own nation, their neighbours,
            who sent several great boats, well armed and manned, to dispossess the French of that
            island. This expedition succeeded according to their desires. For the new possessors,
            seeing the great number of Spaniards that came against them, fled with all they had unto
            the woods ; and hence by night they wafted over with canoes unto the isle of Hispaniola.
            This they more easily performed as having no women or children with them, nor any great
            substance to carry away. Here they also retired into the woods, both to seek themselves
            food, and thence with secrecy to give intelligence to others of their own faction, as
            judging for cer- tain that within a little while they should be in a capacity to hinder
            the Spaniards from fortifying in Tortuga. Meanwhile the Spaniards of the greater island
            ceased not to seek after their new guests, the French, with intent to root them out of
            the woods, if possible, or cause them to perish with hunger. But this their design soon
            failed, having found that the French were masters both of good guns, powder, and
            bullets. Here, therefore, the fugitives waited for a certain opportunity, wherein they
            knew the Spaniards were to come from Tortuga, with arms and great number of men, to join
            with those of the greater island for their destruction. When this occasion proffered,
            they in the meanwhile deserting the woods where they were, returned unto Tortuga, and
            dis- possessed the small number of Spaniards that remained at home. Having so done, they
            fortified themselves as best they could, thereby to prevent the return of the Spaniards,
            in case they should attempt it. Moreover, they sent immediately unto the Governor of St
            Christopher, craving his aid and relief, and demanding of him to send them a Governor,
            the better to be united among themselves and strengthened on all occasions. The Governor
            of St Christopher received their petition with expressions of much satisfaction and
            without any delay sent to them Monsieur le Passeur in quality of a Governor, together
            with a ship full of men and all other things necessary both for their establishment and
            defence. No sooner had they received this recruit than THE SPANIARDS ATTACK TORTUGA 19
            the Governor commanded a fortress to be built upon the top of a high rock, whence he
            could hinder the access of any ships or other vessels that should design to enter the
            port. Unto this fort no other access could be had than by almost climbing through a very
            narrow passage that was capable only of receiving two persons at once, and those not
            without difficulty. In the middle of this rock was a great cavity, which now serves for
            a storehouse ; and, besides, here was a great convenience for raising a battery. The
            fort being finished, the Governor commanded two guns to be mounted, which could not be
            performed without huge toil and labour, as also a house to be built within the fort ;
            and, afterwards, the narrow way that led unto the said fort to be broken and demolished,
            leaving no other ascent thereto than by a ladder. Within the fort gushes out a plentiful
            fountain of fresh water, which perpetually runs with a pure and crystalline stream
            sufficient to refresh a garrison of a thousand men. Being possessed of these
            conveniences, and the security these things might promise, the French began to people
            the island, and each of them to seek his living, some by the exercise of hunting, others
            by planting tobacco, and others by cruising and robbing upon the coasts of the Spanish
            islands — which trade is continued by them to this day. The Spaniards, notwithstanding,
            could not behold but with jealous eyes the daily increase of the French in Tortuga,
            fearing lest in time they might by them be dispossessed also of Hispaniola. Thus, taking
            an opportunity when many of the French were abroad at sea and others employed in
            hunting, with 800 men in several canoes, they landed again in Tortuga, almost without
            being perceived by the French. But, finding that the Governor had cut down many trees,
            for the better discovery of an enemy in case of any assault, as also that nothing of
            consequence could be done without great guns, they consulted about the fittest place for
            raising a battery. This place was soon concluded to be the top of a mountain which was
            in sight, seeing that thence alone they could level their guns at the fort, which now
            lay open to them since the cutting down of the trees by the new possessors. Hence they
            resolved to open a way for carriage of some pieces of ordnance to the top. This mountain
            is somewhat high, and the upper part thereof plain, from whence the whole island 20 THE
            SPANIARDS ATTACK TORTUGA may be viewed. The sides thereof are very rugged by reason of
            an huge number of inaccessible rocks surrounding it everywhere ; so that the ascent was
            very difficult, and would always have been the same, had not the Spaniards undergone the
            immense labour and toil of making the way aforemen- tioned, as I shall now relate. The
            Spaniards had in their company many slaves and Indians, labouring men, whom they call
            matates, or, in English, half-yellow men. Unto these they gave orders with iron tools to
            dig a way through the rocks. This they performed with the greatest speed imaginable. And
            through this way by the help of many ropes and pulleys, they at last made shift to get
            up two sole cannon-pieces, wherewith they made a battery, and intended next day to
            batter the fort. Mean- while the French were not ignorant of these designs, but rather
            prepared themselves for a defence (while the Spaniards were busied about the battery),
            sending notice everywhere to their companions and requiring their help. Thus the hunters
            of the island all joined together, and with them all the pirates who were not already
            too far from home. These landed by night at Tortuga, lest they should be seen by the
            Spaniards. And, under the same obscurity of the night, they all together by a back way
            climbed up the mountain where the Spaniards were posted ; which they more easily could
            perform as being acquainted with those rocks. They came thither at the very instant that
            the Spaniards, who were above, were preparing to shoot at the fort, not knowing in the
            least of their coming. Here they set upon them, at their backs, with such fury as forced
            the greatest part to precipitate themselves from the top to the bottom, and dash their
            bodies in pieces. Few or none escaped this attack, for if any remained alive they were
            all put to the sword, without giving quarter to the meanest. Some Spaniards did still
            keep the bottom of the mountain, but, hearing the shrieks and cries of them that were
            killed and believing some tragical revolution to be above, fled immediately towards the
            sea, despairing, through this accident, to ever regain the isle of Tortuga. ^ The
            Governors of this island did always behave themselves as proprietors and absolute lords
            thereof until the year 1664 ; at which time the West India Company of France took
            possession thereof, and sent thither for their Governor THE SPANIARDS ATTACK TORTUGA 21
            Monsieur Ogeron. These planted the colony for themselves, by the means of their factors
            and servants, thinking to drive some considerable trade thence with the Spaniards, even
            as the Hollanders do from Cura^oa. But this design did not answer their expectation. For
            with other nations they could drive no trade, by reason they could not establish any
            secure commerce from the beginning with their own. Forasmuch as at the first institution
            of this Company in France, they made an agreement with the pirates, hunters, and
            planters, first possessors of Tortuga, that these should buy all their necessaries from
            the said Company, taking them upon trust. And, although this agreement was put in
            execution, yet the factors of the Company soon after found that they could not recover
            either moneys or returns from those people. Insomuch as they were constrained to bring
            some armed men into the island, in behalf of the Company, for to get in some of their
            payments. But neither this endeavour nor any other could prevail towards settling the
            secure trade with those of the island. And hereupon the Company recalled their factors,
            giving them orders to sell all that was their own in the said plantation, both the
            servants belonging to the Company (which were sold, some for 20, others for 30, pieces-
            of-eight)^, as also all other merchandizes and properties which they had there. With
            this resolution all their designs fell to the ground. In this occasion I was also sold,
            as being a servant under the said Company, in whose service I came out of France./ But
            my fortune was very bad, for I fell into the hands of the most cruel tyrant and
            perfidious man that ever was born of woman, who was then Governor, or rather
            Lieutenant-General, of that island. This man treated me with all the hard usages
            imaginable, yea, with that of hunger, with which I thought to have perished inevitably.
            Withal he was willing to let me buy my freedom and liberty, but not under the rate of
            300 pieces-of-eight, I not being master of one, at that time, in the whole world. At
            last through the manifold miseries I endured, as also affliction of mind, I was thrown
            into a dangerous fit of sickness. This misfortune, being added to the rest of my
            calamities, was the cause of my happiness. For my wicked master, seeing my condition,
            began to fear lest he should lose his moneys with my life. * See note on p. 60. 22 THE
            AUTHOR SOLD INTO SLAVERY Hereupon he sold me the second time to a surgeon for the price
            of 70 pieces-of -eight. Being in the hands of this second master, I began soon after to
            recover my health through the good usage I had received from him, as being much more
            humane and civil than that of my first patron. He gave me both clothes and very good
            food, and after that I had served him but one year he offered me my liberty, with only
            this condition, that I should pay him 100 pieces-of-eight when I was in a capacity of
            wealth so to do.. Which kind proposal of his I could not choose but accept with infinite
            joy and gratitude of mind. Being now at liberty, though like unto Adam when he was first
            created by the hands of his Maker — that is, naked and destitute of all human
            necessaries, nor knowing how to get my living — I determined to enter into the wicked
            order of the Pirates, or Robbers at Sea. Into this Society I was received with common
            consent both of the superior and vulgar sort, and among them I continued until the year
            1672. Having assisted them in all their designs and attempts, and served them in many
            notable exploits, of which hereafter I shall give the reader a true account, I returned
            to my own native country. But, before I begin to relate the things above-mentioned, I
            shall say something, for the satisfaction of such as are curious, of the island
            Hispaniola, which lies towards the Western parts of America, as also give my reader a
            brief description thereof, according to my slender ability and experience. CHAPTER III
            Description of the great and famous island of Hispaniola The very large and rich island
            called Hispaniola lies situate in the latitude of seventeen degrees and a half. The
            greatest part thereof extends, from East to West, 20 degrees Southern latitude. The
            circumference is 300 leagues, the length 120, its breadth almost 50, being more or less
            broad or narrow at certain places, I shall not need here to insert how this island was
            at first discovered, it being known unto the world that it was performed by the means of
            Christopher Columbus, in the year 1492, being sent for this purpose by Ferdinand the
            Catholic, then King of Spain. From which time, to this present, the Spaniards have been
            continually possessors thereof. There are upon this island many very good and 23 24 THE
            ISLAND OF HISPANIOLA strong cities, towns, and hamlets ; as also it abounds in a great
            number of pleasant and delicious country-houses and planta- tions — all which are owing
            unto the care and industry of the Spaniards, its inhabitants. The chief city and
            metropolis of this island is called San Domingo, being dedicated to St Dominic, from
            whom it derives this name. It is situated towards the South, in a place which affords a
            most excellent prospect, the country round about being embellished with innumerable rich
            plantations, as also verdant meadows and fruitful gardens — all which do produce plenty
            and variety of excellent and pleasant fruits, according to the nature of those
            countries. The Governor of the island makes his residence in this city, which is, as it
            were, the storehouse of all the other cities, towns, and villages, which hence export
            and provide themselves with all necessaries whatsoever for human life. And yet has it
            this particularity above many other cities in other places, that it entertains no
            external commerce with any other nation than its own, the Spaniards. The greatest part
            of the inhabi- tants are rich and substantial merchants, or such as are shop- keepers
            and do sell by retail. Another city of this island is named Santiago, or, in English, St
            James, as being consecrated to the Apostle of that name. This is an open place, without
            either walls or castle, situate in the latitude of 19 degrees South. The greatest part
            of the inhabitants are hunters and planters, the adjacent territory and soil being very
            proper for the said exercises of its constitu- tion. The city is surrounded with large
            and delicious fields, as much pleasing to the view as those of San Domingo ; and these
            abound with all sorts of beasts, both wild and tame, whence are taken a huge number of
            skins and hides, that afford unto the owners a very considerable traffic. Towards the
            Southern parts of this island is seen another city called Nuestra Seilora del Alta
            Gracia. The territory hereof produces great quantities of cacao, which occasions the
            inhabitants to make great store of the richest sort of chocolate. Here grows also much
            ginger and tobacco ; and much tallow is prepared of the beasts which hereabouts are
            hunted. ^ The inhabitants of this beautiful island of Hispaniola often go and come in
            their canoes to the Isle of Savona, not far THE ISLAND OF HISPANIOLA 25 distant thence,
            where is their chief fishery, expecially of tortoises. Hither those fish constantly
            resort in huge multitudes at certain seasons of the year, there to lay their eggs,
            burying them in the sands of the shore. Thus by the heat of the sun, which in those
            parts is very ardent, they are hatched, and continue the propagation of their species.
            This island of Savona has little or nothing that is worthy consideration or may merit
            any particular description, as being so extremely barren by reason of its sandy soil.
            True it is that here grows some small quantity of lignum sanctum or guaiacum, of whose
            use we have said something in another place. Westwards of the city of San Domingo is
            also situated another great village, called by the name of El Pueblo del Aso, or the
            Town of Aso. The inhabitants of this town drive a great commerce and traffic with those
            of another village, which is placed in the very middle of the island and is called San
            Juan de Goave, or St John of Goave. This place is environed with a magnificent prospect
            of gardens, woods, and meadows. Its territory extends above twenty leagues in length,
            and grazes an huge number of wild bulls and cows. In this village scarce dwell any
            others than hunters and butchers, who flay the beasts that are killed. These are for the
            most part a mongrel sort of people of several bloods ; some of which are born of white
            European people and negroes, and these are called mulattos. Others are born of Indians
            and white people, and such are termed mestizos'^. But others are begotten of negroes and
            Indians, and these also have their peculiar name, being called alcatraces^. Besides
            which sorts of people, there are several other species and races, both here and in other
            places of the West Indies, of whom this account may be given, that the Spaniards love
            better the negro women, in those Western parts, or the tawny Indian females, than their
            own white European race, when as peradventure the negroes * Cf, Hakluyt, Voyages [1600],
            vol. iii, p. 482 : " Paul Horsewell is married to a Mestisa, as they name those whose
            fathers were Spaniards, and their mothers Indians." • A nickname. " The alcatrace is a
            sea-fowle different to all that I have seen, either on the land or in the see. His head
            is like to the head of a gull, but his bill like unto a snytes bill, somewhat shorter
            and in all places alike. . . . He is all blacke of the colour of a crow." — Hawkins,
            Voyage into the South Sea [1593-1622], § xix (p. 153 of the 1878 edition). 26 THE ISLAND
            OF HISPANIOLA and Indians have greater inclinations to the white women, or those that
            come near them, the tawny, than their own. From the said village are exported yearly
            vast quantities of tallow and hides, they exercising no other traffic nor toil. For, as
            to the lands in this place, they are not cultivated, by reason of the excessive dryness
            of the soil. ^These are the chiefest places that the Spaniards possess in this island,
            from the Cape of Lobos towards St John de Goave unto the Cape of Samana, nigh the sea,
            on the North side, and from the Eastern part towards the sea, called Punta d'Espada. All
            the rest of the island is possessed by the French, who are also planters and hunters/
            This island has very good ports for ships, from the Cape of Lobos to the Cape of
            Tiburon, which lies on the Western side thereof. In this space of land there are no less
            than four ports, which exceed in goodness, largeness, and security even the very best of
            England. Besides these, from the Cape of Tiburon unto the Cape of Donna Maria, there are
            two very excellent ports, and from this Cape to the Cape of St Nicholas there are no
            less than twelve others. Every one of these ports has also the confluence of two or
            three good rivers, in which are found several sorts of fish, very pleasing to the palate
            and also in great plenty. The country hereabouts is sufficiently watered with large and
            profound rivers and brooks so that this part of the land may easily be cultivated
            without any great fear of droughts, it being certain that better streams are not to be
            found in any part of the world. The sea-coasts and shores are also very pleasant, unto
            which the tortoises resort in huge numbers, there to lay their eggs. This island was
            formerly very well peopled on the North side thereof with many towns and villages ; but
            these, being ruined by the Hollanders, were at last for the greatest part deserted by
            the Spaniards. CHAPTER IV Of the Fruits, Trees, and Animals that are found at Hispaniola
            The spacious fields of this island do commonly extend them- s:5lves to the length of
            five or six leagues, the beauty whereof is so pleasing to the eye that, together with
            the great variety of their natural productions, they infinitely applaud and captivate
            the senses of the contemplator. For here at once they not only, with diversity of
            objects, recreate the sight, but, with many of the same, also do please the smell, and,
            with most, contribute abundance of delights to the taste. With sundry diversities also
            they flatter and excite the appetite ; but more especially with the multitude of oranges
            and lemons, here growing both sweet and sour, and those that participate of both tastes
            and are only pleasantly tart. Besides which, here abundantly grow several other sorts of
            the same fruit, such as are called citrons, toronjas, and limes, in English not
            improperly called crab-lemons. True it is that, as to the lemons, they exceed not here
            the bigness of a hen's egg, which smallness distinguishes them from those of Spain most
            frequently used in these our Northern countries. The date- trees, which here are seen to
            cover the whole extent of very spacious plains, are exceedingly tall in their
            proportion, which notwithstanding does not offend but rather delight the view. Their
            height is observed to be from 150 to 200 feet, being wholly destitute of branches unto
            the very tops. Here it is there grows a certain pleasant white substance not unlike unto
            that of white cabbage, whence the branches and leaves do sprout, and in which also the
            seed or dates are contained. Every month one of those branches falls to the ground, and
            at the same time another sprouts out. But the seed ripens not but once in the year. The
            dates are food extremely coveted by the hedgehogs. The white substance growing 27 28
            TREES OF HISPANIOLA at the top of the tree is used by the Spaniards after the same
            manner for common sustenance as cabbage in Europe, they cutting it into sHces, and
            boiUng it in their ollas^, with all sorts of meat. The leaves of this sort of date-tree
            are seven or eight foot in length and three or four in breadth, being very fit to cover
            houses with. For they defend from rain equally with the best tiles, though never so
            rudely huddled together. They make use of them also to wrap up smoked flesh with, and to
            make a certain sort of buckets wherewith to carry water, though no longer durable than
            the space of six, seven, or eight days. The cabbages of these trees, for so we may call
            them, are of a greenish colour on the outside, though inwardly very white, whence may be
            separated a sort of rind, which is very like unto parchment, being fit to write upon as
            we do upon paper. The bodies of these trees are of an huge bulk or thickness, which two
            men can hardly compass with their arms. And yet they cannot properly be termed woody,
            but only three or four inches deep in thickness, all the rest of the internal part being
            very soft, insomuch that, paring off those three or four inches of woody substance, the
            remaining part of the body may be sliced hke new cheese. They wound them three or four
            foot above the root, and, making an incision or broach in the body, thence gently
            distils a sort of liquor, which in short time by fermentation becomes as strong as the
            richest wine, and which does easily inebriate if not used with modera- tion. The French
            call this sort of palm-trees ' frank-palms,' and they only grow, both here and
            elsewhere, in saltish grounds. Besides these palm-trees of which we have made mention,
            there are also in Hispaniola four other species of palms, which are distinguished by the
            names of latanier, palma espinosa or prickle-palm, palma a chapelet or rosary-palm,
            palma vinosa or wine-palm. The latanier-palm is not so tall as the wine- palm, although
            it has almost the same shape, only that the leaves are very like unto the fans our women
            use. They grow mostly in gravelly and sandy ground, their circumference being of seven
            foot more or less. The body has many prickles or ^ A Spanish word, meaning a round
            earthen pot, a dish compounded of various kinds of meat and vegetables. Cf. Howell,
            Letters [1630], V, 38 : " He can marinat [marinade = pickle] fish, make gellies . . .
            besides, he is passing good for an ollia." k I TREES OF HISPANIOLA 29 thorns of the
            length of half a foot, very sharp and pungent. It produces its seed after the same
            manner as that above- mentioned, which likewise serves for food unto the wild beasts.
            Another sort of these palm-trees is called prickle-palm, as we said before, by reason it
            is infinitely full of prickles, from the root to the very leaves thereof, much more than
            the precedent. With these prickles some of the barbarous Indians use to torment their
            prisoners of war whom they take in battle. They tie them to a tree, and then, taking
            these thorns, they put them into little pellets of cotton, which they dip in oil, and
            thus stick them in the sides of the miserable prisoners, as thick as the bristles of a
            hedgehog ; which of necessity cause an incredible torment to the patient. Afterwards
            they set them on fire, and, if the tormented prisoner sings in the midst of his torments
            and flames, he is esteemed as a valiant and courageous soldier who neither fears his
            enemies nor their torments. But if, on the contrary he cries out, they esteem him but as
            a poltroon or coward and unworthy of any memory. This custom was told me by an Indian,
            who said he had used his enemies thus oftentimes. The Hke cruelties to these many
            Christians have seen while they lived among those barbarians. But returning unto the
            prickle-palm, I shall only tell you that this palm-tree is in this only different from
            the latanier, that the leaves are like unto those of the frank-palm. Its seed is like
            unto that of the other palm-trees, being only much bigger and rounder, almost as a
            farthing, and inwardly full of little kernels, which are as pleasing to the taste as our
            walnuts in Europe. This tree grows for the most part in the marshes and low grounds of
            the sea-coast. The wine-palm is so called from the abundance of wine which is gathered
            from it. This palm grows in high and rocky mountains, not exceeding in tallness the
            height of 40 or 50 foot, but yet of an extraordinary shape or form. For, from the root
            unto the half of its proportion, it is only three or four inches thick. But, upwards,
            something above the two-thirds of its height, it is as big and as thick as an ordinary
            bucket or milk-pail. Within, it is full of a certain matter very like unto the tender
            stalk of a white cabbage, which is very juicy of a liquor that is much pleasing to the
            palate. This liquor after fermentation and settling of the grounds reduces itself into
            30 TREES OF HISPANIOLA a very good and clear wine, which is purchased^ with no great
            industry. For, having wounded the tree with an ordinary hatchet, they make a square
            incision or orifice in it, through which they bruise the said matter until it be capable
            of being squeezed out, or expressed with the hands, they needing no other instrument
            than this. With the leaves they make certain vessels, not only to settle and purify the
            afore- mentioned liquor, but also to drink in. It bears its fruit like other palms, but
            of a very small shape, being not unlike cherries. The taste hereof is very good, but of
            dangerous consequence unto the throat, where it causes huge and extreme pains, that
            produce malignant quinsies in them that eat it. The palma d, chapelet, or rosary-palm,
            was thus called both by the French and Spaniards because its seed is very fit to make
            rosaries or beads to say prayers upon, the beads being small, hard, and capable of being
            easily bored for that use. This fourth species grows on the tops of the highest
            mountains, and is of an excessive tallness, but withal very straight and adorned with
            very few leaves. Here grows also in this island a certain sort of apricot-trees, whose
            fruit equals in bigness that of our ordinary melons. The colour is like unto ashes, and
            the taste the very same as that of our apricots in Europe, the inward stones of this
            fruit being of the bigness of a hen's Q,gg. On these the wild-boars feed very
            deliciously, and fatten even to admiration. The trees called caremites are very like
            unto our pear-trees, whose fruits resemble much our Damascene plums or pruants^ of
            Europe, being of a very pleasant and agreeable taste and almost as sweet as milk. This
            fruit is black on the inside, and the kernels thereof, sometimes only two in number,
            sometimes three, others five, of the bigness of a lupin. This plum affords no less
            pleasant food to the wild-boars than the apricots above-mentioned, only that it is not
            so commonly to be found upon the island, nor in such quantity as those are. The
            genipa-trees are seen everywhere all over this island, being very like unto our
            cherry-trees, although its branches are more dilated. The fruit hereof is of an
            ash-colour, of the bigness of two fists, which interiorly is full of many * See note on
            p. 67. 2 Prunes : cf. Elyot. Castel of Helthe [1533], Bk. ii, p. 27 : " The damask prune

            HISPANIOLA 31 prickles or points that are involved under a thin membrane or skin, the
            which, if not taken away at the time of eating, causes great obstructions and gripings
            of the belly. Before this fruit grows ripe, if pressed, it affords a juice as black as
            ink, being fit to write withal upon paper. But the letters disappear within the space of
            nine days, the paper remaining as white as if it never had been written upon. The wood
            of this tree is very strong, solid, and hard, good to build ships withal, seeing it is
            observed to last many years in the water without putrefaction. Besides these, divers
            other sorts of trees are natives of this delicious island, that produce very excellent
            and pleasant fruits. Of these I shall omit to name several, knowing there are entire
            volumes of learned authors that have both described and searched them with greater
            attention and curiosity than my own. Notwithstanding, I shall continue to make mention
            of some few more in particular. Such are the cedars, which trees this part of the world
            produces in prodigious quantity. The French nation calls them acajou^ ; and they find
            them very useful for the building of ships and canoes. These canoes are like little
            wherry-boats, being made of one tree only, excavated, and fitted for the sea. They are
            withal so swift as for that very property they may be called ' Neptune's post-horses*.
            The Indians make these canoes without the use of any iron instruments, by only burning
            the trees at the bottom nigh the root, and afterwards governing the fire with such
            industry as nothing is burnt more than what they would have. Some of them have hatchets
            made of flint, wherewith they scrape, or pare off, whatsoever was burnt too far. And
            thus, by the sole instrument of fire, they know how to give them that shape which
            renders them capable of navigating threescore or fourscore leagues with ordinary
            security. As to medicinal productions, here is to be found the tree that affords the gum
            elemi used in our apothecaries' shops. Likewise guaiacum, or lignum sanctum ; lignum
            aloes, or aloe- wood ; cassia lignea ; China-roots^ ; with several others. The * The

            great abundance ; as doth Radix Chines, or China-root." — Description of the Isthmus of
            Darien [1699], p. 4. 32 TREES OF HISPANIOLA tree called mapou, besides that it is
            medicinal, is also used for making of canoes, as being very thick ; yet is it much
            inferior to the acajou or cedar, as being somewhat spongy, whereby it sucks in much
            water, which renders it dangerous in navigation. The tree called acoma has its wood very
            hard and heavy, of the colour of palm. These qualities render it very fit to make oars
            for the sugar-mills. Here are also in great quantities hrasileie, or brazil-wood, and
            that which the Spaniards call mariQanilla. Brazil-wood is now very well known in the
            provinces of Holland and the Low Countries. By another name it is called by the
            Spaniards lenna de peje palo. It serves only, or chiefly, for dyeing and what belongs to
            that trade. It grows abun- dantly along the sea-coasts of this island, especially in two
            places called Jacmel and Jaquina. These are two com- modious ports or bays, capable of
            receiving ships of the greatest bulk. The tree called mafiQanilla, or dwarf apple-tree,
            grows nigh unto the sea-shore, being naturally so low that its branches, though never so
            short, always touch the water. It bears a fruit something like unto our sweet-scented
            apples which, notwithstanding, is of a very venomous quality. For, these apples being
            eaten by any person, he instantly changes colour, and such an huge thirst seizes him as
            all the water of the Thames cannot extinguish, he dying raving mad within a little while
            after. But, what is more, the fish that eat, as it often happens, of this fruit are also
            poisonous. This tree affords also a liquor, both thick and white, like unto the
            fig-tree, which, if touched by the hand, raises bhsters upon the skin, and these are so
            red in colour as if it had been deeply scalded with hot water. One day being hugely
            tormented with mosquitos, or gnats, and as yet unacquainted with the nature of this
            tree, I cut a branch thereof, to serve me instead of a fan, but all my face swelled the
            next day and filled with bhsters, as if it were burnt to such a degree that I was blind
            for three days. Ycao is the name of another sort of tree, so called by the Spaniards,
            which grows by the sides of rivers. This bears a certain fruit, not unhke unto our
            bullace or damson-plums. And this food is extremely coveted by the wild-boar, when at
            its perfect maturity ; with which they fatten as much as our TREES OF HISPANIOLA 33 hogs
            with the sweetest acorns of Spain. These trees love sandy ground, yet are so low that,
            their branches being very large, they take up a great circumference, almost couched upon
            the ground. The trees named abelcoses bear fruit of like colour with the ycaos
            above-mentioned, but of the bigness of melons, the seeds or kernels being as big as
            eggs. The substance of this fruit is yellow, and of a pleasant taste ; which the poorest
            among the French do eat instead of bread, the wild-boar not caring at all for this
            fruit. These trees grow very tall and thick, being somewhat like unto our largest sort
            of pear-trees. As to the insects which this island produces, I shall only take notice of
            three sorts of flies, which excessively torment ay human bodies, but more especially
            such as never before, or but a little while, were acquainted with these countries. The
            first sort of these flies is as big as our common horse-flies in Europe. And these,
            darting themselves upon men's bodies, there stick and suck their blood till they can no
            longer fly. Their importunity obliges to make almost continual use of branches of trees
            wherewith to fan them away. The Spaniards in those parts call them mosquitos^ or gnats,
            but the French give them the name of maranguines. The second sort of these insects is no
            bigger than a grain of sand. These make no buzzing noise, as the preceding species does,
            for which reason it is less avoidable, as being able also through its smallness to
            penetrate the finest linen or cloth. The hunters are forced to anoint their faces with
            hog's-grease, thereby to defend them- selves from the stings of these little animals. By
            night, in their huts or cottages, they constantly for the same purpose burn the leaves
            of tobacco, without which smoke they were not able to rest. True it is that in the
            daytime they are not very troublesome, in case any wind be stirring, for this, though
            never so little, causes them to dissipate. The gnats of the third species exceed not the
            bigness of a grain of mustard. The colour is red*. These sting not at all, but do bite
            so sharply upon the flesh as to create little ulcers therein. Whence it often comes that
            the face swells and is rendered hideous to the view, through this inconvenience. These
            are * Bosman, in his Guinea [transl. 1705], refers to " the innumerable millions of
            gnats, which the Portuguese call musquito's " — Letter xxi. * The bete rouge, to this
            day a pest in the West Indies. 34 INSECTS OF HISPANIOLA chiefly troublesome by day, even
            from the beginning of the morning until sun-setting, after which time they take up their
            rest, and permit human bodies to do the same. The Spaniards gave these insects the name
            of rojados, and the French that of calarodes. The insects which the Spaniards call
            cochinillas, and the English glow-worms, are also to be found in these parts. These are
            very like unto such as we have in Europe, unless that they are somewhat bigger and
            longer than ours. They have two little specks on their heads, which by night give so
            much light that three or four of those animals, being together upon a tree, it is not
            discernible at a distance from a bright shining fire. I had on a certain time at once
            three of these cochinillas in my cottage, which there continued until past midnight,
            shining so brightly that without any other light 'I could easily read in any book,
            although of never so small a print. I attempted to bring some of these insects into
            Europe when I came from those parts, but as soon as they came into a colder climate they
            died by the way. They lost also their shining upon the change of air, even before their
            death. This shining is so great, according to what I have related, that the Spaniards
            with great reason may well call them from their luminous quality moscas de fuego, that
            is to say fire-flies. There be also in Hispaniola an excessive number of grillones or
            crickets. These are of an extraordinary magnitude, if compared to ours, and so full of
            noise that they are ready to burst themselves with singing, if any person comes near
            them. Here is no lesser number of reptiles, such as serpents are and others, but by a
            particular providence of the Creator these have no poison. Neither do they any other
            harm than unto what fowl they can catch, but more especially unto pullets, pigeons, and
            others of this kind. Ofttimes these serpents or snakes are useful in houses to cleanse
            them of rats and mice. For with great cunning they counterfeit their shrieks, and hereby
            both deceive and catch them at their pleasure. Hav- ing taken them, they in no wise eat
            the guts of these vermin, but only suck their blood at first. Afterwards throwing away
            the guts, they swallow almost entire the rest of the body, which, as it should seem,
            they readily digest into soft excre- ments, of which they discharge their bellies.
            Another sort of reptiles belonging to this island is called by the name of REPTILES;
            SPIDERS; SCORPIONS 35 tcoQodores de tnoscas, or fly-catchers. This name was given unto
            this reptile by the Spaniards, by reason they never could experience it lived upon any
            other food than flies. Hence it cannot be said this creature causes any harm unto the
            inhabit- ants, but rather benefit, seeing it consumes by its continual exercise of
            hunting the vexatious and troublesome flies. Land-tortoises here be also in great
            quantities. They mostly breed in mud and fields that are overflown with water. The
            inhabitants eat them, and testify they are very good food. But a sort of spider which is
            here found is very hideous. These are as big as an ordinary egg, and their feet as long
            as those of the biggest sea-crabs. Withal, they are very hairy, and have four black
            teeth, like unto those of a rabbit, both in bigness d shape. Notwithstanding, their
            bitings are not venomous, though they can bite very sharply, and do use it very com-
            only. They breed for the most part in the roofs of houses. This island also is not free
            from the insect called in Latin millepes, and in Greek scolopendria, or ' many-feet ' :
            neither is it void of scorpions. Yet, by the providence of nature, neither the one nor
            the other bears the least suspicion of poison. For, although they cease not to bite, yet
            their wounds require not the appHcation of any medicament for their cure. And, although
            their bitings cause some inflam- mation and swelling at the beginning, however these
            symptoms disappear of their own accord. Thus in the whole circum- ference of Hispaniola,
            no animal is found that produces the least harm with its venom. After the insects
            above-mentioned, I shall not omit to say something of that terrible beast called cayman.
            This is a certain species of crocodile, wherewith this island very plenti- fully
            abounds. Among these caymans some are found to be of a corpulency very horrible to the
            sight. Certain it is, that such have been seen as had no less than three-score-and-ten
            foot in length and twelve in breadth. Yet more marvellous than their bulk is their
            cunning and subtlety wherewith they purchase their food. Being hungry, they place
            themselves nigh the sides of rivers, more especially at the fords, where cattle come to
            drink or wade over. Here they lie without any motion, nor stirring any part of their
            body, resembling an old tree fallen into the river, only floating upon the waters,
            whither these will carry them. Yet they recede not far from the bank- 36 CROCODILES OF
            HISPANIOLA sides, but continually lurk in the same place, waiting till some wild-boar or
            salvage cow comes to drink or refresh themselves at that place. At which point of time,
            with huge activity, they assault them, and seizing on them with no less fierceness, they
            drag the prey into the water and there stifle it. But what is more worthy admiration is,
            that three or four days before the caymans go upon this design, they eat nothing at all.
            But, diving into the river, they swallow one or two hundred- weight of stones, such as
            they can find. With these they render themselves more heavy than before, and make
            addition to their natural strength (which in this animal is very great), thereby to
            render their assault the more terrible and secure. The prey being thus stifled, they
            suffer it to lie four or five days underwater untouched ; for they could not eat the
            least bit thereof, unless half-rotten. But, when it is arrived at such a degree of
            putrefaction as is most pleasing to their palate, they devour it with great appetite and
            voracity. If they can lay hold on any hides of beasts, such as the inhabitants ofttimes
            place in the fields for drying against the sun, they drag them into the water. Here they
            leave them for some days, well loaden with stones, till the hair falls off. Then they
            eat them with no less appetite than they would the animals themselves, could they catch
            them. I have seen myself, many times, like things unto these I have related. But,
            besides my own experience, many writers of natural things have made entire treatises of
            these animals, describing not only their shape, magnitude, and other qualities, but also
            their voracity and brutish inclinations ; which, as I have told you, are very strange. A
            certain person of good reputation and credit told me that one day he was by the
            river-side washing his baraca, or tent, wherein he used to lie in the fields. As soon as
            he began his work, a cayman fastened upon the tent, and with incredible fury dragged it
            under water. The man, desirous to see if he could save his tent, pulled on the contrary
            side with all his strength, having in his mouth a butcher's knife (where- with as it
            happened he was scraping the canvas) to defend himself in case of urgent necessity. The
            cayman, being angry at this opposition, vaulted upon his body, out of the river, and
            drew him with great celerity into the water, endeavouring with the weight of his bulk to
            stifle him under the banks. Thus finding himself in the greatest extremity, almost
            crushed to CROCODILES OF HISPANIOLA 37 death by that huge and formidable animal, with
            his knife he gave the cayman several wounds in the belly, wherewith he suddenly expired.
            Being thus delivered from the hands of imminent fate, he drew the cayman out of the
            water, and with the same knife opened the body, to satisfy his own curiosity. In his
            stomach he found nearly one hundred- weight of stones, each of them being almost of the
            bigness of his fist. The caymans are ordinarily busied in hunting and catching of flies,
            which they eagerly devour. The occasion is, because close unto their skin they have
            certain little scales which smell with a sweet scent, something like unto musk. This
            aromatic odour is coveted by the flies, and here they come to repose themselves and
            sting. Thus they both persecute each other continually, with an incredible hatred and
            antipathy. Their manner of procreating and hatching their young ones is as follows. They
            approach the sandy banks of some river that lies exposed to the rays of the south sun.
            Among these sands they lay their eggs, which afterwards they cover with their feet ; and
            here they find them hatched, and with young genera- tion, by only the heat of the sun.
            These, as soon as they are out of the shell, by natural instinct run unto the water.
            Many times those eggs are destroyed by birds that find them out, as they scrape among
            the sands. Hereupon the females of the caymans, at such times as they fear the coming of
            any flocks of birds, do ofttimes by night swallow these their eggs, and keep them in
            their stomach till the danger is over. And, from time to time, they bury them again in
            the sand, as I have told you, bringing them forth again out of their belly till the
            season is come of being excluded the shell. At this time, if the mother be nigh at hand,
            they run unto her and play with her as little whelps would do with their dams, sporting
            them- selves according to their own custom. In this sort of sport they will oftentimes
            run in and out of their mother's belly, even as rabbits into their holes. This I have
            seen them do many times, as I have spied them at play with their dam over the water upon
            the contrary banks of some river. At which time I have often disturbed their sport by
            throwing a stone that way, causing them on a sudden to creep into the mother's bowels,
            for fear of some imminent danger. The manner of procreating of those p,nimals is always
            the same as I have re- 38 CROCODILES OF HISPANIOLA lated, and at the same time of the
            year, for they neither meddle nor mate with one another but in the month of May. They
            give them in this country the name of crocodiles, though in other places of the West
            Indies they go under the name of caymans. CHAPTER V Of all sorts of quadruped animals
            and birds that are found in this island. As also a relation of the French Buccaneers
            Besides the fruits which this island produces, whose plenty, as is held for certain,
            surpasses all the islands of America, it abounds also very plentifully in all sorts of
            quadruped animals, such as horses, bulls, cows, wild-boars, and others very useful to
            human kind, not only for common sustenance of life, but also for cultivating the ground
            and the management of a sufficient commerce. In this island, therefore, are still
            remaining an huge number of wild-dogs. These destroy yearly multitudes of all sorts of
            cattle. For no sooner has a cow brought forth her calf, or a mare foaled, but these
            wild-mastiffs come to devour the young breed, if they find not some resistance from
            keepers and other domestic dogs. They run up and down the woods and fields commonly in
            whole troops of fifty, three-score, or more to- gether, being withal so fierce that they
            ofttimes will assault an entire herd of wild-boars, not ceasing to persecute them till
            they have at last overcome and torn in pieces two or three. One day a French Buccaneer
            caused me to see a strange action of this kind. Being in the fields hunting together, we
            heard a great noise of dogs, which had surrounded a wild-boar. Having tame dogs with us,
            we left them to the custody of our servants, desirous to see the sport, if possible.
            Hence my companion and I, each of us, climbed up into several trees, both for security
            and prospect. The wild-boar was all alone, and standing against a tree ; with his tusks
            he endeavoured to defend himself from a great number of dogs that had enclosed him,
            having with his teeth killed and wounded several of them. This bloody fight continued
            about an hour, the wild-boar meanwhile attempting many times to escape. At last, being
            39 40 WILD-DOGS OF HISPANIOLA upon the flight, one of those dogs, leaping on his back,
            fastened upon the testicles, which at one pull he tore in pieces. The rest of the dogs,
            perceiving the courage of their companion, fast- ened likewise upon the boar, and
            presently after killed him. This being done, all of them, the first only excepted, laid
            them- selves down upon the ground about the prey, and there peaceably continued till he,
            the first and most courageous of the troop, had eaten as much as he could devour. When
            this dog had ended his repast and left the dead beast, all the rest fell in to take
            their share, till nothing was left that they could devour. What ought we to infer from
            this notable action, performed by the brutish sense of wild animals ? Only this, that
            even beasts themselves are not destitute of knowledge, and that they give us documents
            how to honour such as have well deserved, seeing these, being irrational animals as they
            were, did reverence and respect him that exposed his life to the greatest danger, in
            vanquishing courageously the common enemy. The Governor of Tortuga, Monsieur Ogeron,
            understanding that the wild-dogs killed too many of the wild-boars, and that the hunters
            of that island had much-a-do to find any, fearing lest that common sustenance of the
            isle should fail, caused a great quantity of poison to be brought from France, therewith
            to destroy the wild-mastiffs. This was performed in the year 1668, by commanding certain
            horses to be killed and en- venomed, and laid open in the woods and fields, at certain
            places where mostly wild-dogs used to resort. This being continued for the space of six
            months, there were killed an incredible number in the said time. And yet all this
            industry was not sufficient to exterminate and destroy the race ; yea, scarce to make
            any diminution thereof, their number appear- ing to be almost as entire as before. These
            wild-dogs are easily rendered tame among people, even as tame as the ordinary dogs we
            breed in houses. Moreover, the hunters of those parts, whensoever they find a wild bitch
            with young whelps, do commonly take away the puppies and bring them to their houses,
            where they experience them, being grown up, to hunt much better than other dogs. 'But
            here the curious reader may peradventure inquire whence or by what accident came so many
            wild dogs into those islands. The occasion was that the Spaniards, having pos- WILD-DOGS
            OF HISPANIOLA 41 sessed themselves of these isles, found them much peopled with Indians.
            These were a barbarous sort of people totally given to sensuality and a brutish custom
            of life, hating all manner of labour, and only inclined to run from place to place,
            killing and making war against their neighbours, not out of any ambition to reign, but
            only because they agreed not with themselves in some common terms of language. Hence
            perceiving the dominion of the Spaniards laid a great restric- tion upon their lazy and
            brutish customs, they conceived an incredible odium against them, such as never was to
            be reconciUid. But more especially, because they saw them take possession of their
            kingdoms and dominions. Hereupon they made against them all the resistance they were
            capable of, opposing everywhere their designs to the utmost of their power, until that
            the Spaniards, finding themselves to be cruelly hated by those Indians, and nowhere
            secure from their treacheries, resolved to extirpate and ruin them every one ;
            especially seeing they could neither tame them by the civilities of their customs, nor
            conquer them by the sword. But the Indians, it being their ancient custom to make their
            woods their chieftest places of defence, at present made these their refuge whenever
            they fled from the Spaniards that pursued them. Hereupon those first conquerors of the
            New World made use of dogs to range and search the intricatest thickets of woods and
            forests for those their implacable and unconquerable enemies. By these means they forced
            them to leave their ancient refuge and submit unto the sword, seeing no milder usage
            would serve turn. Hereupon they killed some of them, and, quartering their bodies,
            placed them in the highways, to the intent that others might take warning from such a
            punishrhent, not to incur the like danger. But this severity proved to be of ill
            consequence. For, instead of frighting them and reducing their minds to a civil society,
            they conceived such horror of the Spaniards and their pro- ceedings, that they resolved
            to detest and fly their sight for ever. And hence the greatest part died in caves and
            subterraneous places of the woods and mountains ; in which places I myself have seen
            many times great numbers of human bones./ The Spaniards afterwards, finding no more
            Indians to appear about the woods, endeavoured to rid themselves of the great number of
            dogs they had in their houses, whence 42 WILD-BULLS OF HISPANIOLA these animals, finding
            no masters to keep them, betook themselves unto the woods and fields, there to hunt for
            food to preserve their lives. Thus by degrees they became un- acquainted with the houses
            of their ancient masters, and at last grew wild. This is the truest account I can give
            of the multitudes of wild-dogs which are seen to this day in these parts. But besides
            the wild-mastiffs above-mentioned, here are also huge numbers of wild-horses to be seen
            everywhere. These run up and down in whole herds or flocks all over the island of
            Hispaniola. They are but low of stature, short- bodied, with great heads, long necks,
            and big or thick legs. In a word, they have nothing that is handsome in all their shape.
            They are seen to run up and down commonly in troops of two or three hundred together,
            one of them going always before, to lead the multitude. When they meet any person that
            travels through the woods or fields, they stand still, suffering him to approach till he
            can almost touch them, and then, suddenly starting, they betake themselves to flight,
            running away disorderly, as fast as they are able. The hunters catch them with industry,
            only for the benefit of their skins, although sometimes they preserve their flesh
            likewise, which they harden with smoke, using it for provisions when they go to sea.
            Here would be also wild-bulls and cows, in greater number than at present, if by
            continuation of hunting their race were not much diminished. Yet considerable profit is
            made even to this day by such as make it their business to kill them. The wild-bulls are
            of a vast corpulency, or bigness of body ; and yet they do no hurt unto any person if
            they be not exasperated but left to their own repose. The hides which are taken from
            them are from eleven to thirteen foot long. The diversity of birds inhabiting the air of
            this island is so great that I should be troublesome, as well unto the reader as myself,
            if I should attempt to muster up their species. Hence, leaving aside the prolix
            catalogue of their multitude, I shall content myself only to mention some few of the
            chief est. Here is a certain species of pullets in the woods, which the Spaniards call
            by the name of pintadas, which the inhabitants find with- out any distinction to be as
            good as those which are bred in houses. It is already known to everybody that the
            parrots BIRDS OF HISPANIOLA 43 which we have in Europe are transported to us from these
            parts of the world. Whence may be inferred that, seeing such a number of these talkative
            birds are preserved among us, notwithstanding the diversity of climates, much greater
            multitudes are to be found where the air and temperament is natural to them. The parrots
            make their nests in holes of palmetto-trees, which holes are before made to their hand
            by other birds. The reason is, forasmuch as they are not capable of excavating any wood
            though never so soft, as having their own bills too crooked and blunt. Hence provident
            nature has supplied them with the labour and industry of another sort of small birds
            called carpinieros, or carpenters. These are no bigger than sparrows, yet
            notwithstanding of such hard and piercing bills that no iron instrument can be made more
            apt to excavate any tree, though never so solid and hard. In the holes, therefore,
            fabricated beforehand by these birds, the parrots get possession, and build their nests,
            as has been said. Pigeons of all sorts are also here abundantly provided unto the
            inhabitants by Him that created in the beginning and provided all things. For eating of
            them, those of this island observe the same seasons as we said before, speaking of the
            isle of Tortuga. Betwixt the pigeons of both islands little or no difference is
            observable, only that these of Hispaniola are something fatter and bigger than those.
            Another sort of small birds here are called cabreros, or goat-keepers. These are very
            like unto others called heronsetas, and do chiefly feed upon crabs of the sea. In these
            birds are found seven distinct bladders of gall, and hence their flesh is as bitter unto
            the taste as aloes. Crows or ravens, more troublesome unto the inhabitants than useful,
            do here make a hideous noise through the whole circumference of the island. Their
            ordinary food is the flesh of wild-dogs, or the carcases of those beasts the Buccaneers
            kill and throw away. These clamorous birds do no sooner hear the report of a
            fowling-piece or musket but they gather from all sides into whole flocks, and fill the
            air and woods with their unpleasant notes. They are in nothing different from those we
            see in Europe. / It is now high time to speak of the French nation, who inhabit a great
            part of this island. We have told, at the beginning of this book, after what manner they
            came at first into these parts. At present, therefore, we shall only describe 44 HUNTERS
            their manner of living, customs, and ordinary employments. The different callings or
            professions they follow are generally but three : either to hunt, or plant, or else to
            rove on the sea in quahty of pirates. It is a general and solemn custom amongst them all
            to seek out for a comrade or companion, whom we may call partner, in their fortunes ;
            with whom they join the whole stock of what they possess, towards a mutual and
            reciprocal gain. This is done also by articles drawn and signed on both sides, according
            to what has been agreed be- tween them. Some of these constitute their surviving com-
            panion absolute heir unto what is left by the death of the first of the two. Others, if
            they be married, leave their estates unto their wives and children ; others unto other
            relations. This being done, every one applies himself unto his calling, which is always
            one of the three aforementioned. The hunters are again subdivided into two several
            sorts. For some of these are given to hunt only wild-bulls and cows ; others hunt only
            wild-boars. The first of these two sorts of hunters are called Buccaneers^ These not
            long ago were about the number of 600 upon this island ; but at present there are not
            reckoned to be above 300 more or less. The cause has been the great decrease of
            wild-cattle through the dominions of the French in Hispaniola, which has appeared to be
            so notable that, far from getting any considerable gain, they at present are but poor in
            this exercise. Avhen the Buccaneers go into the woods to hunt for wild-bulls and cows,
            they commonly remain there the space of a whole twelve- month or two years, without
            returning home. After the hunt is over and the spoil divided among them, they commonly
            sail to the isle of Tortuga, there to provide themselves with guns, powder, bullets, and
            small shot, with all other necessaries against another going out or hunting. The rest of
            their gains they spend with great liberality, giving themselves freely to all manner of
            vices and debauchery, > among which the first is that of drunkenness, which they
            exercise for the most part with brandy ; this they drink as liberally as the Spaniards
            do clear fountain-water. Sometimes they buy together a pipe of wine : this they stave at
            the one end, and never cease drinking till they have made an end of it. Thus they
            celebrate the festivals of Bacchus so long as they have any money left. Neither do they
            forget at the same time HUNTERS 45 the goddess Venus, for whose beastly deHghts they
            find more women than they can make use of. For all the tavern-keepers and strumpets wait
            for the coming of these lewd Buccaneers, even after the same manner that they do at
            Amsterdam for the arrival of the East India fleet at the Texel. The said Buccaneers are
            hugely cruel and tyrannical towards their servants : insomuch that commonly these had
            rather be galley-slaves in the Straits, or saw brazil-wood in the rasp- houses^ of
            Holland, than serve such barbarous masters. ^The second sort of hunters hunt nothing
            else but wild-boars. The flesh of these they salt, and, being thus preserved from
            corruption, they sell it unto the planters. These hunters have also the same vicious
            customs of life, and are as much addicted to all manner of debauchery as the former. But
            their manner of hunting is quite different from what is practised in Europe. For these
            Buccaneers have certain places, designed for hunting, where they live for the space of
            three or four months, and sometimes, though not often, a whole year. Such places are
            called deza boulan ; and in these, with only the company of five or six friends, who go
            along with them, they continue all the time above-mentioned in mutual friendship. The
            first Buccaneers we spoke of many times make an agreement with certain planters to
            furnish them with meat all the whole year at a certain price. The payment hereof is
            often made with two or three hundred-weight of tobacco, in the leaf. But the planters
            commonly into the bargain furnish them likewise with a servant, whom they send to help.
            Unto the servant they afford a sufficient quantity of all necessaries for that purpose,
            especially of powder, bullets, and small shot, to hunt withal ^ ^The planters began to
            cultivate and plant the isle of Tortuga in the year 1598. The first plantation was of
            tobacco, the which grew to admiration, being Hkewise of very good quality.
            Notwithstanding, by reason of the small circumference of the island, they were then able
            to plant but little ; especially there being many pieces of land in that isle that were
            not fit to produce tobacco. They attempted likewise to make sugar, but, by reason of the
            great expenses necessary to defray the ^ Houses of correction, at one time in use in
            Holland and Germany. Prisoners were put to rasping wood. Cf. Evelyn, Diary, 19 Aug. 1641
            : " We went to see the ra^p-house, where lusty knaves are compell'd to worke, and the
            rasping of brasill and logwood is very hard labour." 46 BEANS; POTATOES charges, they
            could not bring it to any effect. So that the greatest part of the inhabitants, as we
            said before, betook themselves to the exercise of hunting, and the remaining part to
            that of piracy. At last the hunters, finding themselves scarce able to subsist by their
            first profession, began likewise to seek out lands that might be rendered fit for
            culture ; and in these also they planted tobacco. •The first land that they chose for
            this purpose was Cul de Sac, whose territory extends towards the Southern part of the
            island. This piece of ground they divided into several quarters, which were called the
            Great Amea, Niep, Rochelois, the Little Grave, the Great Grave, and the Augame. TIere,
            by little and little, they increased so much that at present there are above two
            thousand planters in those fields. At the beginning they endured very much hardship,
            seeing that, while they were busied about their husbandry, they could not go out of the
            island to seek pro- visions. This hardship was also increased by the necessity of
            grubbing, cutting down, burning, and digging, whereby to extirpate the innumerable roots
            of shrubs and trees./ For when the French possessed themselves of that island, it was
            wholly overgrown with woods extremely thick, these being inhabited only by an
            extraordinary number of wild-boars. The method they took to clear the ground was to
            divide them- selves into small companies of two or three persons together, and these
            companies to separate far enough from each other, provided with a few hatchets and some
            quantity of coarse provision. With these things they used to go into the woods, and
            there to build huts for their habitation, of only a few rafters and boughs of trees.
            Their first endeavour was to root up the shrubs and little trees ; afterwards to cut
            down the great ones. These they gathered into heaps, with their branches, and then set
            them on fire, excepting the roots, which, last of all, they were constrained to grub and
            dig up after the best manner they could. The first seed they committed to the ground was
            beans. These in those countries both ripen and dry away in the space of six weeks. The
            second fruit necessary to human life which here they tried was potatoes. These come not
            to perfection in lesser time than four or five months. On these they most commonly make
            their breakfasts every morning. They dress them no otherwise than by boiling them in a
            kettle with fair water. CASSAVA; VEYCOU; BANANAS 47 Afterwards they cover them with a
            cloth for the space of half- an-hoiir, by which manner of dressing they become as soft
            as boiled chestnuts. Of the said potatoes also they make a drink called maiz. They cut
            them into small slices, and cover them with hot water. When they are well imbibed with
            water, they press them through a coarse cloth, and the liquor that comes out, although
            somewhat thick, they keep in vessels made for that purpose. Here, after settling two or
            three days, it begins to work ; and, having thrown off its lees, is fit for drink. They
            use it with great delight, apd although the taste is somewhat sour, yet it is very
            pleasant, substantial, and wholesome. The industry of this composition is owing unto the
            Indians, as well as of many others, which the ingeni- osity of those barbarians caused
            them to invent both for the preservation and the pleasure of their own life. The third
            fruit the newly cultivated land afforded was mandioca, which the Indians by another name
            call castava. This is a certain root which they plant, but comes not to per- fection
            till after eight or nine months, yea, sometimes a whole year. Being thoroughly ripe, it
            may be left in the ground the space of eleven or twelve months, without the least
            suspicion of corruption. But, this time being past, the said roots must be converted
            unto use some way or another, otherwise they conceive a total putrefaction. Of these
            roots of cassava, in those countries, ^s made a sort of granulous flour, or meal,
            extremely dry and white, which supplies the want of common bread made of wheat, whereof
            the fields are altogether barren in that island. For this purpose they have in their
            houses certain graters made either of copper or tin, wherewith they grate the
            aforementioned roots, just as they use to do mirick in Holland. By the by, let me tell
            you, mirick is a certain root of a very biting taste, not unlike unto strong mustard,
            wherewith they usually make sauces for some sorts of fish. When they have grated as much
            cassava root as will serve turn, they put the gratings into bags, or sacks, made of
            coarse linen, and press out all the moisture, until they remain very dry. Afterwards
            they pass the gratings through a sieve, leaving them, after sifting, very like unto
            sawdust. The meal being thus prepared, they lay it upon planches of iron, which are made
            very hot, upon which it is converted into a sort of cakes, very thin. These cakes are
            afterwards placed in the 48 MANNER OF PLANTING TOBACCO sun, upon the tops of houses,
            where they are thoroughly and perfectly dried. And lest they should lose any part of
            their meal, what did not pass the sieve is made into up rolls, 5 or 6 inches thick.
            These are placed one upon another, and left in this posture until they begin to corrupt.
            Of this corrupted matter they make a liquor, by them called veycou, which they find very
            excellent, and certainly is not inferior unto our English beer. Bananas are likewise
            another sort of fruit, of which is made another excellent liquor, which, both in
            strength and pleasant- ness of taste, may be compared unto the best wines of Spain. But
            this liquor of bananas, as it easily causes drunkenness in such as use it immoderately,
            so it likewise very frequently inflames the throat, and produces dangerous diseases in
            that part. Guines agudos is also another fruit whereof they make drink. But this sort of
            liquor is not so strong as the preceding. Howbeit, both the one and the other are
            frequently mingled with water, thereby to quench thirst. After they had cultivated these
            plantations, and filled them with all sorts of roots and fruits necessary for human
            life, they began to plant tobacco, for trading. The manner of planting this frequent
            commodity is as follows. They make certain beds of earth in the field, no larger than
            twelve-foot square. These beds they cover very well with palmetto-leaves, to the intent
            that the rays of the sun may not touch the earth where- in tobacco is sowed. They water
            them likewise, when it does not rain, as we do our gardens in Europe. When it is grown
            about the bigness of young lettuce, they transplant it into straight lines, which they
            make in other spacious fields, setting every plant at the distance of 3 foot from each
            other. They observe, likewise, the fittest seasons of the year for these things, which
            are commonly from January until the end of March, these being the months wherein most
            rains do fall in those countries. Tobacco ought to be weeded very carefully, seeing the
            least root of any other herb, coming near it, is sufficient to hinder its growth. When
            it is grown to the height of one foot and a half or thereabouts, they cut off the tops —
            thereby to hinder the stalks and leaves from shooting too high upwards, to the intent
            that the whole plant may receive greater strength from the earth, which affords unto it
            all its vigour and taste. While it ripens and comes to full SUBJECTION OF THE PLANTERS
            49 perfection, they prepare in their houses certain apartments of fifty or three-score
            foot in length and thirty or forty in breadth. These they fill with branches of trees
            and rafters, and upon them lay the green tobacco to dry. ^When it is thoroughly dried,
            they strip off the leaf from the stalks, and cause it to be rolled up by certain people
            who are employed in this work and no other. >. Unto these they afford for their labour
            the tenth part of what they make up into rolls. This property is peculiar unto tobacco,
            which therefore I shall not omit, that if, while it is yet in the ground, the leaf be
            pulled off from the stalk, it sprouts again, no less than four times in one year. Here I
            should be glad to give an account also of the manner of making sugar, indigo and gimbes^
            ; but, seeing these things are not planted in those parts whereof we now speak, I have
            thought fit to pass them over in silence. ^The French planters of the isle of Hispaniola
            have always unto this present time been subject unto the Governors of Tortuga. Yet this
            obedience has not been rendered without much reluctance and grudging on their side. In
            the year 1664 the West India Company of France laid the foundations of a colony in
            Tortuga, under which colony the planters of Hispaniola were comprehended and named as
            subjects thereunto. This decree disgusted the said planters very much, they taking it
            very ill to be reputed subjects unto a private Company of men who had no authority to
            make them so ; especially being in a country which belonged not unto the dominions of
            the King of France. Hereupon they resolved to work no longer for the said Company. And
            this resolution of theirs was sufficient to compel the Company to a total dissolution of
            the Colony. But at last the Governor of Tortuga, who was pretty well stocked with
            planters, con- ceiving he could more easily force them than the West India Company,
            found an invention whereby to draw them unto his obedience. He promised them he would
            put off their several sorts of merchandize, and cause such returns to be made, in lieu
            of their goods from France, as they should best like. Withal, he dealt with the
            merchants under-hand, that all ships whatsoever should come consigned unto him, and no
            persons should entertain any correspondence with those planters of * Perhaps gambier,
            gantbir, an astringent extract from the leaves of Uncaria Gambit. 50 FIRST DUTCH TRADE
            Hispaniola ; thinking thereby to avoid many inconveniences, and compel them through
            necessity and want of all things to obey. By these means he not only obtained the
            obedience he designed from those people, but also that some merchants who had promised
            to deal with them and visit them now and then, no longer did it. Notwithstanding what
            has been said, in the year 1669 two ships from Holland happened to arrive at the isle of
            Hispaniola with all sorts of merchandize necessary in those parts. With these ships
            presently the planters aforesaid resolved to deal, and with the Dutch nation for the
            future, thinking hereby to withdraw their obedience from the Governor of Tortuga, and,
            by frustrating his designs, revenge themselves of what they had endured under his
            government. Not long after the arrival of the Hollanders, the Governor of Tortuga came
            to visit the plantation of Hispaniola, in a vessel very well armed. But the planters not
            only forbade him to come ashore, but with their guns also forced him to weigh anchor,
            and retire faster than he came. Thus the Hollanders began to trade with these people for
            all manner of things. But such relations and friends as the Governor had in Hispaniola
            used all the endeavours they were capable of to impede the commerce. This being
            understood by the planters, they sent them word that in case they laid not aside their
            artifices, for the hinder ance of the com- merce which was begun with the Hollanders,
            they should every one assuredly be torn in pieces. Moreover, to oblige farther the
            Hollanders and contemn the Governor and his party, they gave greater ladings unto the
            two ships than they could desire, with many gifts and presents unto the officers and
            mariners, whereby they sent them very well contented to their own country. The
            Hollanders came again very punctually, according to their promise, and found the
            planters under a greater indignation than before against the Governor ; either because
            of the great satisfaction they had already conceived of this commerce with the Dutch, or
            that by their means they hoped to subsist by themselves without any further dependence
            upon the French nation. However it was, suddenly after they set up another resolution
            something more strange than the preceding. The tenour hereof was that they would go unto
            the island of Tortuga, and cut the Governor in pieces. Here- upon they gathered together
            as many canoes as they could, PLAN TO KILL THE GOVERNOR 51 and set sail from Hispaniola,
            with design not only to kill the Governor, but also to possess themselves of the whole
            island. This they thought they could more easily perform by reason of all necessary
            assistance which they believed would at any time be sent them from Holland. By which
            means they were already determined in their minds to erect themselves into a new
            Commonwealth, independent of the Crown of France. But no sooner had they begun this
            great revolution of their little State, when they received news of a war declared
            between the two nations in Europe. This wrought such a consterna- tion in their minds as
            caused them to give over that enter- prize and retire without attempting anything. In
            the meanwhile the Governor of Tortuga sent into France for aid towards his own security
            and the reduction of those people to their former obedience. This was granted him, and
            two men-of-war were sent unto Tortuga, with orders to be at his commands. Having
            received such a considerable support, he sent them very well equipped to the isle of
            His- paniola. Being arrived at the place, they landed part of their forces, with a
            design to force the people to the obedience of those whom they much hated in their
            hearts. But the planters, seeing the arrival of those two frigates and not being
            ignorant of their design, fled into the woods, abandoning their houses and many of their
            goods, which they left behind. These were immediately rifled and burnt by the French
            without any compassion, not sparing the least cottage they found. Afterwards the
            Governor began to relent in his anger, and let them know by some messengers that in case
            they would return unto his obedience, he would give ear unto some accommodation betwixt
            them. Hereupon the planters, finding themselves destitute of all human relief and that
            they could expect no help from any side, surrendered unto the Governor upon articles,
            which were made and signed on both sides. But these were not too strictly observed, for
            he commanded two of the chief among them to be hanged. The residue were pardoned, and
            withal he gave them free leave to trade with any nation whatsoever they found most fit
            for their purpose. With the grant of this liberty they began to recultivate their plant-
            ations, which gave them an huge quantity of very good tobacco ; they selling yearly to
            the sum of 20 or 30 thousand rolls. ^ 52 CRUELTY OF A PLANTER /In this country tlie
            planters have but very few slaves, for want of which they themselves, and some servants
            they have, are constrained to do all the drudgery. These servants com- monly oblige and
            bind themselves unto their masters for the space of three years. But their masters,
            forsaking all con- science and justice, oftentimes traffic with their bodies as with
            horses at a fair ; selling them unto other masters, even just as they sell negroes
            brought from the coast of Guinea. Yea, to advance this trade, some persons there are who
            go purposely into France (the same happens in England and other coun- tries), and,
            travelling through the cities, towns, and villages, endeavour to pick up young men or
            boys, whom they trans- port, by making them great promises. These, being once allured
            and conveyed into the islands I speak of, they force to work like horses, the toil they
            impose upon them being much harder than what they usually enjoin unto the negroes, their
            slaves. For these they endeavour in some manner to pre- serve, as being their perpetual
            bond-men ; but, as for their white servants, they care not whether they live or die,
            seeing they are to continue no longer than three years in their service. ^ These
            miserable kidnapped people are frequently subject unto a certain disease, which in those
            parts is called coma, being a total privation of all their senses. And this distemper is
            judged to proceed from their hard usage, together with the change of their native
            climate into that which is directly opposite. Oftentimes it happens that, among these
            transported people, such are found as are persons of good quality and tender education.
            And these, being of a softer constitution, are more suddenly surprised with the disease
            above-mentioned, and with several others belonging to those countries, than those who
            have harder bodies and have been brought up to all manner of fatigue. Besides the hard
            usage they endure in their diet, apparel, and repose, many times they beat them so
            cruelly that some of them fall down dead under the hands of their cruel masters. This I
            have often seen with my own eyes, not without great grief and regret. Of many instances
            of this nature I shall give you only the following history, as being something more
            remarkable in its circumstances. It happened that a certain planter of those countries
            exercised such cruelty towards one of his servants as caused him to run away. Having
            absconded for some days in the TORTURE OF A SERVANT S3 woods from the fury of his
            tyrannical master, at last he was taken, and brought back to the dominion of this wicked
            Pharaoh. No sooner had he got him into his hands but he commanded him to be tied unto a
            tree. Here he gave him so many lashes upon his naked back as made his body run an entire
            stream of gore-blood, embruing therewith the ground about the tree. Afterwards, to make
            the smart of his wounds the greater, he anointed them with juice of lemon mingled with
            salt and pepper, being grounded small together. In this miserable posture he left him
            tied unto the tree for the space of four-and-twenty hours. These being past, he
            commenced his punishment again, lashing him as before, with so much cruelty that the
            miserable wretch, under this torture, gave up the ghost, with these dying words in his
            mouth : / beseech the Almighty God, Creator of heaven and earth, that he permit the
            wicked Spirit to make thee feel as many torments before thy death as thou hast caused me
            to feel before mine. A strange thing and worthy all astonishment and admiration ! Scarce
            three or four days were past after this horrible fact, when the Almighty Judge, who had
            heard the clamours of that tormented wretch, gave permission to the Author of Wickedness
            suddenly to possess the body of that barbarous and inhuman Amirricide^, who tormented
            him to death. Insomuch that those tyran- nical hands, wherewith he had punished to death
            his innocent servant, were the tormentors of his own body. For with them, after a
            miserable manner, he did beat himself and lacer- ated his own flesh, till he lost the
            very shape of man which nature had given him, not ceasing to howl and cry, without any
            rest either by day or night. Thus he continued to do until he died, in that condition of
            raving madness wherein he surrendered his ghost unto the same Spirit of Darkness who had
            tormented his body. Many other examples of this kind I could rehearse, but these, not
            belonging unto our present discourse, I shall therefore omit. The planters that inhabit
            the Caribbee Islands are rather worse and more cruel unto their servants than the
            preceding. In the Isle of Saint Christopher dwells one, whose name is Bettesa, very well
            known among the Dutch merchants, who ^ The allusion here seems to be irrecoverable.
            Research in all book-i of reference likely to yield a result, and inquiries of many
            classical and literary experts have proved quite futile. 54 PLANTERS' CRUELTIES has
            killed above a hundred of his servants with blows and stripes. -nThe English do the same
            with their servants. And the mildest cruelty they exercise towards them is that, when
            they have served six years of their time (the years they are bound for among the English
            being seven complete), they use them with such cruel hardship as forces them to beg of
            their masters to sell them unto others, although it be to begin an- other servitude of
            seven years, or at least three or four. I have known many who after this manner served
            fifteen and twenty years before they could obtain their freedom. /Another thing very
            rigorous among that nation is a law in those islands, whereby if any man owes to another
            above five -and-twenty shillings, English money, in case he cannot pay, he is liable to
            be sold for the space of six or eight months. I shall not trouble the patience of my
            reader any longer with relations of this kind, as belonging unto another subject
            different from what I have proposed to myself in this history. Whereupon I shall take my
            beginning hence to describe the famous actions and exploits of the greatest Pirates of
            my time, during my residence in those parts. These I shall endeavour to relate without
            the least note of passion or partiality ; yea, with that candour which is peculiar both
            to my mind and style : withal certifying my reader I shall give him no stories taken
            from others upon trust or hearsay, but only those enterprizes unto which I was myself an
            eye-witness. CHAPTER VI Of the origin of the most famous Pirates of the coasts of
            America. A notable exploit of Pierre le Grand I HAVE told you in the preceding chapters
            of this book after what manner I was compelled to adventure my life among the Pirates of
            America — unto which sort of men I think my- self obliged to give this name, for no
            other reason than that they are not maintained or upheld in their actions by any
            Sovereign Prince. For this is certain, that the Kings of Spain have upon several
            occasions sent by their Ambassadors to the Kings of France and England, complaining of
            the molestations and troubles those Pirates often caused upon the coasts of America,
            even in the calm of peace. Unto whose ambassadors it has always been answered : That
            such men did not commit those acts of hostility and piracy as subjects of their
            Majesties ; and therefore his Catholic Majesty might proceed against them accord- ing as
            he should find fit. The King of France, besides what has been said, added unto this
            answer : That he had no fort- ress nor castle upon the isle of Hispaniola ; neither did
            he receive one farthing of tribute thence. Moreover, the King of England adjoined : That
            he had never given any patents or commissions unto those of famaicafor committing any
            hostility against the sub- jects of his Catholic Majesty. Neither did he only give this
            bare answer, but also, out of his Royal desire to pleasure the Court of Spain, recalled
            the Governor of Jamaica, placing another in his room.^^11 this was not sufficient to
            prevent the Pirates of those parts from acting what mischief they could to the contrary.
            But, before I commence the relation of their bold and insolent actions, I shall say
            something of their origin and most common exercises, as also of the chiefest among them,
            and their manner of arming before they go out to sea. The first Pirate that was known
            upon the island of Tortuga 55 S6 THE RISE OF PIERRE LE GRAND was named Pierre le Grand,
            or Peter the Great. He was born at the town of Dieppe, in Normandy. The action which
            rendered him famous was his taking of the Vice-Admiral of the Spanish jiota}, nigh unto
            the Cape of Tiburon, upon the Western side of the island of Hispaniola. This bold
            e.xploit he performed alone with one only boat, wherein he had eight- and-twenty
            persons, no more, to help him. What gave occa- sion unto this enterprize was that until
            that time the Spaniards had passed and repassed with all security, and without finding
            the least opposition, through the Channel of Bahama. So that Pierre le Grand set out to
            sea by the Caicos, where he took this great ship with almost all facility imaginable.
            The Spaniards they found aboard were all set on shore, and the vessel presently sent
            into France. The manner how this undaunted spirit attempted and took such an huge ship,
            I shall give you out of the Journal of a true and faithful author in the same words I
            read them : The boat, saith he, wherein Pierre le Grand was with his companions, had now
            been at sea a long time, without finding anything, according to his intent of piracy
            suitable to make a prey. And now, their provisions beginning to fail, they could keep
            themselves no longer upon the ocean or they must of necessity starve. Being almost
            reduced to despair, they espied a great ship belonging to the Spanish flota which had
            separated from the rest. This bulky vessel they resolved to set upon and take, or die in
            the attempt. Hereupon they made sail towards her, with design to view her strength. And,
            although they judged the vessel to be far above their forces, yet the covetousness of
            such a prey and the extremity of fortune they were reduced unto, made them adventure
            upon such an enterprize. Being now come so near that they could not escape without
            danger of being all killed, the Pirates jointly made an oath unto their captain, Pierre
            le Grand, to behave themselves courageously in this attempt without the least fear or
            fainting. True it is that these rovers had conceived an opinion they should find the
            ship unprovided to fight, and that through this occasion they should master her by
            degrees. It was in the dusk of the evening, or soon after, when this great action was
            performed. But, before it was ^ Spanish, a fleet of merchant-ships. " The flota is a
            fleet of large ships which carry the goods of Europe to the ports of America, and bring
            back the produce of Mexico, Peru, and other kingdoms of the ^eyr World " — Swinburne.
            Travels in Spain [1779], Letter 28, PIRACY SI begun, they gave orders unto the surgeon
            of the hoot to bore a hole in the sides thereof, to the intent that, their own vessel
            sinking under them, they might be compelled to attack more vigorously and endeavour more
            hastily to run aboard the great ship. This was performed accordingly ; and, without any
            other arms than a pistol in one of their hands and a sword in the other, they
            immediately climbed up the sides of the ship, and ran altogether into the great cabin,
            where they found the Captain, with several of his companions, playing at cards. Here
            they set a pistol to his breast, commanding him to deliver up the ship unto their
            obedience. The Spaniards, seeing the Pirates aboard their ship, without scarce having
            seen them at sea, cried out : " Jesus bless us ! Are these devils, or what are they ? "
            In the meanwhile, some of them took possession of the gun-room, and seized the arms and
            military affairs they found there, killing as many of the ship as made any opposition.
            By which means the Spaniards presently were compelled to surrender. That very day the
            Captain of the ship had been told by some of the seamen that the boat, which was in view
            cruizing, was a boat of Pirates. Unto whom the Captain, slighting their advice, made
            answer : " What then ? Must I be afraid of such a pitiful thing as that is ? No, nor
            though she were a ship as big and as strong as mine is." As soon as Pierre le Grand had
            taken this magnificent prize, he detained in his service as many of the common seamen as
            he had need of, and the rest he set on shore. This being done, he immediately set sail
            for France, carrying with him all the riches he found in that huge vessel : there he
            continued without ever returning unto the parts of America. /The planters and hunters of
            the isle of Tortuga had no sooner understood this happy event, and the rich prize those
            Pirates had obtained, but they resolved to follow their example. Hereupon many of them
            left their ordinary exercises and common employments, and used what means they could to
            get either boats or small vessels wherein to exercise piracy. But, being not able either
            to purchase or build them at Tortuga, at last they resolved to set forth in their canoes
            and seek them elsewhere. With these, therefore, they cruized at first upon Cape
            d'Alvarez, whereabouts the Spaniards used much to trade from one city to another in
            small boats. In these they carry hides, tobacco, and other commodities unto the port of
            liavaiia, which is the nxetropolis of that island 58 PIRACY INCREASES and unto which the
            Spaniards from Europe do frequently resort. Hereabouts it was that those Pirates at the
            beginning took a great number of boats, laden with the aforesaid commodities. These
            boats they used to carry to the isle of Tortuga, and there sell the whole purchase unto
            the ships that waited in the port for their return or accidentally happened to be there.
            With the gains of these prizes they provided themselves with necessaries wherewithal to
            undertake other voyages./ Some of these voyages were made towards the coast of Campeche,
            and others towards that of New Spain ; in both which places the Spaniards at that time
            did frequently exercise much com- merce and trade. Upon those coasts they commonly found
            great number of trading vessels and many times ships of great burden. Two of the biggest
            of these vessels, and two great ships which the Spaniards had laden with plate in the
            port of Campeche to go unto Caracas, they took in less than a month's time, by cruizing
            to and fro. Being arrived at Tor- tuga with these prizes, and the whole people of the
            island admiring their progresses, especially that within the space of two years the
            riches of the country were much increased, the number also of Pirates did augment so
            fast that from these beginnings, within a little s^ace of time, there were to be num-
            bered in that small island and port above twenty ships of this sort of people. Hereupon
            the Spaniards, not able to bear their robberies any longer, were constrained to put
            forth to sea two great men-of-war, both for the defence of their own coasts and to
            cruize upon the enemies. CHAPTER VII After what manner the Pirates arm their vessels,
            and how they regulate their voyages /before the Pirates go out to sea, they give notice
            unto every- one that goes upon the voyage, of the day on which they ought precisely to
            embark, intimating also unto them their obliga- tion of bringing each man in particular
            so many pounds of powder and bullets as they think necessary for that expedition. Being
            all come on board, they join together in council, concern- ing what place they ought
            first to go unto wherein to get provisions — especially of flesh, seeing they scarce eat
            anything else.^ And of this the most common sort among them is pork. The next food is
            tortoises, which they use to salt a little. Sometimes they resolve to rob such or such
            hog-yards, wherein the Spaniards often have a thousand head of swine together. They come
            unto these places in the dark of the night, and, having beset the keeper's lodge, they
            force him to rise and give them as many heads as they desire, threatening withal to kill
            him in case he disobeys their commands or makes any noise. Yea, these menaces are
            oftentimes put in execu- tion, without giving any quarter unto the miserable swine-
            keepers or any other person that endeavours to hinder their robberies. Tlaving gotten
            provisions of flesh sufficient for their voyage, they return unto their ship. Here their
            allowance, twice a day to every one, is as much as he can eat, without either weight or
            measure. Neither does the steward of the vessel give any greater proportion of flesh, or
            anything else, unto the Captain than unto the meanest mariner. The ship being well
            victualled, they call another council, to deliberate towards what place they shall go to
            seek their desperate fortunes. In this council, likewise, they agree upon certain
            articles, which are put in writing, by way of bond or obligation, which every one is
            bound to ob- 59 6o ARTICLES OF ASSOCIATION serve, and all of them, or the chiefest, do
            set their hands unto. Herein they specify, and set down very distinctly, what sums of
            money each particular person ought to have for that voyage, the fund of all the payments
            being the common stock of what is gotten by the whole expedition ; for otherwise it is
            the same law, among these people as with other Pirates : No prey, no pay. In the first
            place, therefore, they mention how much the Captain ought to have for his ship. Next the
            salary of the carpenter, or shipwright, who careened, mended, and rigged the vessel.
            This commonly amounts unto loo or 150 pieces-of- eight^, being, according to the
            agreement, more or less. Afterwards for provisions and victualling they draw out of the
            same common stock about 200 pieces-of-eight. Also a competent salary for the surgeon and
            his chest of medica- ments, which usually is rated at 200 or 250 pieces-of-eight.
            Lastly, they stipulate in writing what recompense or re- ward each one ought to have
            that is either wounded or maimed in his body, suffering the loss of any limb, by that
            voyage. Thus they order for the loss of a right arm 600 pieces-of-eight, or 6 slaves;
            for the loss of a left arm 500 pieces-of-eight, or 5 slaves ; for a right leg 500
            pieces-of- eight, or 5 slaves ; for a left leg 400 pieces-of-eight, or 4 slaves ; for an
            eye 100 pieces-of-eight, or one slave ; for a finger of the hand the same reward as for
            the eye. All which sums of money, as I have said before, are taken out of the capital
            sum or common stock of what is gotten by their piracy. For a very exact and equal
            dividend is made of the remainder among them all. Yet herein they have also regard unto
            qualities and places. Thus the Captain, or chief Commander, is allotted five or six
            portions to what the ordi- nary seamen have ; the Master's Mate only two ; and other
            Officers proportionable to their employment. After whom they draw equal parts from the
            highest even to the lowest mariner, the boys not being omitted. For even these draw half
            a share, by reason that, when they happen to take a better vessel than their own, it is
            the duty of the boys to set fire unto the ship or boat wherein they are, and then retire
            unto the prize which they have taken. ^ A piece-of-eight is about five shillings
            sterling. (Note in original book.) It is a " hard doJl?Lr ", the Spanish piaster, wprtti
            ^.bput 4s. 2d. (before i9M)-i TORTOISES 6 1 They observe among themselves very good
            orders. For in the prizes they take, it is severely prohibited unto every one to usurp
            anything in particular unto themselves. Hence all they take is equally divided,
            according to what has been said before. Yea, they make a solemn oath to each other not
            to abscond, or conceal the least thing they find amongst the prey. If afterwards any one
            is found unfaithful, and has contravened the said oath, immediately he is separated and
            turned out of the society. Among themselves they are very civil and charitable to each
            other. Insomuch that, if any wants what another has, with great liberality they give it
            one to another. As soon as these Pirates have taken any prize of ship or boat, the first
            thing they endeavour is to set on shore the prisoners, detaining only some few for their
            own help and service, unto whom also they give their Hberty after the space of two or
            three years.^They put in very frequently for refreshment at one island or another, but
            more especially into those which lie on the Southern side of the isle of Cuba. Here they
            careen their vessels, and in the meanwhile some of them go to hunt, others to cruize
            upon the seas in canoes, seeking their fortune. Many times they take the poor fishermen
            of tortoises, and, carrying them to their habitations, they make them work so long as
            the Pirates are pleased. In the several parts of America are found four distinct species
            of tortoises. The first hereof are so great that every one reaches to the weight of 2 or
            3 thousand pounds. The scales of the species are so soft as that easily they may be cut
            with a knife. Yet these tortoises are not good to be eaten. The second species is of an
            indifferent bigness, and are green in colour. The scales of these are harder than the
            first, and this sort is of a very pleasant taste. The third is very little different in
            size and bigness from the second, unless that it has the head something bigger. This
            third species is called by the French cavana, and is not good for food. The fourth is
            named caret, being very like to the tortoises we have in Europe. This sort keeps most
            commonly among the rocks, whence they crawl out to seek their food, which is for the
            greatest part nothing but apples of the sea. Those other species above- mentioned feed
            upon grass which grows in the water upon the banks of the sand. These banks, or shelves,
            for their pleasant green do here resemble the deUghtful meadows of the United 62 MANNER
            OF FISHING FOR TORTOISES Provinces. Their eggs are almost like unto those of the
            crocodile, but without any shell, being only covered with a thin membrane or film. They
            are found in such prodigious quantities along the sandy shores of those countries that,
            were they not frequently destroyed by birds, the sea would infinitely abound with
            tortoises. These creatures have certain customary places whither they repair every year
            to lay their eggs. The chiefest of these places are the three islands called Caymanes,
            situated in the latitude of 20 degrees and 15 minutes North, being at the distance of
            five-and-forty-leagues from the isle of Cuba, on- the Northern side thereof. It is a
            thing much deserving consideration how the tortoises can find out these islands. For the
            greatest part of them come from the Gulf of Honduras, distant thence the whole space of
            150 leagues. Certain it is, that many times the ships, having lost their latitude
            through the darkness of the weather, have steered their course only by the noise of
            tortoises swimming that way, and have arrived unto those isles. When their season of
            hatching is past, they retire towards the island of Cuba, where are many good places
            that afford them food. But while they are at the islands of Caymanes, they eat very
            little or nothing. When they have been about the space of one month in the seas of Cuba,
            and are grown fat, the Span- iards go out to fish for them, they being then to be taken
            in such abundance that they provide with them sufficiently their cities, towns, and
            villages. Their manner of taking them is by making with a great nail a certain kind of
            dart. This they fix at the end of a long stick or pole, with which they wound the
            tortoises, as with a dagger, whensoever they appear above water to breathe fresh air.
            The inhabitants of New Spain and Campeche lade their principal sorts of merchandizes in
            ships of great bulk ; and with these they exercise their commerce to and fro. The
            vessels from Campeche in winter-time set out towards Caracas, Trinity Isles, and that of
            Margarita. For in summer the winds are contrary, though very favourable to return unto
            Campeche, as they use to do at the beginning of that season. The Pirates are not
            ignorant of these times, being very dexterous in searching out all places and
            circumstances most suitable to their designs. Hence in the places and seasons afore-
            FRANgOIS ATTACKS PEARL-FISHERS 63 mentioned, they cruize upon the said ships for some
            while. But, in case they can perform nothing, and that fortune does not favour them with
            some prize or other, after holding a council thereupon, they commonly enterprize things
            very desperate. Of these their resolutions I shall give you one instance very
            remarkable. One certain Pirate, whose name was Pierre Francois or Peter Francis,
            happened to be a long time at sea with his boat and six-and- twenty persons, waiting for
            the ships that were to return from Maracaibo towards Campeche. Not being able to find
            anything, nor get any prey, at last he resolved to direct his course to Rancherias,
            which is nigh unto the river called De la Plata, in the latitude of
            twelve-degrees-and-a-half North. In this place lies a rich bank of pearl, to the fishery
            whereof they yearly send from Cartagena a fleet of a dozen vessels, with a man-of-war
            for their defence. Every vessel has at least a couple of negroes in it, who are very
            dexterous in diving, even to the depths of six fathoms within the sea, whereabouts they
            find good store of pearls. Upon this fleet of vessels, though small, called the Pearl
            Fleet, Pierre Francois resolved to adventure rather than go home with empty hands. They
            rode at anchor, at that time, at the mouth of the river De la Hacha, the man-of-war
            being scarce half-a-league distant from the small ships, and the wind very calm. Having
            espied them in this posture, he presently pulled down his sails and rowed along the
            coast, dissembling to be a Spanish vessel that came from Maracaibo and only passed that
            way. But, no sooner was he come unto the Pearl Bank, when suddenly he assaulted the
            Vice-Admiral of the said fleet, mounted with 8 guns and three-score men well armed,
            commanding them to surrender, But the Spaniards, running to their arms, did do what they
            could to defend them- selves, fighting for some while ; till at last they were
            constrained to submit unto the Pirate. Being thus possessed of the Vice- Admiral, he
            resolved next to adventure with some other stratagem upon the man-of-war, thinking
            thereby to get strength sufficient to master the rest of the fleet. With this intent he
            presently sank his own boat in the river ; and, putting forth the Spanish colours,
            weighed anchor ; with a Httle wind they began to stir, having with promises and menaces
            compelled most of the Spaniards to assist him in his design. But no sooner did the
            man-of-war perceive one 64 SURRENDER TO THE MAN-OF-WAR of his fleet to set sail when he
            did so too, fearing lest the mariners should have any design to run away with the vessel
            and riches they had on board. This caused the Pirates immediately to give over that
            dangerous enterprize, as think- ing themselves unable to encounter force to force with
            the said man-of-war that now came against them. Hereupon they attempted to get out of
            the river and gain the open seas with the riches they had taken, by making as much sail
            as possibly the vessel would bear. This being perceived by the man-of- war, he presently
            gave 'um chase. But the Pirates, having laid on too much sail, and a gust of wind
            suddenly arising, had their main -mast blown down by the board, which disabled 'um from
            prosecuting their escape. This unhappy event much encouraged those that were in the
            man-of-war, they advancing and gaining upon the Pirates every moment ; by which means at
            last they were overtaken. But, these notwithstanding, finding themselves still with
            two-and-twenty persons sound, the rest being either killed or wounded, resolved to
            defend themselves so long as it were possible. This they performed very courageously for
            some while, until thereunto forced by the man-of-war, they were compelled to surrender.
            Yet was not this done without articles, which the Spaniards were glad to allow them, as
            follows : That they should not use them as slaves, forcing them to carry or bring stones
            or employing them in other labours for three or four years, as they commonly employ
            their negroes. But that they should set them on shore upon free land, without doing them
            harm in their bodies. Upon these articles they delivered themselves, with all that they
            had taken, which was worth only in pearls to the value of above 100,000 pieces-of
            -eight, besides the vessel, provisions, goods, and Sther things. All which being put
            together would have made unto this Pirate one of the greatest prizes he could desire ;
            which he had obtained, had it not been for the loss of his main-mast, as was said
            before. Another bold attempt, not unlike unto that which I have related nor less
            remarkable, I shall also give you at present. A certain Pirate, born in Portugal and
            from the name of his country called Bartholomew Portugues, was cruizing in his boat from
            Jamaica (wherein he had only thirty men and four small guns) upon the Cape de
            Corrientes, in the island of Cuba. BARTHOLOMEW PORTUGUES 67 In this place he met with a
            great ship that came from Mara- caibo and Cartegena, bound for the Havana, well provided
            with twenty great guns and threescore-and-ten men, between passengers and mariners. This
            ship he presently assaulted, but found as strongly defended by them that were on board.
            The Pirate escaped the first encounter, resolving to attack her more vigorously than
            before, seeing he had sustained no great damage hitherto. This resolution he boldly
            performed, renewing his assaults so often till that, after a long and dangerous fight,
            he became master of the great vessel. The Portuguese lost only ten men and had four
            wounded, so that he had still remaining twenty fighting men, whereas the Spaniards had
            double the same number. Having possessed themselves of such a ship, and the wind being
            contrary to return unto Jamaica, they resolved to steer their course towards the Cape of
            Saint Antony (which lies on the Western side of the isle of Cuba), there to repair
            themselves and take in fresh water, of which they had great necessity at that time.
            Being now very near unto the cape above-mentioned, they unexpectedly met with three
            great ships that were coming from New Spain and bound for the Havana. By these, as not
            being able to escape, they were easily retaken, both ship and Pirates. Thus they were
            all made prisoners through the sudden change of fortune, and found themselves poor, op-
            pressed, and stripped of all the riches they had purchased^ so httle before. The cargo
            of this ship consisted of 120,000 weight of coco-nuts, the chiefest ingredient of that
            rich Uquor called chocolate, and threescore-and-ten thousand pieces-of-eight. Two days
            after this misfortune, there happened to arise an huge and dangerous tempest, which
            largely separated the ships from one another. The great vessel, wherein the Pirates
            were, arrived at Campeche, where many considerable merchants came to salute and welcome
            the Captain thereof. These presently knew the Portuguese Pirate, as being him who had
            committed innumerable excessive insolences upon those coasts, not only infinite murders
            and robberies but also lamentable * Obsolete use of the word ' purchase ' (vb. and
            noun), originally "the action of hunting; the chase; the catching or seizing of prey"

            early, books on the Buccaneers. 68 CAPTURE OF PORTUGUES incendiums^, which those of
            Campeche still preserved very fresh in their memory. Hereupon, the next day after their
            arrival, the magistrates of the city sent several of their officers to demand and take
            into custody the criminal prisoners from on board the ship, with intent to punish them
            according to their deserts. Yet, fearing lest the Captain of those Pirates should escape
            out of their hands on shore (as he had formerly done, being once their prisoner in the
            city before), they judged it more convenient to leave him safely guarded on board the
            ship for the present. In the meanwhile they caused a gibbet to be erected, whereupon to
            hang him the very next day, without any other form of process than to lead him from the
            ship unto the place of punishment. The rumour of this future tragedy was presently
            brought unto Bartholo- mew Portugues' ears, whereby he sought all the means he could to
            escape that night. With this design he took two earthen jars, wherein the Spaniards
            usually carry wine from Spain unto the West Indies, and stopped them very well,
            intending to use them for swimming, as those who are unskil- ful in that art do
            calabashes, a sort of pumpkins, in Spain, and in other places empty bladders. Having
            made this necessary preparation, he waited for the night, when all should be asleep,
            even the sentry that guarded him. But, seeing he could not escape his vigilancy, he
            secretly purchased a knife, and with the same gave him such a mortal stab as suddenly
            deprived him of life and the possibility of making any noise. At that instant he
            committed himself to sea, with those two earthen jars before-mentioned, and by their
            help and support, though never having learned to swim, he reached the shore. Being
            arrived upon land, without any delay he took his refuge in the woods, where he hid
            himself for three days, with- out daring to appear, nor eating any other food than wild
            herbs. Those of the city failed not the next day to make a diligent search for him in
            the woods, where they concluded him to be. This strict inquiry Portugues had the
            convenience to espy from the hollow ojf a tree, wherein he lay absconded. Hence
            perceiving them to return without finding what they sought for, he adventured to sally
            forth towards the coasts called Del * Conflagrations. So-used in Howell, Parthenop.
            [1654], Preface. ESCAPE OF PORTUGUES 69 Golfo Triste, forty leagues distant from the
            city of Campeche. Hither he arrived within a fortnight after his escape from the ship.
            In which space of time, as also afterwards, he endured extreme hunger, thirst, and fears
            of falling again into the hands of the Spaniards. For during all this journey he had no
            other provision with him than a small calabash, with a little water ; neither did he eat
            anything else than a few shell-fish, which he found among the rocks nigh the sea-shore.
            Besides that, he was compelled to pass yet some rivers, not knowing well to swim. Being
            in this distress, he found an old board which the waves had thrown upon the shore,
            wherein did stick a few great nails. These he took, and with no small labour whetted
            against a stone, until that he had made them capable of cutting like unto knives, though
            very imperfectly. With these, and no better instruments, he cut down some branches of
            trees, the which with twigs and osiers he joined together, and made as well as he could
            a boat, or rather a raft ^, wherewith he rafted* over the rivers. Thus he arrived
            finally at the Cape of Golfo Triste, as was said before, where he happened to find a
            certain vessel of Pirates, who were great comrades of his own, and were lately come from
            Jamaica. Unto these Pirates he instantly related all his adversities and misfortunes,
            and withal demanded of them that they would fit him with a boat and 20 men. With which
            company alone he promised to return to Campeche and assault the ship that was in the
            river, by which he had been taken, and escaped fourteen days before. They readily
            granted his request, and equipped him a boat with the said number of men. With this
            small company he set forth towards the execution of his design, which he bravely
            performed eight days after he separated from his comrades at the Cape of Golfo Triste.
            For, being arrived at the river of Campeche, with an undaunted courage and without any
            rumour of noise he assaulted the ship before- mentioned. Those that were on board were
            persuaded this was a boat from land that came to bring contra banda goods ; and hereupon
            were not in any posture of defence. Thus the Pirates, laying hold on this occasion,
            assaulted them with- out any fear of ill success, and in short space of time com- pelled
            the Spaniards to surrender. * In the original ' wafte.' « In the original ' wafted.' No

            weighed anchor and set sail, determining to fly from the port lest they should be
            pursued by other vessels. This they did with extremity of joy, seeing themselves
            possessors of such a brave ship. Especially Portugues, their captain, who now by a
            second turn of fortune's wheel was become rich and powerful again, who had been so
            lately in that same vessel a poor miserable prisoner and condemned to the gallows. With
            this great purchase he designed in his mind greater things ; which he might well hope to
            obtain, seeing he had found in the vessel great quantity of rich merchandize still
            remaining on board, although the plate had been transported into the city. Thus he
            continued his voyage towards Jamaica for some days. But coming nigh into the isle of
            Pinos, on the South side of the island of Cuba, fortune suddenly turned her back unto
            him once more, never to show him her countenance again. For a horrible storm arising at
            sea occasioned the ship to spUt against the rocks or banks called Jardines. Insomuch
            that the vessel was totally lost, and Portugues, with his companions, escaped in a
            canoe. After this manner he arrived at Jamaica, where he remained no long time, being
            only there till he could prepare himself to seek his fortune anew, which from that time
            proved always adverse unto him. Nothing less rare and admirable than the preceding are
            the actions of another Pirate, who at present lives at Jamaica, and who has on sundry
            occasions enterprized and achieved things very strange. The place of his birth was the
            city of Groningen, in the United Provinces ; but his own proper name is not known : the
            Pirates, his companions, having only given him that of Roche Brasiliano by reason of his
            long residence in the country of Brazil, whence he was forced to flee, when the
            Portuguese retook those countries from the West India Company of Amsterdam, several
            nations then inhabiting at Brazil (as English, French, Dutch, and others) being con-
            strained to seek new fortunes. This fellow at that conjuncture of time retired unto
            Jamaica, where, being at a stand how to get a livelihood, he entered himself into the
            society of Pirates. Under these he served in quality of a private mariner for some
            while, in which degree he behaved himself so well as made him both beloved and respected
            by all, as one that deserved to be their ROCHE BRASILIANO'S CRUELTY 73 Commander for the
            future. One day certain mariners hap- pened to engage in a dissension with their Captain
            ; the effect whereof was that they left the boat. BrasiHano followed the rest, and by
            these was chosen for their conductor and leader, who also fitted him out a boat or small
            vessel, wherein he received the title of Captain. Few days were past from his being
            chosen Captain, when he took a great ship that was coming from New Spain, on board of
            which he found great quantity of plate, and both one and the other he carried to
            Jamaica. This action gave him renown, and caused him to be both esteemed and feared,
            every one apprehending him much aboard. Howbeit, in his domestic and private affairs he
            had no good behaviour nor government over himself ; for in these he would oftentimes
            shew himself either brutish or foolish. Many times being in drink, he would run up and
            down the streets, beating or wounding whom he met, no person daring to oppose him or
            make any resistance. Unto the Spaniards he always showed himself very bar- barous and
            cruel, only out of an inveterate hatred he had against that nation. Of these he
            commanded several to be roasted alive upon wooden spits, for no other crime than that
            they would not shew him the places, or hog-yards, where he might steal swine. After many
            of these cruelties, it happened, as he was cruizing upon the coasts of Campeche, that a
            dismal tempest suddenly surprised him. This proved to be so violent that at last his
            ship was wrecked upon the coasts, the mariners only escaping with their muskets and some
            few bullets and powder, which were the only things they could save of all that was in
            the vessel. The place where the ship was lost was precisely between Campeche and the
            Golfo Triste. Here they got on shore in a canoe, and, marching along the coast with all
            the speed they could, they directed their course towards Golfo Triste, as being a place
            where the Pirates commonly used to repair and refresh themselves. Being upon this
            journey and all very hungry and thirsty, as is usual in desert places, they were pursued
            by some Spaniards, being a whole troop of a hundred horsemen. Brasiliano no sooner
            perceived this imminent danger than he animated his companions, tell- ing them : We had
            better, fellow soldiers, choose to die under our arms fighting, as it becomes men of
            courage, than surrender 74 BRASILIANO SEIZES FLEET OF CANOES unto the Spaniards, who, in
            case they overcome us, will take away our lives with cruel torments. The Pirates were no
            more than 30 in number, who, notwithstanding, seeing their brave Commander oppose
            himself with courage unto the enemy, resolved to do the Hke. Hereupon they faced the
            troop of Spaniards, and discharged their muskets against them with such dexterity that
            they killed one horsemen with almost every shot. The fight continued for the space of an
            hour, till at last the Spaniards were put to flight by the Pirates. They stripped the
            dead, and took from them what they thought most convenient for their use. But such as
            were not already dead, they helped to quit the miseries of life with the ends of their
            muskets. Having vanquished the enemy, they all mounted on several horses they found in
            the field, and continued the journey aforementioned, Brasiliano having lost but two of
            his com- panions in this bloody fight, and had two others wounded. As they prosecuted
            their way, before they came unto the port they espied a boat from Campeche, well manned,
            that rode at anchor, protecting a small number of canoes that were lading wood. Hereupon
            they sent a detachment of six of their men to watch them ; and these the next morning by
            a wild [assault] possessed themselves of the canoes. Having given notice unto their
            companions, they went all on board, and with no great difficulty took also the boat, or
            little man-of-war, their convoy. Thus having rendered themselves masters of the whole
            fleet, they wanted only provisions, which they found but very small aboard those
            vessels. But this defect was supplied by the horses, which they instantly killed and
            salted with salt, which by good fortune the woodcutters had brought with them. Upon
            which victuals they made shift to keep themselves until such time as they could purchase
            better. These very same Pirates, I mean Brasiliano and his com- panions, took also
            another ship that was going from New Spain unto Maracaibo, laden with divers sorts of
            merchandize, and a very considerable number of pieces-of-eight, which were designed to
            buy coco-nuts for their lading home. All these prizes they carried into Jamaica, where
            they safely arrived, and, according to their custom, wasted in a few days in taverns and
            stews all they had gotten, by giving themselves to all manner of debauchery with
            strumpets and wine. Such of DEBAUCHERY OF THE BUCCANEERS 75 these Pirates are found who
            will spend 2 or 3 thousand pieces-of-eight in one night, not leaving themselves
            peradven- ture a good shirt to wear on their backs in the morning. Thus upon a certain
            time I saw one of them give unto a common strumpet five hundred pieces-of-eight only
            that he might see her naked. My own master would buy, on hke occasions, a whole pipe of
            wine, and, placing it in the street, would force every one that passed by to drink with
            him ; threatening also to pistol them, in case they would not do it. At other times he
            would do the same with barrels of ale or beer. And, very often, with both his hands, he
            would throw these liquors about the streets, and wet the clothes of such as walked by,
            without regarding whether he spoiled their apparel or not, were they men or women. Among
            themselves, and to each other, these Pirates are extremely liberal and free. If any one
            of them has lost all his goods, which often happens in their manner of life, they freely
            give him, and make him partaker of what they have. In taverns and ale-houses they always
            have great credit ; but in such houses at Jamaica they ought not to run very deep in
            debt, seeing the inhabitants of that island do easily sell one another for debt. Thus it
            happened unto my patron, or master, to be sold for a debt of a tavern, wherein he had
            spent the greatest part of his money. This man had, within the space of three months
            before, 3000 pieces-of-eight in ready cash, all which he wasted in that short space of
            time, and became so poor as I have told you. But now to return to our discourse : I must
            let my reader know that BrasiHano, after having spent all that he had robbed, was
            constrained to go to sea again, to seek his fortune once more. Thus he set forth towards
            the coast of Campeche, his common place of rendezvous. Fifteen days after his arrival
            there, he put himself into a canoe, with intent to espy the port of that city, and see
            if he could rob any Spanish vessel. But his fortune was so bad that both he and all his
            men were taken prisoners, and carried into the presence of the Governor. This man
            immediately cast them into a dungeon, with full intention to hang them every person. And
            doubt- less he had performed his intent, were it not for a stratagem that Brasiliano
            used, which proved sufficient to save their lives. He wrote therefore a letter unto the
            Governor, making him ^^ LEWIS SCOT; MANSVELT; J. DAVIS believe it came from other
            Pirates that were abroad at sea, and withal telling him : He should have a care how he
            used those persons he had in his custody. For in case he caused them any harm, they did
            swear unto him they would never give quarter to any person of the Spanish nation that
            should fall into their hands. Because these Pirates had been many times at Campeche, and
            in many other towns and villages of the West Indies belonging to the Spanish dominions,
            the Governor began to fear what mischief they might cause by means of their com- panions
            abroad, in case he should punish them. Hereupon he released them out of prison, exacting
            only an oath of them beforehand that they would leave their exercise of piracy for ever.
            And withal he sent them as common mariners, or pas- sengers in the galleons, to Spain.
            They got in this voyage altogether 500 pieces-of-eight, whereby they tarried not long
            there after their arrival. But, providing themselves with some few necessaries, they all
            returned unto Jamaica within a little while ; whence they set forth again to sea,
            committing greater robberies and cruelties than ever they had done before ; but more
            especially abusing the poor Spaniards that happened to fall into their hands, with all
            sorts of cruelty imaginable. y The Spaniards perceiving they could gain nothing upon
            this sort of people, nor diminish their number, which rather increased daily, resolved
            to diminish the number of their ships wherein they exercised trading to and fro. But
            neither was this resolution of any effect, or did them any good service. For the
            Pirates, finding not so many ships at sea as before, began to gather into greater
            companies and land upon the Spanish dominions, ruining whole cities, towns, and villages
            ; and withal pillaging, burning, and carrying away as much as they could [find]
            possible.^ The first Pirate who gave a beginning unto these invasions by land was named
            Lewis Scot, who sacked and pillaged the City of Campeche. He almost ruined the town,
            robbing and destroying all he could ; and, after he had put it to the ransom of an
            excessive sum of money, he left it. After Scot came another named Mansvelt, who
            enterprized to set footing in Granada, and penetrate with his piracies even unto the
            South Sea. Both which things he effected, till that at last, for want of I DAVIS* ATTACK
            ON NICARAGUA 77 provision, he was constrained to go back. He assaulted tlie isle of
            Saint Catharine, which was the first land he took, and upon it some few prisoners. These
            showed him the way to- wards Cartagena, which is a principal city situate in the king-
            dom of New Granada. But the bold attempts and actions of John Davis, born at Jamaica,
            ought not to be forgotten in this history, as being some of the most remarkable thereof
            : especially his rare prudence and valour, wherewith he behaved himself in the
            aforementioned kingdom of Granada. This Pirate, having cruized a long time in the Gulf
            of Pocatauro upon the ships that were expected from Cartagena bound for Nicaragua, and
            not being able to meet any of the said ships, resolved at last to land in Nicaragua,
            leaving his ship con- cealed about the coast. This design he presently put in execution.
            For taking four- score men, out of four-score-and-ten which he had in all (the rest
            being left to keep the ship), he divided them equally into three canoes. His intent was
            to rob the churches, and rifle the houses of the chief citizens of the aforesaid town of
            Nicaragua. Thus, in the obscurity of the night, they mounted the river which leads to
            that city, rowing with oars in their canoes. By day they concealed themselves and boats
            under the branches of trees that were upon the banks. These grow very thick and intri-
            cate along the sides of the rivers in those countries, as also along the sea-coast.
            Under which, likewise, those who re- mained behind absconded their vessel, lest they
            should be seen either by fishermen or Indians. After this manner they arrived at the
            city the third night, where the sentry who kept the post of the river thought them to be
            fishermen that had been fishing in the lake. And as the greatest part of the Pirates are
            skilful in the Spanish tongue, so he never doubted thereof as soon as he heard them
            speak. They had in their company an Indian, who had run away from his master because he
            would make him a slave after having served him a long time. This Indian went first on
            shore, and, rushing at the sentry, he in- stantly killed him. Being animated with this
            success, they entered into the city, and went directly to three or four houses 9f the
            chief est citizens, where they knocked with dissimulation. These, believing them to be
            friends, opened the doors, and the Pirates, suddenly possessing themselves of the
            houses, robbed all the money and plate they could find. Neither did they 78 DAVIS
            RANSACKS SAINT AUGUSTINE spare the churches and most sacred things, all which were
            pillaged and profaned without any respect or veneration. In the meanwhile great cries
            and lamentation were heard about the town, of some who had escaped their hands ; by
            which means the whole city was brought into an uproar and alarm. Hence the whole number
            of citizens rallied together, intending to put themselves in defence. This being
            perceived by the Pirates, they instantly put themselves to flight, carry- ing with them
            all that they had robbed, and likewise some prisoners. These they led away, to the
            intent that, if any of them should happen to be taken by the Spaniards, they might make
            use of them for ransom. Thus they got unto their ship, and with all speed imaginable put
            out to sea, forcing the prisoners, before they would let them go, to procure them as
            much flesh as they thought necessary for their voyage to Jamaica. But, no sooner had
            they weighed anchor, when they saw on shore a troop of about five hundred Spaniards, all
            being very well armed, at the sea-side. Against these they let fly several guns,
            wherewith they forced them to quit the sands and retire towards home, with no small
            regret to see those Pirates carry away so much plate of their churches and houses,
            though distant at least 40 leagues from the sea. 'Hrhese Pirates robbed on this occasion
            above 4000 pieces-of- eight in ready money, besides great quantities of plate uncoined
            and many j ewels . All which was computed to be worth the sum of 50,000 pieces-of-eight
            or more. With this great purchase they arrived at Jamaica soon after the exploit. But,
            as this sort of people are never masters of their money but a very little while, so were
            they soon constrained to seek more, by the same means they had used before. This
            adventure caused Captain John Davis, presently after his return, to be chosen Admiral of
            seven or eight boats of Pirates, he being now es- teemed by common consent an able
            conductor for such enter- prizes as these were. He began the exercise of this new
            command by directing his fleet towards the coasts of the north of Cuba, there to wait
            for the fleet which was to pass from New Spain. But, not being able to find anything by
            this design, they determined to go towards the coasts of Florida. Being arrived there,
            they landed part of their men, and sacked a small city named Saint Augustine of Florida,
            the castle ot which place had a garrison of 200 men, the which, notwith- END OF THE
            FIRST PART 79 standing, could not prevent the pillage of the city, they effect- ing it
            without receiving the least damage from either soldiers or townsmen./ Hitherto we have
            spoken in the First Part of this book of the constitution of the islands of Hispaniola
            and Tortuga, their peculiarities and inhabitants ; as also of the fruits to be found in
            those countries. In the Second Part of this work we shall bend our discourse to describe
            the actions of two of the most famous Pirates, who committed many horrible crimes and
            inhuman cruelties against the Spanish nation. The End of ihe First Part PART II CHAPTER
            I Origin of Francis VOllonais, and beginning of his robberies /Francis L'Ollonais was
            native of that territory in France which is called Les Sables d'Ollone, or the Sands of
            OUone. In his youth he was transported to the Caribbee Islands, in quality of a servant
            or slave, according to the custom of France and other countries ; of which we have
            already spoken in the First Part of this book. Being out of his time, when he had
            obtained his freedom, he came into the isle of Hispaniola. Here he placed himself for
            some while among the hunters, before he began his robberies against the Spaniards,
            whereof I shall make mention at present, until his unfortunate death. At first he made
            two or three voyages in quality of a common mariner, wherein he behaved himself so
            courageously as to deserve the favour and esteem of the Governor of Tortuga, who was
            then Monsieur de la Place. Insomuch that this gentleman gave him a ship, and made him
            captain thereof, to the intent he might seek his fortune. This Dame shewed herself very
            favourable to him at the beginning, for in a short while he purchased great riches./But,
            withal, his cruelties against the Spaniards were such as that the very fame of them made
            him known through the whole Indies. For which rea- son the Spaniards, in his time,
            whensoever they were attacked by sea, would choose rather to die or sink fighting than
            surren- der, as knowing they should have no mercy nor quarter at his hands. But as
            Fortune is seldom constant, so after some time she turned her back unto him. The
            beginning of whose disasters was, that in a huge storm he lost his ship upon the coasts
            of Campeche. The men were all saved ; but, coming upon dry land, the Spaniards pursued
            them, and killed the greatest part, wounding also L'Ollonais, their captain. Not knowing
            how to escape, he thought to save his life by a strata- G 8i 82 ESCAPE OF UOLLONAIS gem.
            Hereupon he took several handf uls of sand and mingled them with the blood of his own
            wounds, with which he be- smeared his face and other parts of his body. Then, hiding
            himself dexterously among the dead, he continued there till the Spaniards had quitted
            the field. After they were gone, he retired into the woods, and bound up his wounds as
            well as he could. These being by the help of nature pretty well healed, he took his way
            to the city of Campeche, having perfectly disguised himself in Spanish habit. Here he
            spoke with certain slaves, unto whom he promised their liberty in case they would obey
            him and trust in his conduct. They accepted his promises, and, stealing one night a
            canoe from one of their masters, they went to sea with the Pirate. The Spaniards in the
            meanwhile had made prisoner several of his companions, whom they kept in close dungeons
            in the city, while L'Ollonais went about the town and saw all that passed. These were
            often asked by the Spaniards : What is become of your Captain ?, unto whom they
            constantly answered : He is dead. With which news the Spaniards were hugely gladded, and
            made great demonstrations of joy, kindling bonfires, and, [like] as them that knew
            nothing to the contrary, giving thanks to God Almighty for their deliverance from such a
            cruel Pirate. L'Ollonais, having seen these joys for his death, made haste to escape
            with the slaves above-mentioned, and came safe to Tortuga, the common place of refuge of
            all sorts of wickedness, and the seminary, as it were, of all manner of Pirates and
            thieves. Though now his fortune was but low, yet he failed not of means to get another
            ship, which with craft and subtlety he obtained, and in it one-and-twenty persons. Being
            well provided with arms and other necessaries, he set forth towards the isle of Cuba, on
            the South side whereof lies a small village, which is called De los Cayos. The
            inhabitants of this town drive a great trade in tobacco, sugar, and hides — and all in
            boats, as not being able to make use of ships by reason of the little depth of that sea.
            L'Ollonais was greatly persuaded he should get here some considerable prey ; but, by the
            good fortune of some fishermen who saw him and the mercy of the Almighty, they escaped
            his t5Tannical hands. For the inhabitants of the town of Cayos despatched immediately a
            messenger overland unto L'OLLONAIS* CRUELTY 85 Havana, complaining unto the Governor
            that L'Ollonais was come to destroy them, with two canoes. The Governor could very
            hardly be persuaded unto the truth of this story, seeing he had received letters from
            Campeche that he was dead. Notwithstanding, at the importunity of the petitioners he
            sent a ship to their relief, with 10 guns and fourscore-and-ten persons, well armed ;
            giving them withal this express command : They should not return unto his presence
            without having totally destroyed those Pirates. Unto this effect he gave them also a
            negro, who might serve them for a hangman ; his orders being that They should
            immediately hang every one of the said Pirates excepting L'Ollonais their Captain, whom
            they should bring alive unto Havana. This ship arrived at Cayos ; of whose coming the
            Pirates were advertised beforehand ; and, instead of flying, went to seek the said
            vessel in the river Estera, where she rode at anchor. The Pirates apprehended some
            fishermen, and forced them by night to shew the entry of the port, hoping soon to obtain
            a greater vessel than their two canoes, and thereby to mend their fortune. They arrived,
            after two o'clock in the morning, very nigh unto the ship. And the watch on board the
            ship asking them : Whence they came, and if they had seen any Pirates abroad, they
            caused one of the prisoners to answer : They had seen no Pirates, nor anything else.
            Which answer brought them into persuasion that they were fled away, having heard of
            their coming. But they experienced very soon the contrary ; for about break of day the
            Pirates began to assault the vessel on both sides with their two canoes. This attack
            they performed with such vigour that, although the Spaniards behaved themselves as they
            ought and made as good defence as they could, shooting against them likewise some great
            guns, yet they were forced to surrender, after being beaten by the Pirates, with swords
            in hand, down under the hatches. Hence L'Ollonais, com- manded them to be brought up one
            by one, and in this order caused their heads to be struck off. Among the rest came up
            the negro, designed to be the Pirates' executioner by the Governor of Havana. This
            fellow implored mercy at his hands very dolefully, desiring not to be killed, and
            telling L'Ollonais he was constituted hangman of that ship ; and that, in case he would
            spare him, he would tell him faithfully all that he should desire to know. L'Ollonais
            made him confess 86 UOLLONAIS RETURNS TO TORTUGA as many things as he thought fit to ask
            him ; and, having done, commanded him to be murdered with the rest. -^Thus he cruelly
            and barbarously put them all to death, reserving of the whole number only one alive,
            whom he sent back to the Governor of Havana, with this message given him in writing : /
            shall never henceforward give quarter to any Spaniard whatsoever ; and I have great
            hopes I shall execute on your own person the very same punishment I have done upon them
            you sent against me. Thus I have retaliated the kindness you designed unto me and my
            companio7is. The Governor was much troubled to understand these sad and withal insolent
            news ; which occasioned him to swear, in the presence of many, he would never grant
            quarter unto any Pirate that should fall into his hands. But the citizens of Havana
            desired him not to persist in the execution of that rash and rigorous oath, seeing the
            Pirates would certainly take occasion thence to do the same ; and they had an hundred
            times more opportunity of revenge than he : that, being necessitated to get their
            livelihood by fishery, they should hereafter always be in danger of losing their lives.
            By these reasons he was persuaded to bridle his anger, and remit the severity of his
            oath aforementioned.^ Now L'Ollonais had got himself a good ship, but withal very few
            provisions and people in it. Hereupon, to purchase both the one and the other, he
            resolved to use his customary means of cruizing from one port to another. Thus he did
            for some while, till at last, not being able to purchase anything, he determined to go
            unto the port of Maracaibo. Here he took by surprize a ship that was laden with plate
            and other merchan- dize, being outward bound to buy cacao-nuts. With these prizes he
            returned unto Tortuga, where he was received with no small joy by the inhabitants, they
            congratulating his happy success and their own private interest. He continued not long
            there, but pitched upon new designs of equipping a whole fleet, sufficient to transport
            500 men, with all other necessaries. With these preparations he resolved to go unto the
            Spanish dominions, and pillage both cities, towns, and villages, and finally take
            Maracaibo itself. For this purpose, he knew the island of Tortuga would afford him many
            resolute and cour- ageous men, very fit for such enterprizes. Besides that, he had in
            his service several prisoners, who were exactly acquainted with the ways and places he
            designed upon. CHAPTER II VOllonais equips a fleet to land upon the Spanish islands of
            America, with intent to rob, sack, and hum whatever he meets ^F this his design
            L'Ollonais gave notice unto all the Pirates who at that conjuncture of time were either
            at home or abroad ; by which means he got together in a little while above 400 men.
            Besides which, there was at that present in the isle of Tortuga another Pirate, whose
            name was Michael de Basco. This man by his piracy had gotten riches sufficient to live
            at ease and go no more abroad to sea ; having withal the office of Major of the island.
            Yet, seeing the great preparations that L'Ollonais made for this expedition, he entered
            into a straight league of friendship with him, and proffered unto him that, in case he
            would make him his chief Captain by land (seeing he knew the country very well and all
            its avenues), he would take part in his fortunes, and go along with him. They both
            agreed upon articles, with great joy of L'Ollonais, as knowing that Basco had performed
            great actions in Europe, and had gained the repute of a good soldier. He gave him,
            therefore, the command he desired, and the conduct of all his people by land. Thus they
            all embarked in eight vessels, that of L'Ollonais being the greatest, as having ten guns
            of in- different^ carriage. • All things being in readiness, and the whole company on
            board, they set sail together about the end of April, having a considerable number of
            men for those parts, that is in all six- hundred and-threescore persons. They directed
            their course towards that part which is called Bayala, situated on the North side of the
            island of Hispaniola. Here they also took into their company a certain number of French
            hunters, who volun- tarily offered themselves to go along with them. And here likewise
            they provided themselves with victuals and other necessaries for that voyage. * Here in

            ii, 181 : ' Their garters of an indifferent knit.' 87 88 TAKES TWO SPANISH SHIPS Hence
            they set sail again the last day of July, and steered directly towards the Eastern Cape
            of the isle called Punta d'Espada. Hereabouts they suddenly espied a ship that was
            coming from Porto Rico and bound for New Spain, being laden with coco-nuts. L'Ollonais,
            the Admiral, presently commanded the rest of the fleet they should wait for him nigh
            unto the isle of Savona, situate on the Eastern side of Cape Punta d'Espada, forasmuch
            as he alone intended to go and take the said vessel. The Spaniards, although they had
            been in sight now full two hours, and knew them to be Pirates, yet they would not flee,
            but rather prepared to fight, as being well armed, and provided of all things necessary
            thereunto. Thus the combat began between L'Ollonais and the Spanish vessel, which lasted
            three hours ; and, these being past, they sur- rendered unto him. This ship was mounted
            with i6 guns, and had 50 fighting men on board. Theyfound in her 120,000 weight of
            cacao, 40,000 pieces-of-eight, and the value of 10,000 more in jewels. L'Ollonais sent
            the vessel presently unto Tortuga to be unladed, with orders to return with the said
            ship as soon as possible to the isle of Savona, where he would wait for their coming. In
            the meanwhile the rest of the fleet, being arrived at the said island of Savona, met
            with another Spanish vessel that was coming from Comana with military provisions unto
            the isle of Hispaniola, and also with money to pay the garrisons of the said island.
            This vessel also they took without any resistance, although mounted with eight guns.
            Here were found seven thousand- weight of powder, great number of muskets and other
            things of this kind together, with 12,000 pieces-of-eight in ready money. These
            forementioned events gave good encouragement unto the Pirates, as judging them very good
            beginnings unto the business they had in hand, especially finding their fleet pretty
            well recruited within a little while. For, the first ship that was taken being arrived
            at Tortuga, the Governor ordered to be instantly unladen, and soon after sent her back
            with fresh provisions and other necessaries unto L'Ollonais. This ship he chose for his
            own, and gave that which he commanded unto his comrade Antony du Puis. Thus having
            received new recruits of men, in Heu of them he had lost in taking the prizes
            above-mentioned and by sickness, he found himself in a good condition to prosecute his
            voyage. All being well animated L'OLLONAIS SAILS FOR MARACAIBO 89 and full of courage,
            they set sail for Maracaibo, which port is situated in the province of New Venezuela, in
            the latitude of twelve degrees and some minutes North. This island is in length twenty
            leagues, and twelve in breadth. Unto this port also belong the islands of Onega and
            Monges. The East side thereof is called Cape St Roman, and the Western side Cape of
            Caquibacoa. The gulf is called by some the Gulf of Venezuela, but the Pirates usually
            call it the Bay of Maracaibo. At the beginning of this gulf are two islands, which
            extend for the greatest part from East to West. That [which] lies towards the East is
            called Isla de las Vigilias, or the Watch Isle, because in the middle thereof is to be
            seen a high hill, upon which stands a house wherein dwells perpetually a watchman. The
            other is called Isla de las Palomas, or the Isle of Pigeons. Between these two islands
            runs a little sea, or rather a lake, of fresh water, being three-score leagues in length
            and 30 in breadth ; which disgorges into the ocean, and dilates itself about the two
            islands aforementioned. Between them is found the best passage for ships, the channel of
            this passage being no broader than the flight of a great gun of eight pound carriage,
            more or less. Upon the Isle of Pigeons stands a castle to impede the entry of any
            vessels ; all such as will come in being necessitated to approach very nigh unto the
            castle, by reason of two banks of sand that lie on the other side, with only 14 foot
            water. Many other banks of sand are also found in this lake, as that which is called El
            Tablazo, or The Great Table, which is no deeper than ten foot ; but this lies forty
            leagues within the lake. Others there are that are no more than 6, 7, or 8 foot in
            depth. All of them are very dangerous, especially unto such mariners as are little ac-
            quainted with this lake. On the West side hereof is situated the city of Maracaibo,
            being very pleasant to the view, by reason its houses are built along the shore, having
            delicate prospects everywhere round about. The city may possibly contain three or four
            thousand persons, the slaves being included in this number ; all which do make a town of
            a reasonable bigness. Among these are judged to be eight hundred persons, more or less,
            able to bear arms, all of them Spaniards. Here are also one Parish Church, of very good
            fabric and well adorned, four monasteries, and one hospital. 90 THE ISLAND OF BORRICA
            The city is governed by a Deputy-Governor, who is sub- stituted here by the Governor of
            Caracas, as being his depen- dency. The commerce or trading here exercised consists for
            the greatest part in hides and tobacco. The inhabitants possess great numbers of cattle
            and many plantations, which extend for the space of thirty leagues within the country,
            especially on that side that looks towards the great and populous town of Gibraltar. At
            which place are gathered huge quantities of cacao-nuts, and all other sorts of garden-
            fruits, which greatly serve for the regalement and sustenance of the inhabitants of
            Maracaibo, whose territories are much drier than those of Gibraltar. Unto this place
            those of Maracaibo send great quantities of flesh ; they making returns in oranges,
            lemons, and several other fruits. For the in- habitants of Gibraltar have great scarcity
            of provisions of flesh, their fields being not capable of feeding cows or sheep. Before
            the city of Maracaibo lies a very spacious and secure port, wherein may be built all
            sort of vessels ; as having great convenience of timber, which may be transported
            thither at very little charge. Nigh unto the town lies also a small island called
            Borrica, which serves them to feed great numbers of goats, of which cattle the
            inhabitants of Maracaibo make greater use of their skins than their flesh or milk ; they
            mak- ing no great account of these two, unless while they are as yet but tender and
            young kids. In the fields about the town are fed some numbers of sheep, but of a very
            small size. In some of the islands that belong unto the lake, and in other places
            hereabouts, do inhabit many savage Indians, whom the Spaniards call bravos, or Wild.
            These Indians could never agree as yet, nor be reduced to any accord with the Spaniards,
            by reason of their brutish and untamable nature. They dwell for the most part towards
            the Western side of the lake, in little huts that are built upon trees which grow in the
            water, the cause hereof being only to exempt themselves as much as possible from the
            innumerable quantity of mosquitos or gnats that infest those parts, and by which they
            are tormented night and day. Towards the East side of the said lake are also to be seen
            whole towns of fishermen, who likewise are con- strained to live in huts, built upon
            trees, like unto the former. Another reason of thus dwelling is the frequent inundations
            of waters ; for, after great rains, the land is often overflowed GIBRALTAR; MERIDA 91
            for the space of 2 or 3 leagues, there being no less than five- and-twenty great rivers
            that feed this lake. The town of Gibraltar is also frequently drowned by these
            inundations, insomuch that the inhabitants are constrained to leave their houses and
            retire unto their plantations. Gibraltar is situated at the side of the lake, forty
            leagues or thereabouts within it, and receives its necessary provisions of flesh, as has
            been said, from Maracaibo. The town is inhabited by 1500 persons, more or less, whereof
            400 may be capable of bearing arms. The greatest part of the inhabitants keep open
            shops, wherein they exercise one mechanic trade or other. All the adjacent fields about
            this town are cultivated with numerous plantations of sugar and cacao, in which are many
            tall and beautiful trees, of whose timber houses may be built, and also ships. Among
            these trees are found great store of handsome and proportionable cedars, being seven or
            eight foot in circumference, which serve there very commonly to build boats and ships.
            These they build after such manner as to bear one only great sail ; and such vessels are
            called piraguas. The whole country round about is sufficiently furnished with rivers and
            brooks, which are very useful to the inhabitants in time of droughts, they opening in
            that occasion many little channels, through which they lead the rivulets to water their
            fields and plantations. They plant in like manner great quantity of tobacco, which is
            much esteemed in Europe ; and for its goodness is called there Tahaco de Sacerdotes, or
            Priests' Tobacco. They enjoy nigh twenty leagues of jurisdiction, which is bounded and
            defended by very high mountains that are perpetually covered with snow. On the other
            side of these mountains is situated a great city called Merida, unto which the town of
            Gibraltar is subject. All sort of merchandize is carried from this town unto the
            aforesaid city upon mules ; and that but at one season of the year, by reason of the
            excessive cold endured in those high mountains. Upon the said mules great returns are
            made in flour of meal, which comes from towards Peru by the way of Estaffe. Thus far I
            thought it convenient to make a short descrip- tion of the aforesaid lake of Maracaibo,
            and its situation ; to the intent my reader might the better be enabled to compre- hend
            what I shall say concerning what was acted by the 92 L'OLLONAIS CAPTURES THE FORT
            Pirates in this place, the history whereof I shall presently begin. As soon as L'OUonais
            arrived at the Gulf of Venezuela, he cast anchor with his whole fleet, out of sight of
            the watch- tower of the island of Vigilias, or Watch Isle. The next day, very early, he
            set sail hence, with all his ships, for the lake of Maracaibo ; where, being arrived,
            they cast anchor the second time. Soon after, they landed all their men, with design to
            attack in the first place the castle or fortress that commanded the bar, and is
            therefore called De la Barra. This fort consists only of several great baskets of earth,
            placed upon a rising ground, upon which are planted sixteen great guns, with several
            other heaps of earth round about, for covering the men within. The Pirates, having
            landed at a distance of a league from this fort, began to advance by degrees towards it.
            But the Governor thereof, having espied their landing, had placed an ambuscade of some
            of his men, with design to cut them off behind, while he meant to attack them in the
            front. This ambuscade was found out by the Pirates ; and, hereupon getting before, they
            assaulted and defeated it so entirely that not one man could retreat unto the castle.
            This obstacle being removed, L'OUonais with all his companions advanced in great haste
            towards the fort. And after a fight of almost three hours, wherein they behaved
            themselves with desperate courage, such as this sort of people are used to show, they
            became masters thereof, having made use of no other arms than their swords and pistols.
            And, while they were fighting, those who were routed in the ambuscade, not being able to
            get into the castle, retired towards the city of Maracaibo in great confusion and
            disorder, crying : The Pirates will presently he here with two-thousand meji and more.
            This city, having formerly been taken by such kind of people as these were, and sacked
            even to the remotest corners thereof, pre- served still in its memory a fresh idea of
            that misery. Here- upon, as soon as they heard this dismal news, they endeavoured to
            escape as fast as they could towards Gibraltar in their boats and canoes, carrying with
            them all the goods and money they could. Being come to Gibraltar, they dispersed the
            rumours that the fortress was taken, and that nothing had been saved, nor any person
            able to escape the fury of the Pirates. The castle being taken by the Pirates, as was
            said before, PIRATES MARCH INTO MARACAIBO 93 they presently made sign unto the ships of
            the victory they had obtained, to the end they should come farther in, without
            apprehension of any danger. The rest of that day was spent in ruining and demolishing
            the said castle. They nailed the guns, and burnt as much as they could not carry away ;
            bury- ing also the dead, and sending on board the fleet such as were wounded. The next
            day very early in the morning they weighed anchor, and directed their course all
            together towards the city of Maracaibo, distant only 6 leagues more or less from the
            fort. But the wind being very scarce, that day they could advance but little, as being
            forced to expect the flowing of the tide. The next morning they came within sight of the
            town, and began to make preparations for landing under the protection of their own guns,
            being persuaded the Spaniards might have laid an ambuscade among the trees and woods.
            Thus they put their men into canoes, which for that purpose they brought with them, and
            landed where they thought most convenient, shooting in the meanwhile very furiously with
            their great guns. Of the people that were in the canoes, half only went on shore ; the
            other half re- mained on board the said canoes. They fired with their guns from the
            ships as fast as was possible towards the woody part of the shore ; but could see, and
            were answered by, nobody. Thus they marched in good order into the town, whose
            inhabitants, as I told you before, were all retired into the woods, and towards
            Gibraltar, with their wives, children, and families. Their houses they left well
            provided with all sort of victuals, such as flour, bread, pork, brandy, wines, and good
            store of poultry. With these things the Pirates fell to banqueting and making good cheer
            ; for in four weeks before they had had no opportunity of filling their stomachs with
            such plenty. They instantly possessed themselves of the best houses in the town, and
            placed sentries everywhere they thought convenient. The great church served them for
            their main corps du garde. The next day they sent a body of 160 men to find out some of
            the inhabitants of the town, whom they understood were hidden in the woods not far
            thence. These returned that very night, bringing with them 20,000 pieces-of- eight,
            several mules laden with household goods and merchan- dize, and 20 prisoners, between
            men, women, and children. 94 PIRATES PROCEED TO GIBRALTAR Some of these prisoners were
            put to the rack, only to make them confess where they had hidden the rest of their goods
            ; but they could extort very little from them. L'OUonais, who never used to make any
            great account of murdering, though in cold blood, ten or twelve Spaniards, drew his
            cutlass and hacked one to pieces in the presence of all the rest, saying : If you do not
            confess and declare where you have hidden the rest of your goods, I will do the like to
            all your com- panions. At last, amongst these horrible cruelties and in- human threats,
            one was found who promised to conduct him and show the place where the rest of the
            Spaniards were hidden. But those that were fled, having intelligence that one had
            discovered their lurking holes unto the Pirates, changed place, and buried all the
            remnant of their riches underground, inso- much that the Pirates could not find them
            out, unless some other person of their own party should reveal them. Besides that, the
            Spaniards, flying from one place to another every day and often changing woods, were
            jealous even of each other, insomuch as the father scarce presumed to trust his own son.
            Finally, after that the Pirates had been fifteen days in Maracaibo, they resolved to go
            towards Gibraltar. But the inhabitants of this place, having received intelligence
            thereof beforehand, as also that they intended afterwards to go to Merida, gave notice
            of this design to the Governor thereof, who was a valiant soldier and had served his
            king in Flanders in many military offices. His answer was : He would have them take no
            care ; for he hoped in a little while to exterminate the said Pirates. Whereupon he
            transferred himself immedi- ately unto Gibraltar, with 400 men well armed, ordering at
            the same time the inhabitants of the said town to put them- selves in arms ; so that in
            all he made a body of 800 fighting men. With the same speed he commanded a battery to be
            raised towards the sea, whereon he mounted 20 guns, covering them all with great baskets
            of earth. Another battery like- wise he placed in another place, mounted with 8 guns.
            After this was done, he barricaded a highway or narrow passage into the town, through
            which the Pirates of necessity ought to pass ; opening at the same time another, through
            much dirt and mud, in the wood, which was totally unknown to the Pirates. THE PIRATES
            ATTACK GIBRALTAR 95 The Pirates, not knowing an5rthing of these preparations, having
            embarked all their prisoners and what they had robbed, took their way towards Gibraltar.
            Being come within sight of the place, they perceived the Royal standard hanging forth,
            and that those of the town had a mind to fight and defend their houses. L'Ollonais,
            seeing this resolution, called a council of war, to deliberate what he ought to do in
            such case ; propounding withal unto his officers and marines, that the difficulty of
            such an enterprize was very great, seeing the Spaniards had had so much time to put
            themselves in a posture of defence, and had gotten a good body of men together, with
            many martial provisions. But notwithstanding, said he, have a good courage. We must
            either defend ourselves like good soldiers, or lose our lives with all the riches we
            have gotten. Do as I shall do, who am your Captain. At other times we have fought with
            fewer men than we have in our company at present, and yet we have overcome greater
            numbers than there possibly can be in this town. The more they are, the more glory we
            shall attribute unto our fortune, and the greater riches we shall increase unto it. The
            Pirates were under this suspicion, that all those riches which the inhabitants of
            Maracaibo had absconded, were transported unto Gibraltar, or at least the greatest part
            thereof. After this speech, they all promised to follow him and obey very exactly his
            commands. Unto whom L'Ollonais made answer : 'Tis well ; but know ye withal that the
            first man who shall show any fear, or the least apprehension thereof, I will pistol him
            with my own hands. With this resolution they cast anchor nigh the shore, at the distance
            of one quarter of a league from the town. The next day, before sunrising, they were all
            landed, being to the number of three-hundred-and-four-score men, well provided, and
            armed every one with a cutlass and one or two pistols ; and withal sufficient powder and
            bullet for 30 charges. Here, upon the shore, they all shook hands with one another in
            testimony of good courage, and began their march, L'Ollonais speaking these words to
            them : Come, my brothers, follow me, and have a good courage. They followed their way
            with a guide they had provided. But he, believing he led them well, brought them to the
            way which the Governor had obstructed with barricades. Through this not being able to
            pass, they went unto the other which was newly made in the wood among 96 THE PIRATES'
            STRATAGEM the mire, unto which the Spaniards could shoot at pleasure. Notwithstanding,
            the Pirates, being full of courage, cut down multitude of branches of trees, and threw
            them in the dirt upon the way, to the end they might not stick so fast in it. In the
            meanwhile, those of Gibraltar fired at them with their great guns so furiously that they
            could scarce hear or see one another through the noise and smoke. Being now past the
            wood, they came upon firm ground, where they met with a battery of 6 guns, which
            immediately the Spaniards discharged against them, all being loaded with small bullets
            and pieces of iron. After this, the Spaniards, sallying forth, set upon them with such
            fury as caused the Pirates to give way and retire, very few of them daring to advance
            towards the fort. They continued still firing against the Pirates, of whom they had
            already killed and wounded many. This made them go back to seek some other way through
            the middle of the wood ; but, the Spaniards having cut down many trees to hinder the
            pass- age, they could find none, and thus were forced to return unto that they had left.
            Here the Spaniards continued to fire as before ; neither would they sally out of their
            batteries to attack the Pirates any more. Hereby L'OUonais and his companions, not being
            able to grimp^ up the baskets of earth, were compelled to make use of an old stratagem —
            wherewith at last they deceived and overcame the Spaniards. L'OUonais retired suddenly
            with all his men, making show as if he fled. Hereupon the Spaniards, crying out : They
            flee, they flee ; let us follow them, sallied forth with great disorder, to pursue the
            fugitive Pirates. After they had drawn them some distance from their batteries, which
            was their only design, they turned upon them, unexpectedly with swords in hand, and
            killed above two hundred men. And thus fighting their way through those who remained
            alive, they possessed themselves of the batteries. The Spaniards that remained abroad
            gave themselves up for lost, and consequently took their flight unto the woods. The
            other part that was in the battery of eight guns surrendered themselves upon conditions

            THE PIRATES IN GIBRALTAR 97 of obtaining quarter for their lives. The Pirates, being now
            become masters of the whole town, pulled down the Spanish colours, and set up their own,
            taking prisoners at the same time as many as they could find. These they carried unto
            the great church, whither also they transferred many great guns, wherewith they raised a
            battery to defend themselves, fearing lest the Spaniards that were fled should rally
            more of their own party and come upon them again. But the next day, after they were all
            fortified, all their fears disappeared. They gathered all the dead, with intent to allow
            them burial, finding the number of above 500 Spaniards killed, besides those that were
            wounded within the town and those that died of their wounds in the woods, where they
            sought for refuge. Besides which, the Pirates had in their custody above 150 prisoners,
            and nigh 500 slaves, many women and children. Of their own companions the Pirates found
            only forty dead, and almost as many more wounded. Whereof the greatest part died
            afterwards, through the constitution of the air, which brought fevers and other
            accidents upon them. They put all the Spaniards that were slain into two great boats,
            and carrying them one-quart er-of-a-league within the sea, they sank the boats. These
            things being done, they gathered all the plate, household stuff, and merchandize they
            could rob or thought convenient to carry away. But the Spaniards who had anything as yet
            left unto them, hid it very carefully. Soon after, the Pirates, as if they were
            unsatisfied with the great riches they had gotten, began to seek for more goods and
            merchandize, not sparing those who lived in the fields, such as hunters and planters.
            They had scarce been eighteen days upon the place, when the greatest part of the
            prisoners they had taken died of hunger. For in the town very few provisions, especially
            of flesh, were to be found. Howbeit, they had some quantity of flour of meal, although
            perhaps something less than what was sufficient. But this the Pirates had taken into
            their custody to make bread for themselves. As to the swine, cows, sheep, and poultry
            that were found upon the place, they took them likewise for their own sustenance,
            without allowing any share thereof unto the poor prisoners. For these they only provided
            some small quantity of mules' and asses' flesh, which they killed for that purpose. And
            such as could not eat of that loathsome provision were constrained to die of hunger, as
            98 THE PIRATES IN GIBRALTAR many did, their stomachs not being accustomed to such
            unusual sustenance. Only some women were found, who were allowed better cheer by the
            Pirates, because they served them in their sensual dehghts, unto which those robbers are
            hugely given. Among those women, some had been forced, others were volun- teers ; though
            almost all had rather taken up that vice through poverty and hunger more than any other
            cause. Of the prisoners many also died under the torments they sustained, to make them
            confess where they had hidden their money or jewels. And of these, some, because they
            had none nor knew of none, and others for denying what they knew, endured such horrible
            deaths. Finally, after having been in possession of the town four entire weeks, they
            sent four of the prisoners remaining alive unto the Spaniards that were fled into the
            woods, demanding of them a ransom for not burning the town. The sum hereof they
            constituted 10,000 pieces-of-eight, which, unless it were sent unto them, they
            threatened to fire and reduce into ashes the whole village. For bringing in of this
            money they allowed them only the space of two days. These being past, and the Spaniards
            not having been able to gather so punctually such a sum, the Pirates began to set fire
            to many places of the town. Thus the inhabitants, perceiving the Pirates to be in
            earnest, begged of them tohelp to extinguish the fire ; and withal promised the ransom
            should be readily paid. The Pirates condescended to their petition, helping as much as
            they could to stop the progress of the fire. Yet, though they used the best endeavours
            they possibly could, one part of the town was ruined, especially the church belonging to
            the monastery, which was burnt even to dust. After they had received the sum
            above-mentioned, they carried on board their ships all the riches they had robbed,
            together with a great number of slaves which had not as yet paid their ransom. For all
            the prisoners had sums of money set upon them, and the slaves were also commanded to be
            re- deemed. Hence they returned to Maracaibo, where being arrived they found a general
            consternation in the whole city. Unto which they sent three or four prisoners to tell
            the gover- nor and inhabitants : They should bring them 30,000 pieces-of- eight on hoard
            their ships, for a ransom of their houses ; other- wise they should be entirely sacked
            anew and burnt. Among these debates a certain party of Pirates came on THE PIRATES
            DIVIDE THE SPOILS 99 shore to rob, and these carried away the images, the pictures, and
            bells of the great church, on board the fleet. The Span- iards, who were sent to demand
            of those who were fled the sum aforementioned, returned with orders to make some agree-
            ment with the Pirates. This they performed, and concluded with the Pirates they would
            give for their ransom and liberty the sum of 20,000 pieces-of-eight and 500 cows. The
            con- dition hereof being that they should commit no farther acts of hostility against
            any person, but should depart thence presently after pajmient of the money and cattle.
            The one and the other being delivered, they set sail with the whole fleet, causing great
            joy unto the inhabitants of Maracaibo to see themselves quit of this sort of people.
            Notwithstanding, three days after they resumed their fears and admiration, seeing the
            Pirates to appear again and re-enter the port they had left with all their ships. But
            these apprehensions soon vanished, by only hearing one of the Pirates' errand, who came
            on shore to tell them from L'OUonais : They should send him a skilful Pilot to conduct
            one of his greatest ships over the dangerous bank that lies at the entry of the lake.
            Which petition, or rather command, was instantly granted. /The Pirates had now been full
            two months in those towns, wherein they committed those cruel and insolent actions we
            have told you of. Departing therefore thence, they took their course towards the island
            Hispaniola, and arrived thither in eight days, casting anchor in a port called Isla de
            la Vaca, or Cow Island. This isle is inhabited by French Buccaneers, who most commonly
            sell the flesh they hunt unto Pirates and others who now and then put in there with
            intent of victualling or trading with them. Here they unladed the whole car- gazons^ of
            riches they had robbed — the usual storehouse of the Pirates being commonly under the
            shelter of the Buccaneers. Here also they made a dividend amongst them of all their
            prizes and gains, according to that order and degree which belonged unto every one, as
            hath been mentioned above. Having cast up the account and made exact calculation of all
            they had purchased, they found in ready money 260,000 pieces- of-eight. Whereupon, this
            being divided, every one received * Spanish for cargo : cf. " There should come in euery
            ship the fourth part of her cargason in money" — Hakluyt, Voyages [1583], vol. II, i, p.

            share in money, and also in pieces of silk, linen, and other commodities, the value of
            above loo pieces-of-eight. Those who had been wounded in this expedition received their
            part before all the rest ; I mean, such recompenses as I spoke of in the First Book, for
            the loss of their limbs which many sustained. Afterwards they weighed all the plate that
            was uncoined, reckoning after the rate of lo pieces-of-eight for every pound. The jewels
            were prized with much variety, either at too high or too low rates ; being thus
            occasioned by their own ignor- ance. This being done, every one was put to his oath
            again that he had not concealed anything nor substracted from the common stock. Hence
            they proceeded to the dividend of what shares belonged to such as were dead amongst
            them, either in battle or otherwise. These shares were given to their friends to be kept
            entire for them, and to be delivered in due time unto their nearest relations, or
            whomsoever should appear to be their lawful heirs. .^ The whole dividend being entirely
            finished, they set sail thence for the isle of Tortuga. Here they arrived one month
            after, to the great joy of most that were upon the island. For, as to the common
            Pirates, in three weeks they had scarce any money left them, having spent it all in
            things of httle value, or at play either of cards or dice. Here also arrived, not long
            before them, two French ships laden with wine and brandy and other things of this kind ;
            whereby these liquors, at the arrival of the Pirates, were sold indifferent cheap. But
            this lasted not long ; for soon after they were enhanced extremely, a gallon of brandy
            being sold for 4 pieces-of-eight. The Governor of the island bought of the Pirates the
            whole cargo of the ship laden with cacao, giving them for that rich com- modity scarce
            the twentieth part of what it was worth. Thus they made shift to lose and spend the
            riches they had got in much less time than they were purchased by robbing. The taverns
            and stews, according to the custom of Pirates, got the greatest part thereof, insomuch
            that soon after they were constrained to seek more by the same unlawful means they had
            obtained the preceding. CHAPTER III L'Ollonais makes new preparations to take the city
            of St James dc Leon ; as also that of Nicaragua, where he miserably perishes L'Ollonais
            had got himself very great esteem and repute at Tortuga by this last voyage, by reason
            he brought them home such considerable profit. And now he needed take no great care how
            to gather men to serve under his colours, seeing more came in voluntarily to proffer
            their service unto him than he could employ, every one reposing such great confidence in
            his conduct for seeking their fortunes that they judged it a matter of the greatest
            security imaginable to expose them- selves in his company to the hugest dangers that
            might possibly occur. He resolved, therefore, for a second voyage, to go with his
            officers and soldiers towards the parts of Nicaragua, and pillage there as many towns as
            he could meet. Having published his new preparations, he had all his men together at the
            time appointed, being about the number of 700, more or less. Of these he put 300 on
            board the ship he took at Maracaibo, and the rest in other vessels of lesser burden,
            which were five more ; so that the whole number were in all six ships. The first port
            they went unto was in the island of Hispaniola, to a place called Bayala, where they
            determined to victual the fleet and take in provisions. This being done, they set sail
            thence, and steered their course to a port called Matamana, lying on the South side of
            the isle of Cuba. Their intent was to take here all the canoes they could meet, these
            coasts being frequented by a huge number of fisher- men of tortoises, who carry them
            thence unto Havana. They took as many of the said canoes, to the great grief of those
            miserable people, as they thought necessary for their designs. For they had great
            necessity of these small bottoms, by reason the port whither they designed to go was not
            of depth sufficient I02 REACHES PUERTO CAVALLO to bear ships of any burden. Hence they
            took their course towards the cape called Gracias k Dios, situate upon the continent in
            latitude fifteen degrees North, at the distance of one hundred leagues from the island
            De los Pinos. But, being out at sea, they were taken with a sad and tedious calm, and by
            the agitation of the waves alone were thrown into the Gulf of Honduras. Here they
            laboured very much to regain what they had lost, but all in vain ; both the waters in
            their course and the winds being contrary to their endeavours. Besides that, the ship
            wherein L'Ollonais was embarked could not follow the rest ; and, what was worse, they
            wanted already provisions. Hereupon they were forced to put into the first port or bay
            they could reach, to revictual their fleet. Thus they entered with their canoes into a
            river called Xagua, inhabited by Indians, whom they totally robbed and destroyed ; they
            finding amongst their goods great quantity of millet, many hogs and hens. Not contented
            with what they had done, they determined to remain there until the bad weather was over,
            and to pillage all the towns and villages lying along the coast of the gulf. Thus they
            passed from one place to another, seeking as yet more provisions, by reason they had not
            what they wanted for the accomplishment of their designs. Having searched and rifled
            many vilages, where they found no great matter, they came at last to Puerto Cavallo. In
            this port the Spaniards have two several storehouses, which serve to keep the
            merchandize that are brought from the inner parts of the country until the arrival of
            the ships. There was in the port at that occasion a Spanish ship mounted with four-and-
            twenty guns and sixteen pedreros'^ or mortar-pieces. This ship was immediately seized by
            the Pirates ; and then, drawing nigh the shore, they landed and burnt the two
            storehouses, with all the rest of the houses belonging to the place. Many inhabitants
            likewise they took prisoners and committed upon them the most insolent and inhuman
            cruelties that ever heathens invented, putting them to the cruellest tortures they could
            imagine or devise. It was the custom of L'Ollonais 1 Pedrero (Spanish), a swivel-gun,
            used for firing off stones, scraps of iron, etc. Cf. Barrgt, Theorie of Warres [1598]:

            Patarcro. Cf. Angelo and Carli, Congo [1700 ; in Pinkerton's Voyages. XVI, p. 180] : '
            The ship carried fifty guns, four-and-twenty patare- roes, and other necessaries,'
            L'OLLONAIS* INHUMANITIES 103 that, having tormented any persons and they not confessing,
            he would instantly cut them in pieces with his anger, and pull out their tongues ;
            desiring to do the same, if possible, to every Spaniard in the world. Oftentimes it
            happened that some of these miserable prisoners, being forced thereunto by the rack,
            would promise to discover the places where the fugitive Spaniards lay hidden ; which
            being not able afterwards to perform, they were put to more enormous and cruel deaths
            than they who were dead before. The prisoners being all dead and annihilated (excepting
            only two, whom they reserved to show them what they desired), they marched hence to the
            town of San Pedro, or St Peter, distant 10 or 12 leagues from Puerto Cavallo, having in
            their company 300 men, whom L'OUonais led, and leaving behind him Moses van Vin for his
            Heutenant to govern the rest in his absence. Being come 3 leagues upon their way, they
            met with a troop of Spaniards, who lay in ambuscade for their coming. These they set
            upon with all the courage imaginable, and at last totally defeated, howbeit they behaved
            themselves very manfully at the beginning of the fight. But, not being able to resist
            the fury of the Pirates, they were forced to give way and save themselves by flight,
            leaving many Pirates dead upon the place and wounded, as also some of their own party
            maimed by the way. These L'OUonais put to death without mercy, having asked them what
            questions he thought fit for his purpose. There were still remaining some few prisoners
            who were not wounded. These were asked by L'OUonais if any more Spaniards did he farther
            on in ambuscade : unto whom they answered, there were. Then he commanded them to be
            brought before him, one by one, and asked if there was no other way to be found to the
            town but that. This he did out of a design to excuse, if possible, those ambuscades. But
            they all constantly answered him, they knew none. Having asked them all, and finding
            they could show him no other way, L'OUonais grew outrageously passionate ; insomuch that
            he drew his cutlass, and with it cut open the breast of one of those poor Spaniards,
            and, pulling out his heart with his sacrilegious hands, began to bite and gnaw it with
            his teeth like a ravenous wolf, saying to the rest : / will serve you all alike if you
            show me not another way. I04 L'OLLONAIS' INHUMANITIES Hereupon those miserable wretches
            promised to show him another way ; but withal they told him it was extremely difficult
            and laborious. Thus, to satisfy that cruel tyrant, they began to lead him and his army.
            But finding it not for his purpose, even as they told him, he was constrained unto
            return to the former way, swearing with great choler and indignation : Mort Dieu, les
            Espagnols me le payeront ! {By God's death, the Spaniards shall pay me for this ! ) .
            The next day he fell into another ambuscade, the which he assaulted with such horrible
            fury that in less than an hour's time he routed the Spaniards, and killed the greatest
            part of them. The Spaniards were persuaded that by these ambus- cades they should better
            be able to destroy the Pirates, assault- ing them by degrees ; and for this reason had
            posted them- selves in several places. At last he met with a third ambus- cade, where
            was placed a party of Spaniards both stronger and to greater advantage than the former.
            Yet, notwithstanding, the Pirates, by throwing with their hands little fireballs in
            great number, and continuing to do so for some time, forced this party, as well as the
            preceding, to flee ; and this with such great loss of men as that, before they could
            reach the town, the greatest part of the Spaniards were either killed or wounded. There
            was but one path which led to the town. This path was very well barricaded with good
            defences ; and the rest of the town round about was planted with certain shrubs or trees
            named raqueltes, very full of thorns and these very sharp- pointed. This sort of
            fortification seemed stronger than the triangles which are used in Europe, when an army
            is of necessity to pass by the place of an enemy, it being almost impossible for the
            Pirates to traverse those shrubs. The Spaniards that were posted behind the said
            defences, seeing the Pirates come, began to shoot at them with their great guns. But
            these, perceiving them ready to fire, used to stoop down, and, when the shot was made,
            fall upon the defendants with fireballs in hands and naked swords, killing with these
            weapons many of the town. Yet, notwithstanding, not being able to advance any farther,
            they were constrained to retire for the first time. Afterwards they returned to the
            attack again, with fewer men than before ; and, observing not to shoot till they were
            very near, they gave the Spaniards a charge so dexterously that with every shot they
            killed an enemjy. ^^f^: " L'OUonais . . . drew his cutlass, and with it cut open the

            SEEK PROVISIONS 107 The attack continuing thus eager on both sides till night, the
            Spaniards were compelled to hang forth a white flag, in token of truce and that they
            desired to come to a parley. The only conditions they required for delivering the town
            were : That the Pirates should give the inhabitants quarter for two hours. This short
            space of time they demanded, with intent to carry away and abscond as much of their
            goods and riches as they could, as also to flee to some other neighbouring town. Upon
            the agreement of this article they entered the town, and continued there the two hours
            above-mentioned, without committing the least act of hostility or causing any trouble to
            the inhabitants. But no sooner that time was passed than L'OUonais ordered the
            inhabitants should be followed and robbed of all they had carried away ; and not only
            goods, but their persons, likewise, to be made all prisoners. Notwith- standing, the
            greatest part of their merchandize and goods were in such manner absconded as the
            Pirates could not find them ; they meeting only a few leathern sacks that were filled
            with anil, or indigo^. Having stayed at this town some few days, and according to their
            usual customs committed there most horrid insolences, they at last quitted the place,
            carrying away with them all that they possibly could, and reducing the town totally into
            ashes. Being come to the seaside, where they left a party of their own comrades, they
            found these had busied themselves in cruizing upon the fishermen that lived thereabouts
            or came that way from the river of Guatemala. In this river also was expected a ship
            that was to come from Spain. Finally they resolved to go towards the islands that lie on
            the other side of the gulf, there to cleanse and careen their vessels. But in the
            meanwhile they left two canoes before the coast, or rather the mouth of the river of
            Guatemala, to the intent they should take the ship which, as I said before, was expected
            from Spain. But their chief intention of going to those islands was to seek provisions,
            as knowing the tortoises of those places are very excellent and pleasant food. As soon
            as they arrived there, they divided into troops, each party choosing a fit post for that
            fishery. Every one of them undertook to knit a net ^ The West Indian indigo plant,
            Indigo/era anil. Cf. Linschoten, Voyages, Bk. i, vol. i, p. 6i (ed. 1885) : ' annell or
            indigo groweth onely in Cambaia.' io8 ISLANDS OF PITCH. AMBER with the rinds of certain
            trees called in those parts macoa. Of these rinds they make also ropes and cables for
            the service of ships ; insomuch that no vessel can be in need of such things whensoever
            they can but find the said trees. There are also in those parts many places where they
            find pitch^, which is gathered thereabouts in great abundance. The quantity hereof is so
            great that, running down the sea-coasts being melted by the heat of the sun, it congeals
            in the water into great heaps, and represents the shape of small islands. This pitch is
            not like unto that we have in the countries of Europe, but is hugely like, both in
            colour and shape, that froth of the sea which is called by the naturalists bitumen. But
            in my judgment this matter is nothing else but wax, which stormy weather has cast into
            the sea, being part of that huge quantity which in the neighbouring territories is made
            by the bees. Thus from places far distant from the sea it is also brought to the sea-
            coast by the winds and rolling waves of great rivers ; being likewise mingled with sand,
            and having the smell of black amber, such as is sent us from the Orient. In those parts
            are found great quantities of the said bees, who make their honey in trees ; whence it
            happens that the honey-combs being fixed unto the bodies of the trees, when tempests
            arise they are torn away, and by the fury of the winds carried into the sea, as has been
            said before. Some naturalists are willing to say that between the honey and the wax is
            made a separation by means of the salt water, whence proceeds also the good amber. This
            opinion is rendered the more probable because the said amber, being found and tasted, it
            affords the like taste as wax does. But now, returning to my discourse, I shall let you
            know that the Pirates made in those islands all the haste to equip their vessels they
            could possibly, by reason they had news the Spanish ship which they expected was come.
            They spent some time in cruizing upon the coasts of Yucatan, whereabouts inhabit many
            Indians, who seek for the amber above-mentioned in those seas. But seeing we are come to
            this place, I shall here, by the by, make some short remarks on the manner of living of
            these Indians, and the divine worship which they practice. * The pitch lake of La Brea,
            Trinidad, is celebrated. Asphalt is an important article of export from Trinidad at the
            present day. THE INDIANS OF YUCATAN 109 The Indians of tlie coasts of Yucatan have now
            been above one hundred years under the dominion of the Spaniards. Unto this nation they
            performed all manner of service ; for, whensoever any of them had need of a slave or
            servant, they sent to seek one of these Indians to serve them as long as they pleased.
            By the Spaniards they were initiated at first in the principles of Christian faith and
            religion. Being thus made a part of Christianity, they used to send them every Sunday
            and holiday through the whole year a priest to perform divine service among them.
            Afterwards, for what reasons are not known, but certainly through evil temptations of
            the Father of Idolatry, the Devil, they suddenly cast off Christian religion again, and
            abandoned the true divine worship, beating withal and abusing the priest that was sent
            them. This provoked the Spaniards to punish them according to their deserts, which they
            did by casting many of the chiefest of these Indians into prison. Every one of those
            barbarians had, and has still, a god to himself whom he serves and worships. It is a
            thing that deserves all admiration, to consider how they use in this particular a child
            that is newly born into the world. As soon as this is issued from the womb of the
            mother, they carry it to the temple. Here they make a circle or hole, which they fill
            with ashes, without mingling anything else with them. Upon this heap of ashes they place
            the child naked, leaving it there a whole night alone, not without great danger ; nobody
            daring to come near it. In the meanwhile the temple is open on all sides, to the intent
            all sorts of beasts may freely come in and out. The next day the father and relations of
            the infant return thither, to see if the track or step of any animal appears to be
            printed in the ashes. Not finding any, they leave the child there until some beast has
            approached the infant and left behind him the mark of his feet. Unto this animal,
            whatsoever it be, they consecrate the creature newly born as unto its god, which he is
            bound to worship and serve all his life, esteeming the said beast as his patron and
            protector in all cases of danger or necessity. They offer unto their gods sacrifices of
            fire, wherein they burn a certain gum called by them copal^, whose smoke affords a very
            delicious smell. When the infant is grown up, the parents thereof tell him and show him
            * Spanish copal : a resin. Cf. Frampton, Joyfull Ncwes [1577] : ' The copal is a rosine
            very white.' no MARRIAGE CUSTOMS OF INDIANS whom he ought to worship, serve, and honour
            as his own proper god. This being known, he goes to the temple, where he makes offerings
            unto the said beast. Afterwards, if in the course of his Ufe any one has injured him or
            any evil happens to him, he complains thereof to that beast, and sacrifices unto it for
            revenge. Whence many times comes that those who have done the injury of which he
            complains are found to be bitten, killed, or otherwise hurt by such animals. After this
            superstitious and idolatrous manner do live those miserable and ignorant Indians that
            inhabit all the islands of the Gulf of Honduras, as also many of them that dwell upon
            the continent of Yucatan. In the territories of which country are found most excellent
            ports for the safety of ships, where those Indians most commonly love to build their
            houses. These people are not very faithful one to another, and likewise use strange
            ceremonies at their marriages. Whensoever any one pretends to marry a young damsel, he
            first applies himself to her father or nearest relation. He then examines him very
            exactly concerning the manner of cultivating their plantations and other things at his
            pleasure. Having satisfied the ques- tions that were put to him by the father-in-law, he
            gives the young man a bow and arrow. With these things he repairs to the young maid, and
            presents her with a garland of green leaves, interweaved with sweet-smelling flowers.
            This she is obliged to put upon her head, and lay aside that which she wore before that
            time ; it being the custom of the country that all virgins go perpetually crowned with
            flowers. This garland being received and put upon the head, every one of the relations
            and friends go to advise with others among themselves, whether that marriage will be
            useful and of likely happiness or not. Afterwards the aforesaid relations and friends
            meet together at the house of the damsel's father, and they drink of a certain liquor
            made of maize, or Indian wheat. And here before the whole company the father gives his
            daughter in marriage unto the bridegroom. The next day the newly-married bride comes to
            her mother, and in her presence pulls off the garland and tears it in pieces, with great
            cries and bitter lamentations, according to the custom of the country. Many other things
            I could relate at large of the manner of living and customs of those Indians ; but these
            I shall omit, thereby to follow my discourse. CAPTURE OF THE SPANISH SHIP 1 1 1 Our
            Pirates, therefore, had many canoes of the Indians in the isle of Sambale, five leagues
            distant from the coasts of Yucatan. In the aforesaid island is found great quantity of
            amber, but more especially when any storm arises from to- wards the East, whence the
            waves bring many things and very different. Through this sea no vessels can pass, unless
            very small, the waters being too shallow. In the lands that are surrounded by this sea
            is found huge quantity of Campeche wood^ and other things of this kind, that serve for
            the art of dyeing, which occasions them to be much esteemed in Europe, and doubtless
            would be much more, in case we had the skill and science of the Indians, who are so
            industrious as to make a dye or tincture that never changes its colour nor fades away.
            After that the Pirates had been in that gulf three entire months, they received advice
            that the Spanish ship was come. Hereupon they hastened unto the port, where the ship lay
            at anchor unlading the merchandize it brought, with design to assault her as soon as it
            was possible. But, before this attempt, they thought it convenient to send away some of
            their boats from the mouth of the river, to seek for a small vessel which was expected,
            having notice that she was very richly laden, the greatest part of the cargo being
            plate, indigo, and cochineal. In the meanwhile the people of the ship that was in the
            port had notice given that the Pirates designed upon them. Hereupon they prepared all
            things very well for the defence of the said vessel, which was mounted with 42 guns, had
            many arms on board and other necessaries, together with 130 fighting men. Unto
            L'Ollonias all this seemed but little ; and thus he assaulted her with great courage,
            his own ship carrying only 22 guns, and having no more than a small saeiia, or flyboat,
            for help. But the Spaniards defended themselves after such manner as they forced the
            Pirates to retire. Notwithstanding, while the smoke of the powder continued very thick,
            as amidst a dark fog or mist, they sent four canoes very well manned, and boarded the
            ship with great agility, whereby they compelled the Spaniards to surrender. The ship
            being taken, they found not in her what they thought, as being already almost wholly
            unladed. All the * Logwood, named from Campeachy on the West coast of Yucatan. Cf. " The
            chiefest merchandize which they lade there in small frigats is a certeine wood called

            SPLITTING UP OF THE PIRATES treasure they here got consisted only in fifty bars of iron,
            a small parcel of paper, some earthen jars full of wine, and other things of this kind :
            all of small importance. /'Presently after, L'Ollonais called a council of the whole
            fleet, wherein he told them he intended to go to Guatemala. Upon this point they divided
            into several sentiments ; some of them liking the proposal very well, and others
            disliking it as much — especially a certain party of them, who were but new in those
            exercises of piracy, and who had imagined at their setting forth from Tortuga that
            pieces-of-eight were gathered as easily as pears from a tree. But, having found at last
            most things contrary to their expectation, they quitted the fleet, and returned whence
            they set out. Others, on the contrary, affirmed they had rather die of hunger than
            return home with- out a great deal of money. / But the major part of the company,
            judging the propounded voyage little fit for their purpose, separated from L'Ollonais
            and the rest. Among these was ringleader one Moses Vanclein, who was captain of the ship
            taken at Puerto Cavallo. This fellow took his course towards Tortuga, designing to
            cruize to and fro in those seas. With him also joined another comrade of his own, by
            name Pierre le Picard, who, seeing the rest to leave L'Ollonais, thought fit to do the
            same. These runaways having thus parted company, steered their course homewards,
            coasting along the continent till they came at last unto Costa Rica. Here they landed a
            strong party of men nigh unto the river of Veraguas, and marched in good order unto the
            town of the same name. This place they took and totally pillaged, notwithstanding that
            the Spaniards made a strong and warlike resistance. They brought away some of the
            inhabitants as prisoners, with] all that they had robbed, which was of no great
            importance, the reason hereof being the poverty of the place, which exercises no manner
            of trade than only working in the mines, where some of the inhabitants do constantly
            attend. Yet no other persons seek for the gold than only slaves. These they compel to
            dig, whether they live or die, and wash the earth that is taken out in the neighbouring
            rivers ; where oftentimes they find pieces of gold as big as peas. Finally, the pirates
            found in this robbery no greater value than 7 or 8 pounds weight of gold. Hereupon they
            returned back, giving over the design they had to go farther on to the town of INDIANS
            OF DE LAS PERTAS 113 Nata, situated upon the coasts of the South Sea. Hitherto they
            designed to march, knowing the inhabitants to be rich merchants, who had their slaves at
            work in the mines of Veraguas. But from this enterprize they were deterred by the
            multitude of Spaniards whom they saw gather on all sides to fall upon them ; whereof
            they had timely advice before- hand. L'OlIonais, thus abandoned by his companions,
            remained alone in the Gulf of Honduras, by reason his ship was too great to get out at
            the time of the reflux of those seas, which the smaller vessels could do more easily.
            There he sustained great want of all sorts of provisions, insomuch as they were
            constrained to go ashore every day to seek wherewithal to maintain themselves. And, not
            finding anything else, they were forced to kill monkeys and other animals such as they
            could find, for their sustenance. At last having found, in the latitude of the Cape of
            Gracias ^ Dios, certain little islands called De las Pertas, here, nigh unto these
            isles, his ship fell upon a bank of sand, where it stuck so fast as no art could be
            found to get her off into deep water again, notwithstanding they unladed all the guns,
            iron, and other weighty things as much as possibly they could : but all they could do
            was to little or no effect. Hereupon they were necessitated to break the ship in pieces,
            and with some of the planks and nails build themselves a boat, wherewith to get away
            from those islands. Thus they began their work ; and, while they are employed about it,
            I shall pass to describe succinctly the isles aforementioned and their inhabitants. The
            islands called De las Pertas are inhabited by Indians, who are properly savages, as not
            having at any time known or conversed with any civil people. They are tall in stature
            and very nimble in running, which they perform almost as fast as horses. At diving also
            in the sea they are very dexter- ous and hardy. From the bottom of the sea I saw them
            take up an anchor that weighed 600 pound, by tying a cable unto it with great dexterity
            and pulling it from a rock. They use no other arms than such as are made of wood,
            without any iron, unless that some instead therefore do fix a crocodile-tooth, which
            serves for a point. They have neither bows nor arrows among them, as other Indians have
            ; but their common weapon is a sort of lances, that are long a fathom and a half. 114
            INDIANS OF DE LAS PERTAS In these islands there are many plantations surrounded with
            woods, whence they gather great abundance of fruits. Such are potatoes, bananas,
            racoven, ananas, and many others, which the constitution of the soil affords. Nigh unto
            these plantations they have no houses to dwell in, as in other places of the Indies.
            Some are of opinion that these Indians eat human flesh, which seems to be confirmed by
            what happened when L'Ollonais was there. Two of his companions, the one being a
            Frenchman and the other a Spaniard, went into the woods, where, having straggled up and
            down some while, they met with a troop of Indians that began to pursue them. They
            defended themselves as well as they could with their swords, but at last were forced to
            flee. This the Frenchman performed with great agility : but the Spaniard, being not so
            swift as his companion, was taken by those barbarians, and heard of no more. Some days
            after, they attempted to go into the woods to see what was become of their companion.
            Unto this effect twelve Pirates set forth very well armed, amongst whom was the
            Frenchman, who conducted them, and shewed them the place where he left his companion.
            Here they found, nigh unto the place, that the Indians had kindled fire ; and, at a
            small distance thence, they found the bones of the said Spaniard very well roasted.
            Hence they inferred that they had roasted the miserable Spaniard, of whom they found
            more, some pieces of flesh ill scraped off from the bones and one hand, which had only
            two fingers remaining. They marched farther on, seeking for Indians. Of these they found
            a great number together, who endeavoured to escape, seeing the Pirates so strong and
            well armed. But they overtook some of them, and brought on board their ships five men
            and four women. With these they used all the means they could invent to make themselves
            to be understood and gain their affections, giving them certain small trifles, as
            knives, beads, and the like things. They gave them also victuals and drink, but nothing
            of either would they taste. It was also observable that all the while they were
            prisoners on board the ships, they spoke not one word to each other among themselves.
            Thus the Pirates, seeing these poor Indians were much afraid of them, presented them
            again with some small things, and let them go. When they departed, they made signs,
            giving them to understand they would come DISAPPEARANCE OF THE INDIANS 115 again. But
            they soon forgot their benefactors, and were never heard nor seen more. Neither could
            any notice afterwards be had of these Indians or any others in the whole island after
            that time ; which occasioned the Pirates to suspect that both those that were taken, and
            all the rest of the island, did ail swim away by night to some other little neighbouring
            islands, especially considering they could never set eyes on any Indian more ; neither
            was there ever seen any boat or other vessel in the whole circumference of the island.
            In the meanwhile the Pirates were very desirous to see their long-boat finished, which
            they were building with the timber of the ship that stuck upon the sands. Yet,
            considering their work would be long, they began to cultivate some pieces of ground.
            Here they sowed French beans, which came to maturity in six weeks time, and many other
            fruits. They had good provision of Spanish wheat, bananas, racoven, and other things.
            With the wheat they made bread, and baked it in portable ovens which they had brought
            with them to this effect. Thus they feared not hunger in those desert places. After this
            manner they employed themselves for the space of five or six months. Which time being
            passed, and the long-boat finished, they determined to go unto the river of Nicaragua,
            to see if they could take some few canoes, and herewith return unto the said islands and
            fetch away their companions that remained behind, by reason the boat they had built was
            not capable of transporting so many men together. Hereupon, to avoid any disputes that
            might arise, they cast lots among themselves, determining thereby who should go, or
            stay, in the island. The lot fell only upon one half of the people of the lost vessel,
            who embarked upon the long-boat they had built, and also the skiff which they had
            before, the other half remaining on shore. L'Ollonais, having set sail, arrived in a few
            days at the mouth of the river of Nicaragua. Here suddenly his ill- fortune assailed
            him, which of long time had been reserved for him as a punishment due unto the multitude
            of horrible crimes which in his licentious and wicked life he had committed. Here he met
            with both Spaniards and Indians, who jointly together set upon him and his companions,
            and used them so roughly that the greatest part of the Pirates were killed upon the
            place. L'Ollonais, with those that remained ahve, had much ii6 L'OLLONAIS BUTCHERED ado
            to escape on board their boats aforementioned. Yet, not- withstanding this great loss of
            men, he resolved not to return to seek those he had left at the Isle of Pertas without
            taking some boats, such as he looked for. Unto this effect he deter- mined to go farther
            on to the coasts of Cartagena, with design to seek for canoes. But God Almighty, the
            time of His Divine justice being now already come, had appointed the Indians of Darien
            to be the instruments and executioners thereof. The Indians of Darien are esteemed as
            bravos, or wild savage Indians, by the neighbouring Spaniards, who never could reduce
            them to civility. Hither L'Ollonais came (being rather brought by his evil conscience
            that cried for punishment of his crimes), thinking to act in that country his former
            cruelties. But the Indians within a few days after his arrival took him prisoner and
            tore him in pieces ahve, throwing his body Umb by limb into the fire, and his ashes into
            the air, to the intent no trace or memory might remain of such an infamous, inhuman
            creature. One of his companions gave me an exact account of the aforesaid tragedy,
            affirming withal that he himself had escaped the same punishment, not without the
            greatest of difficulties . He believed also that many of his comrades who were taken
            prisoners in that encounter by the Indians of Darien were after the same manner as their
            cruel captain torn in pieces and burned ahve. Thus ends the history of the life and
            miserable death of that infernal wretch L'Ollonias, who, full of horrid, execrable, and
            enormous deeds, and also debtor to so much innocent blood, died by cruel and butcherly
            hands, such as his own were in the course of his hfe. Those that remained in the island
            De las Pertas, waiting for the return of them who got away only to their great
            misfortune, hearing no news of their captain nor companions, at last embarked themselves
            upon the ship of a certain Pirate who happened to pass that way. This fellow was come
            from Jamaica with intent to land at the Cape of Gracias a Dios, and hence to mount the
            river with his canoes and take the city of Cartagena. These two parcels of Pirates being
            now joined together were infinitely gladded at the presence and society of one another.
            Those because they found themselves de- livered from their miseries, poverty, and
            necessities, wherein now they had lived the space of ten entire months — these, REDUCED
            TO EXTREMITIES 117 because they were now considerably strengthened, whereby to effect
            with greater satisfaction their intended designs. Hereupon, as soon as they were arrived
            unto the aforesaid Cape of Gracias i Dios, they all put themselves into canoes, and with
            these vessels mounted the river, being in number 500 men ; leaving only 5 or 6 persons
            in every ship to keep them. They took no provisions with them, as being persuaded they
            should find everywhere sufficient. ]3ut these their own hopes were found totally vain,
            as not being grounded in God Almighty. For He ordained it so that the Indians, having
            perceived their coming, were all fled before them, not leaving in their houses nor
            plantations, which for the most part do border upon the sides of rivers, anything of
            necessary provisions or victuals. Here- by in few days after they had quitted their
            ships, they were reduced to such necessity and hunger as nothing could be more extreme.
            Notwithstanding, the hopes they had conceived of making their fortunes very soon did
            animate them for the present, being contented in this affliction with a few green herbs,
            such as they could gather as they went upon the banks of the river. Yet all this courage
            and vigour of mind could not last above a fortnight. After which, their hearts, as well
            as their bodies, began to fail for hunger ; insomuch as they found themselves
            constrained to quit the river and betake themselves unto the woods, seeking out some
            small villages where they might find relief for their necessity. But all was in vain ;
            for, having ranged up and down the woods for some days without finding the least comfort
            to their hungry desires, they were forced to return again unto the river. Where being
            come, they thought it convenient to descend unto the sea-coasts where they had left
            their ships, not being able to find in the present enterprize what they sought for. In
            this laborious journey they were reduced to such extremity that many of them devoured
            their own shoes, the sheaths of their swords, knives, and other things of this kind,
            being almost ravenous, and fully desirous to meet some Indians, intending to sacrifice
            them unto their teeth. At last they arrived at the coast of the sea, where they found
            some comfort and relief to their former miseries, and also means to seek more. Yet,
            notwithstanding, the greatest part of them perished through faintness and other diseases
            con- tracted by hunger ; whicjh gccasioned also the remaining part ii8 END OF THE
            EXPEDITION to disperse — till at last by degrees many or most of them fell into the same
            pit that L'OUonais did. Of him and of his companions I have hitherto given my reader a
            compendious narrative, which now I shall continue with the actions and exploits of
            Captain Henry Morgan, who may not undeservedly be called the second L'OUonais, as not
            being unlike or inferior unto him either in achievements against the Spaniards or in
            robberies of many innocent people. CHAPTKR IV Of the origin and descent of Captain Henry
            Morgan — his exploits and a continuation of the most remarkable actions of his life
            Captain Henry Morgan was born in the kingdom of England, and there in the principahty of
            Wales. His father was a rich yeoman, or farmer, and of good quality in that country,
            even as most who bear that name in Wales are known to be. ^lorgan, being as yet young,
            had no incHnations to follow the calling of his father ; and therefore left his country
            and came towards the sea-coasts to seek some other employ more suitable to his humour,
            that aspired to some- thing else. There he found entertainment in a certain port where
            several ships lay at anchor, that were bound for the isle of Barbados. With these ships
            he resolved to go in the service of one who, according to what is commonly practised in
            those parts by the English and other nations, sold him as soon as he came on shore. He
            served his time at Barbados, and when he had obtained his liberty, thence transferred
            himself unto the island of Jamaica, there to seek new fortunes. Here he found two
            vessels of Pirates that were ready to go to sea. Being destitute of employ, he put
            himself into one of these ships, with intent to follow the exercises of that sort of
            people. He learned in a little while their manner of living ; and so exactly that,
            having performed three or four voyages with some profit and good success, he agreed with
            some of his comrades, who had gotten by the same voyages a small parcel of money, to
            join stocks and buy a ship. The vessel being bought, they unanimously chose him to be
            the Captain and Commander thereof. / With this ship, soon after, he set forth from
            Jamaica to cruize upon the coasts of Campeche, in which voyage he had the 119 I20
            CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN fortune to take several ships, with which he returned trium- phant
            to the same island. Here he found at the same time an old Pirate named Mansvelt (of whom
            we have already made mention in the First Part of this book), who was then busied in
            equipping a considerable fleet of ships, with design to land upon the Continent and
            pillage whatever came in his way. Mansvelt, seeing Captain Morgan return with so many
            prizes, judged him from his actions to be of undaunted courage, and hereupon was moved
            to choose him for his Vice-Admiral in that expedition. Thus, having fitted out fifteen
            ships between great and small, they set sail from Jamaica with 500 men, both Walloons
            and French. With this fleet they arrived not long after at the isle of St Catharine,
            situated nigh unto the continent of Costa Rica, in the latitude of twelve-degrees-
            and-a-half North, and distant thirty-five leagues from the river of Chagre, between
            North and South. Here they made their first descent, landing most of their men presently
            after. Being now come to try their arms and fortune, they in a short while forced the
            garrison that kept the island to surrender and deliver into their hands all the forts
            and castles belonging thereunto. All these they instantly demolished, reserving only
            one, wherein they placed one hundred men of their own party and all the slaves they had
            taken from the Spaniards. With the rest of their men they marched unto another small
            island nigh unto that of St Catharine, and adjoining so near unto it that with a bridge
            they could get over. In few days they made a bridge, and passed thither, conveying also
            over it all the pieces of ordnance which they had taken upon the great island. Having
            ruined and destroyed, with sword and fire, both the islands, leaving what orders were
            necessary at the castle above-mentioned, they put forth to sea again with the Spaniards
            they had taken prisoners. Yet these they set on shore, not long after, upon the firm
            land nigh unto a place called Porto Bello. After this they began* to cruize upon the
            coasts of Costa Rica, till that finally they came unto the river of Colla, designing to
            rob and pillage all the towns they could find in those parts, and afterwards to pass
            unto the village of Nata, to do the same. The President, or Governor, of Panama, having
            had advice of the arrival of these Pirates and the hostihties they committed everywhere,
            thought it his duty to set forth tQ their encounter LE SIEUR SIMON 121 with a body of
            men. His coming caused the Pirates to retire suddenly with all speed and care,
            especially seeing the whole country alarmed at their arrival, and that their designs
            were known and consequently could be of no great effect at that present. Hereupon they
            returned unto the isle of St Catharine, to visit the hundred men they had left in
            garrison there. The Governor of these men was a certain Frenchman named Le Sieur Simon,
            who behaved himself very well in that charge, while Mansvelt was absent ; insomuch that
            he had put the great island in a very good posture of defence, and the little one he had
            caused to be cultivated with many fertile plantations, which were sufficient to
            revictual the whole fleet with provisions and fruits, not only for present refresh- ment
            but also in case of a new voyage. Mansvelt 's inclinations were very much bent to keep
            these two islands in perpetual possession, as being very commodious and profitably
            situated for the use of the Pirates, chiefly because they were so near unto the Spanish
            dominions and easily to be defended against them ; as I shall represent in the Third
            Part of this history more at large, in a copper plate delineated for this purpose.
            Hereupon Mansvelt determined to return unto Jamaica, with design to send some recruit to
            the isle of St Catharine, that, in case of any invasion of the Spaniards, the Pirates
            might be provided for a defence. As soon as he arrived, he propounded his mind and
            intentions unto the Governor of that island ; but he liked not the propositions of
            Mansvelt, fearing lest by granting such things he should displease his master, the King
            of England, besides that, giving him the men he desired, and other necessaries for that
            purpose, he must of necessity diminish and weaken the forces of that island whereof he
            was Governor. Mansvelt seeing the unwillingness of the Governor of Jamaica, and that of
            his own accord he could not compass what he desired, with the same intent and designs
            went to the isle of Tortuga. But there, before he could accom- plish his desires or put
            in execution what was intended, death suddenly surprised him and put a period to his
            wicked life ; all things hereby remaining in suspense, until the occasion^ which I shall
            hereafter relate. Le Sieur Simon, who remained at the isle of St Catharine in quality of
            Governor thereof, receiving no news from Mansvelt, his admirai, was grea^tlv impatient
            and desicQUS to know what. 122 RETAKING OF ST CATHARINE might be the cause thereof. In
            the meanwhile Don John Perez de Guzman, being newly come to the government of Costa
            Rica, thought it no ways convenient for the interest of the King of Spain that that
            island should remain in the hands of the Pirates. And hereupon he equipped a
            considerable fleet, which he sent unto the said island to retake it. But, before he came
            to use any great violence, he wrote a letter to Le Sieur Simon, wherein he gave him to
            understand, if he would surrender the island unto his Catholic Majesty, he should be
            very well rewarded ; but, in case of refusal, severely punished when he had forced him
            to do it. Le Sieur Simon, seeing no appearance or probability of being able to defend it
            alone, nor any emolument that by so doing could accrue either unto him or his people,
            after some small resistance delivered up the island into the hands of its true lord and
            master, under the same articles they had obtained it from the Spaniards. Few days after
            the surrender of the island there arrived from Jamaica an English ship which the
            Governor of the said island had sent underhand, Vherein was a good supply of people,
            both men and women. The Spaniards from the castle, having espied this ship, put forth
            the English colours, and persuaded Le Sieur Simon to go on board and conduct the said
            ship into a port they assigned him. This he performed immediately with dissimulation,
            whereby they were all made prisoners. A certain Spanish engineer has published, before
            me, an exact account and relation of the retaking of the isle of St Catharine by the
            Spaniards ; which printed paper being fallen into my hands, I have thought it fit to be
            inserted here. A true Relation and particular Account of the Victory obtained by the
            Arms of his Catholic Majesty against the English Pirates, by the direction and valour of
            Don John Perez de Guzman, Knight of the Order of St James, Governor and Captain-General
            of Terra Firma and the Province of Veraguas The kingdom of Terra Firma, which of itself
            is sufficiently strong to repulse and extirpate great fleets but more especially the
            Pirates of Jamaica, had several ways notice under several hands imparted to the Governor
            thereof, that fourteen English vessels did cruize upon the coasts belonging to his
            Catholic Majesty. The 14th day of July 1665 news came unto Panama. DON JOHN PEREZ DE
            GUZMAN 123 that the EngHsh Pirates of the said fleet were arrived at Puerto de Naos, and
            had forced the Spanish garrison of the isle of St Catharine, whose Governor was Don
            Kstevan del Campo, and that they had possessed themselves of the said island, taking
            prisoners the inhabitants and destroying all that ever they met. Moreover, about the
            same time Don John Perez de Guzman received particular information of these robberies
            from the relation of some Spaniards who escaped out of the island (and whom he ordered
            to be conveyed unto Porto Bello), who more distinctly told him that the aforementioned
            Pirates came into the Island the 2nd day of May by night, without being perceived by
            anybody ; and that the next day, after some disputes by arms, they had taken the
            fortresses and made prisoners all the inhabitants and soldiers, not one excepted unless
            those that by good fortune had escaped their hands. This being heard by Don John, he
            called a council of war, wherein he declared the great progress the said Pirates had
            made in the dominions of his CathoHc Majesty. Here likewise he propounded : That it was
            absolutely necessary to send some forces unto the isle of St Catharine, sujfficient to
            retake it from the Pirates, the honour and interest of his Majesty of Spain being very
            narrowly concerned herein. Otherwise the Pirates by such conquests might easily in
            course of time possess themselves of all the countries thereabouts. Unto these reasons
            >some Were found who made answer : That the Pirates, as not \heing able to subsist in
            the said island, would of necessity consume and waste themselves, and be forced to quit
            it without any necessity of retaking it. That consequently it was not worth the while to
            engage in so many expenses and troubles as might be foreseen this would cost.
            Notwithstanding these reasons to the con- trary, Don John, as one who was an expert and
            vaUant soldier, gave order that a quantity of provisions should be conveyed to Porto
            Bello, for the use and service of the mihtia. And, neither to be idle nor negligent in
            his master's affairs, he transported himself thither, with no small danger of his Hfe.
            Here he arrived the 7th day of July, with most things necessary to the expedition in
            hand ; where he found in the port a good ship, called St Vincent, that belonged unto the
            Company of the Negroes. This ship being of itself a strong vessel and well mounted with
            guns, he manned and victualled very well, and sent unto the isle of St Catharine,
            constituting Captain Joseph Sanchez Ximenez, Mayor of the city of Porto Bello, Commander
            thereof. The people he carried with him were, 270 soldiers, and 37 prisoners of the same
            island, besides 34 Spaniards belonging to the garrison of Porto 124 THE ISLE OF ST
            CATHARINE Bello, 29 mulattos of Panama, 12 Indians very dexterous at shooting with bows
            and arrows, 7 expert and able gunners, 2 lieutenants, 2 pilots, one surgeon, and one
            religious man of the Order of St Francis for their chaplain. Don John soon after gave
            his orders to every one of the officers, instructing them how they ought to behave
            themselves, teUing them withal that the Governor of Cartagena would assist and supply
            them with more men, boats, and all things else they should find necessary for that
            enterprize ; to which effect he had already written unto the said Governor. On the 24th
            day of the said month Don John commanded the ship to weigh anchor and sail out of the
            port. Then, seeing a fair wind to blow, he called before him all the people designed for
            that expedition, and made them a speech, encouraging them to fight against the enemies
            of their country and religion, but more especially against those inhuman Pirates who had
            heretofore committed so many horrid and cruel actions against the subjects of his
            Catholic Majesty — withal promising to every one of them most liberal rewards, but
            especially unto such as should behave themselves as they ought in the service of their
            king and country. Thus Don John bid them farewell, and immediately the ship weighed
            anchor, and set sail under a favourable gale of wind. The 22nd of the said month they
            arrived at Cartagena, and presented a letter unto the Governor of the said city from the
            noble and valiant Don John, who received it with testimonies of great affection unto the
            person of Don John and his Majesty's service. And, seeing their resolute courage to be
            conformable to his desires and expec- tation, he promised them his assistance, which
            should be with one frigate, one galleon, one boat, and 126 men, the one half out of his
            own garrison, and the other half mulattos. Thus, all of them being well provided with
            necessaries, they set forth from the port of Cartagena the 2nd day of August, and the
            loth of the said month they arrived within sight of the isle of St Catharine, towards
            the Western point thereof. And, although the wind was contrary, yet they reached the
            port, and came to an anchor within it, having lost one of their boats, by foul weather,
            at the rock called Quita Signos. The Pirates, seeing our ships come to an anchor, gave
            them presently three guns with bullets, the which were soon answered in the same coin.
            Hereupon the Mayor Joseph Sanchez Ximenez sent on shore unto the Pirates one of his
            officers, to require them in the name of the Catholic King, his Master, to surrender the
            island, seeing they had taken it in the midst of peace between the two crowns THE ISLE
            OF ST CATHARINE 125 of Spain and England, and tliat, in case they would be obsti- nate,
            he would certainly put them all to the sword. The Pirates made answer ; That island had
            once be/ore belonged unto the Government and dominions of the King of England : and
            that, instead of surrendering it, they preferred to lose their lives. On Friday, the
            13th of the said month, three negroes, from the enemy, came swimming aboard our Admiral.
            These brought intelligence that all the Pirates that were upon the island were only
            threescore-and-twelve in number, and that they were under a great consternation, seeing
            such consider- able forces come against them. With this intelligence the Spaniards
            resolved to land and advance towards the fortresses, the which ceased not to fire as
            many great guns against them as they possibly could, which were corresponded in the same
            manner on our side till dark night. On Sunday, the 15th of the said month, which was the
            day of the Assumption of Our Lady, the weather being very calm and clear, the Spani-
            ards began to advance thus. The ship named St Vincent, which rode Admiral, discharged
            two whole broadsides upon the battery called the Conception. The ship called St Peter,
            that was Vice-Admiral, discharged likewise her guns against the other battery named St
            James. In the meanwhile our people were landed in small boats, directing their course
            towards the point of the battery last mentioned, and thence they marched towards the
            gate called Cortadura. '^The lieutenant Frances de Cazeres, being desirous to view the
            strength of the enemy, with only 15 men, was compelled to retreat in all haste by reason
            of the great guns which played so furiously upon the place where he stood, they shooting
            not only pieces of iron and small bullets, but also the organs of the church,
            discharging in every shot threescore pipes at a time/ Notwithstanding this heat of the
            enemy. Captain Don Joseph Ramirez de Leyva, with threescore men, made a strong attack,
            wherein they fought on both sides very desperately, till that at last he overcame and
            forced the Pirates to surrender the fort he had taken in hand. On the other side.
            Captain John Galeno, with fourscore- and-ten men, passed over the hills, to advance that
            way towards the castle of St Teresa. In the meanwhile the Mayor Don Joseph Sanchez
            Ximenez, as commander-in-chief, with the rest of his men set forth from the battery of
            St James, passing the fort with four boats, and landing in despite of the enemy. About
            this same time Captain John Galeno began to advance with the men he led unto the
            forementioncd fortress. So that our men made three attacks upon the enemy, 126 SURRENDER
            OF THE PIRATES on three several sides, at one and the same time, with great courage and
            valour. Thus the Pirates, seeing many of their men already killed and that they could in
            no manner subsist any longer, retreated towards Cortadura, where they surren- dered
            themselves and likewise the whole island into our hands. Our people possessed themselves
            of all, and set up the Spanish colours, as soon as they had rendered thanks to God
            Almighty for the victory obtained on such a signaHzcd day. The number of dead were six
            men of the enemy's with many wounded, and threescorc-and-ten prisoners. On our side was
            found only one man killed, and four wounded. There was found upon the island 800 pound
            of powder, 250 pound of small bullets, with many other military pro- visions. Among the
            prisoners were taken also two Spaniards who had borne arms under the Enghsh against his
            Catholic Majesty. These were commanded to be shot to death the next day by order of the
            Mayor. The loth day of September arrived at the isle an English vessel, which being seen
            at a great distance by the Mayor, he gave order unto Le Sieur Simon, who was a
            Frenchman, to go and visit the said ship, and tell them that were on board the island
            belonged still unto the English. He performed the commands, and found in the said ship
            only 14 men, one woman and her daughter, who were all instantly made prisoners. The
            Enghsh Pirates were all transported to Porto Bello, excepting only three, who by order
            of the Governor were carried to Panama, there to work in the castle of St Jerome. This
            fortification is an excellent piece of workmanship, and very strong, being raised in the
            middle of the port, of quad- rangular form, and of very hard stone. Its elevation or
            height is 88 geometrical feet, the walls being 14 and the curtains 75 feet diameter. It
            was built at the expense of several private persons, the Governor of the city furnishing
            the greatest part of the money ; so that it did not cost his Majesty any sum at all.
            CHAPTER V Some account of the island of Cuba. Capt. Morgan attempts to preserve the isle
            of St Catharine as a refuge and nest unto Pirates ; but fails of his designs. He arrives
            at and takes the village of El Puerto del Principe /Captain Morgan, seeing his
            predecessor and Admiral Mansvelt was dead, endeavoured as much as he could, and used all
            the means that were possible, to preserve and keep in perpetual possession the Isle of
            St Catharine, seated nigh unto that of Cuba. His principal intent was to consecrate it
            as a refuge and sanctuary unto the Pirates of those parts, putting it in a sufficient
            condition of being a convenient receptacle or storehouse of their preys and robberies.
            Unto this effect he left no stone unmoved whereby to compass his designs, writing for
            the same purpose unto several merchants that lived in Virginia and New England, and
            persuading them to send him provisions and other necessary things towards the putting
            the said island in such a posture of defence as it might neither fear any external
            dangers nor be moved at any suspicions of invasion from any side that might attempt to
            disquiet it. At last all his thoughts and cares proved ineffectual by the Spaniards
            retaking the said island. Yet, notwithstanding. Captain Morgan retained his ancient
            courage, which instantly put him upon new designs. Thus he equipped at first a ship,
            with intention to gather an entire fleet, both as great and as strong as he could
            compass. By degrees he put the whole matter in execution, and gave order unto every
            member of this fleet, they should meet at a certain port of Cuba. Here he determined to
            call a council, and deliberate concerning what were best to be done, and what place
            first hey should fall upon. Leaving these new preparations in this condition, I shall
            here give my reader some small account 127 128 THE ISLAND OF CUBA of the aforementioned
            isle of Cuba, in whose ports this expe- dition was hatched, seeing I omitted to do it in
            its proper place. The island of Cuba lies from East to West, in the latitude and
            situation of twenty unto 23 degrees North, being in length 150 German leagues and about
            40 in breadth. Its fertihty is equal unto that of the island of Hispaniola. Besides
            which, it affords many things proper for trading and commerce, such as are hides of
            several beasts, particularly those that in Europe are called Hides of Havana. On all
            sides it is surrounded with a great number of small islands, which go altogether under
            the name of Cayos. Of these little islands the Pirates make great use, as of their own
            proper ports of refuge. Here most com- monly they make their meetings and hold their
            councils, how to assault more easily the Spaniards. It is thoroughly irrigated on all
            sides with the streams of plentiful and pleasant rivers, whose entries do form both
            secure and spacious ports, besides many other harbours for ships, which along the calm
            shores and coasts do adorn many parts of this rich and beautiful island ; all which
            contribute very much unto its happiness, by facilitating the exercise of trade,
            whereunto they invite both natives and aliens. The chiefest of these ports are Santiago,
            Bayame, Santa Maria, Espiritu Santo, Trinidad, Xagoa, Cabo de Corrientes, and others,
            all which are seated on the south side of the island. On the northern side hereof are
            found the following : La Havana, Puerto Mariano, Santa Cruz, Mata Ricos, and Barracoa.
            This island has two principal cities, by which the whole country is governed, and unto
            which all the towns and villages thereof do give obedience. The first of these is named
            Santiago, or St James, being seated on the South side, and having under its jurisdiction
            one half of the island. The chief magistrates hereof are a Bishop and a Governor, who
            command over the villages and towns belonging to the half above-mentioned. The chiefest
            of these are, on the Southern side Espiritu Santo, Puerto del Principe, and Bayame ; on
            the North side it has Barracoa and the town called De los Cayos. The greatest part of
            the commerce driven at the aforementioned city of Santiago comes from the Canary
            Islands, whither they transport great quantity of tobacco, sugar, and hides : which
            sorts of merchandize are drawn to the head city from CAPT. MORGAN EQUIPS A FLEET 129 the
            subordinate towns and villages. In former times this city of Santiago was miserably
            sacked by the Pirates of Jamaica and Tortuga, notwithstanding that it is defended by a
            con- siderable castle. The city and port De la Havana lies between the North and West
            side of the island. This is one of the renownedest and strongest places of all the West
            Indies. Its jurisdiction extends over the other half of the island, the chiefest places
            under it being Santa Cruz on the Northern side and La Trinidad on the South. Hence is
            transported huge quantities of tobacco, which is sent in great plenty unto New Spain and
            Costa Rica, even as far as the South Sea ; besides many ships laden with this commodity
            that are consigned to Spain and other parts of Europe, not only in the leaf but also in
            rolls. This city is defended by three castles, very great and strong, two of which lie
            towards the port, and the other is seated upon a hill that commands the town. Tis
            esteemed to contain 10,000 families, more or less ; among which number of people the
            merchants of this place trade in New Spain, Campeche, Honduras, and Florida. All the
            ships that come from the parts aforementioned, as also from Caracas, Cartagena, and
            Costa Rica, are necessitated to take their provisions in at Havana, wherewith to make
            their voyage for Spain ; this being the necessary and straight course they ought to
            steer for the South of Europe and other parts. The plate-fleet of Spain, which the
            Spaniards call flota, being homeward bound, touches here yearly, to take in the rest of
            their full cargo, as hides, tobacco, and Campeche wood. Captain Morgan had been no
            longer than two months in the above-mentioned ports of the South of Cuba, when he had
            got together a fleet of twelve sail, between ships and great boats ; wherein he had 700
            fighting men, part of which were English and part French. They called a council, and
            some were of opinion 'twere convenient to assault the city of Havana under the obscurity
            of the night ; which enterprize, they said, might easily be performed, especially if
            they could but take any few of the ecclesiastics and make them prisoners — yea, that the
            city might be sacked, before the castles could put themselves in a posture of defence.
            Others propounded, according to their several opinions, other attempts. Not-
            withstanding, the former proposal was rejected, because many I30 ATTACK ON PUERTO DEL
            PRINCIPE of the Pirates had been prisoners at other times in the said city ; and these
            affirmed nothing of consequence could be done unless with 1500 men. Moreover, that with
            all this number of people they ought first to go unto the island De los Pinos, and land
            them in small boats about Matamana, 14 leagues distant from the aforesaid city, whereby
            to accomphsh by these means and order their designs. Finally, they saw no possibility of
            gathering so great a fleet ; and hereupon with that they had they concluded to attempt
            some other place. Among the rest was found, at last, one who propounded they should go
            and assault the town of El Puerto del Principe. This proposition he endeavoured to
            persuade, by saying he knew that place very well, and that, being at a distance from the
            sea, it never was sacked by any Pirates, whereby the inhabitants were rich, as
            exercising their trade for ready money with those of Havana, who kept here an estab-
            lished commerce which consisted chiefly in hides. This proposal was presently admitted
            by Captain Morgan and the chiefest of his companions. And hereupon they gave order to
            every Captain to weigh anchor and set sail, steering their course towards that coast
            that lies nearest unto El Puerto del Principe. Hereabouts is to be seen a bay named by
            the Spaniards El Puerto de Santa Maria. Being arrived at this bay, a certain Spaniard,
            who was prisoner on board the fleet, swam ashore by night, and came unto the town of
            Puerto del Principe, giving account to the inhabitants of the design the Pirates had
            against them. This he affirmed to have over- heard in their discourse, while they
            thought he did not under- stand the English tongue. The Spaniards, as soon as they
            received this fortunate advice, began instantly to hide their riches, and carry away
            what movables they could. The Governor also immediately raised all the people of the
            town, both freeman and slaves ; and with part of them took a post by which of necessity
            the Pirates were to pass. He commanded likewise many trees to be cut down and laid
            amidst the ways to hinder their passage. In like manner he placed several ambuscades,
            which were strengthened with some pieces of cannon, to play upon them on their march. He
            gathered in all about 800 men, of which he distributed several into the aforementioned
            ambuscades, and with the rest he begirt the town, displaying them upon the plain of a
            spacious PUERTO DEL PRINCIPE SURRENDERS 131 field, whence they could see the coming of
            the Pirates at length. Captain Morgan, with his men, being now upon the march, found the
            avenues and passages unto the town impenetrable. Hereupon they took the way through the
            wood, traversing it with great difficulty, whereby they escaped divers ambuscades. Thus
            at last they came into the plain aforementioned, which, from its figure, is called by
            the Spaniards La Savana, or The Sheet. The Governor, seeing them come, made a detach-
            ment of a troop of horse, which he sent to charge them in the front, thinking to
            disperse them, and, by putting them to flight, pursue them with his main body. But this
            design succeeded not as it was intended. For the Pirates marched in very good rank and
            file, at the sound of their drums and with flying colours. When they came nigh unto the
            horse, they drew into the form of a semicircle, and thus advanced towards the Spaniards,
            who charged them like valiant and courageous soldiers for some while. But, seeing that
            the Pirates were very dexterous at their arms, and their Governor with many of their
            companions killed, they began to retreat towards the wood. Here they designed to save
            themselves with more advantage ; but, before they could reach it, the greatest part of
            them were unfortunately killed by the hands of the Pirates. Thus they left the victory
            unto these new- come enemies, who had no considerable loss of men in this battle, and
            but very few wounded, howbeit the skirmish continued for the space of four hours. They
            entered the town, though not without great resistance of such as were within, who
            defended themselves as long as was possible, think- ing by their defence to hinder the
            pillage. Hereupon many, seeing the enemy within the town, shut themselves up in their
            own houses, and thence made several shot against the Pirates, who perceiving the
            mischief of this disadvantage, presently began to threaten them saying : // you
            surrender not voluntarily, you shall soon see the town in a flame, and your wives and
            children torn in pieces before your faces. With these menaces the Spaniards submitted
            entirely to the discretion of the Pirates, believing they could not continue there long
            and would soon be forced to dislodge. As soon as the Pirates had possessed themselves of
            the town, they enclosed all the Spaniards, both men, women, and children. 132 PUT TO
            RANSOM and slaves, in several churches ; and gathered all the goods they could find by
            way of pillage. Afterwards they searched the whole country round about the town,
            bringing [in] day by day many goods and prisoners, with much provision. With this they
            fell to banqueting among themselves and making great cheer after their customary way,
            without remembering the poor prisoners, whom they permitted to starve in the churches
            for hunger. In the meanwhile they ceased not to torment them daily after an inhuman
            manner, thereby to make them confess where they hid their goods, moneys, and other
            things, though little or nothing was left them. Unto this effect they punished also the
            women and little children, giving them nothing to eat ; whereby the greatest part
            perished. When they could find no more to rob, and that provisions began to grow scarce,
            they thought it convenient to depart and seek new fortunes in other places. Hence they
            intimated to the prisoners : They should find moneys to ransom themselves, else they
            should be all transported to Jamaica. Which being done, if they did not pay a second
            ransom for the town, they would turn every house into ashes. The Spaniards, hearing
            these severe menaces, nominated among themselves four fellow- prisoners to go and seek
            for the above-mentioned contribu- tions. But the Pirates, to the intent they should
            return speedily with the ransoms prescribed, tormented several in their presence, before
            they departed, with all the rigour imaginable. After few days, the Spaniards returned
            from the fatigue of their unreasonable commissions, teUing Captain Morgan : We have run
            up and down, and searched all the neighbouring woods and places we most suspected, and
            yet have not been able to find any of our own party, nor consequently any fruit of our
            embassy. But if you are pleased to have a little longer patience with us, we shall
            certainly cause all that you demand to be paid within the space of fifteen days. Captain
            Morgan was contented, as it should seem, to grant them this petition. But, not long
            after, there came into the town seven or eight Pirates, who had been ranging the woods
            and fields, and got thereabouts some considerable booty. These brought among other
            prisoners a certain negro, whom they had taken with letters about him. Captain Morgan
            having perused them, found they were from the Governor of Santiago, being written FRENCH
            AND ENGLISH DISCORD 133 to some of the prisoners ; wherein he told them : They should
            not make loo -much hasle to pay any ransom for their town or persons or any other
            pretext. But, on the contrary, they should put off the Pirates as well as they could
            with excuses and delays, expect- ing to he relieved by him within a short while, when he
            would certainly come to their aid. This intelligence being heard by Captain Morgan, he
            immediately gave orders that all they had robbed should be carried on board the ships.
            And, withal, he intimated to the Spaniards that the very next day they should pay their
            ransoms forasmuch as he would not wait one moment longer but reduce the whole town to
            ashes in case they failed to perform the sum demanded. With this intimation Captain
            Morgan made no mention unto the Spaniards of the letters he had intercepted. Whereupon
            they made him answer that it was totally impossible for them to give such a sum of money
            in so short a space of time, seeing their fellow-townsmen were not to be found in all
            the country thereabouts. Captain Morgan knew full well their intentions, and, withal,
            thought it not convenient to remain there any longer time. Hence he demanded of them
            only 500 oxen or cows, together with sufficient salt wherewith to salt them. Hereunto he
            added only this condition, that they should carry them on board his ships, which they
            promised to do. Thus he departed with all his men, taking with him only six of the
            principal prisoners, as pledges of what he intended. The next day the Spaniards brought
            the cattle and salt to the ships, and required the prisoners. But Captain Morgan refused
            to deliver them till such time as they helped his men to kill and salt the beeves. This
            was likewise performed in great haste, he not caring to stay there any longer, lest he
            should be surprised by the forces that were gathering against him. Having received all
            on board his vessels, he set at liberty the prisoners he had kept as hostages of his
            demands. ^ While these things were in agitation, there happened to arise some
            dissensions between the Englishmen and the French. The occasion of their discord was as
            follows : A certain Frenchman being employed in killing and salting one of the beeves,
            an English Pirate came to him and took away the marrow-bones he had taken out of the ox
            ; which sort of meat these people esteem very much. Hereupon they challenged one
            another. Being come unto the place of duel, the Englishmari drew his sword treacherously
            against 134 RETURN TO JAMAICA the Frenchman, wounding him in the back, before he had put
            himself into a just posture of defence ; whereby he suddenly fell dead upon the place.
            The other Frenchmen, desirous to revenge this base action, made an insurrection against
            the English. But Captain Morgan soon extinguished this flame, by commanding the criminal
            to be bound in chains, and thus carried to Jamaica, promising to them all he would see
            justice done upon him. For, although it were permitted unto him to challenge his
            adversary, yet it was not lawful to kill him treacherously, as he did. As soon as all
            things were in readiness and on board the ships, and likewise the prisoners set at
            liberty, they sailed thence, directing their course to a certain island, where Captain
            Morgan intended to make a dividend of what they had pur- chased in that voyage. Being
            arrived at the place assigned, they found nigh the value of 50,000 pieces-of-eight, both
            in money and goods. The sum being known, it caused a general resentment and grief, to
            see such a small purchase, which was not sufficient to pay their debts at Jamaica.
            Hereupon Captain Morgan propounded to them they should think upon some other enterprize
            and pillage before they returned home. But the Frenchmen, not being able to agree with
            the English, separated from their company, leaving Captain Morgan alone with those of
            his own nation, notwithstanding all the persuasions he used to induce them to continue
            in his company. Thus they parted with all external signs of friendship. Captain Morgan
            reiterating his promises unto them that he would see justice done upon that criminal.
            This he performed ; for, being arrived at Jamaica, he caused him to be hanged, which was
            all the satisfaction the French Pirates could expect. CHAPTER VI I Captain Morgan
            resolves to attack and plunder the city of Porto Bello. Unto this effect he equips a
            fleet, and with Utile expense and small forces takes the said place Some nations may
            think that, the French having deserted Captain Morgan, the English alone could not have
            sufficient courage to attempt such great actions as before. But Captain Morgan, who
            always communicated vigour with his words, infused such spirits into his men as were
            able to put every one of them instantly upon new designs, they being all persuaded by
            his reasons that the sole execution of his orders would be a certain means of obtaining
            great riches. This persuasion had such influence upon their minds that with inimitable
            courage they all resolved to follow him. The same likewise did a certain Pirate of
            Campeche, who in this occasion joined with Captain Morgan to seek new fortunes under his
            conduct, and greater advantages than he had found before. Thus Captain Morgan in a few
            days gathered a fleet of nine sail, between ships and great boats, wherein he had
            four-hundred-and- threescore military men. After that all things were in good posture of
            readiness, they put forth to sea. Captain Morgan imparting the design he had in his mind
            unto nobody for that present. He only told them on several occasions that he held as
            indubitable he should make a good fortune by that voyage, if strange occur- rences
            altered not the course of his designs. They directed their course towards the continent,
            where they arrived in few days upon the coast of Costa Rica, with all their fleet
            entire. No sooner had they discovered land than Captain Morgan declared his intentions
            to the Captains, and presently after unto all the rest of the company. He told them he
            intended in that expedition to plunder Porto Bello^'and that he would 135 / 136
            EXPEDITION TO PORTO BELLO perform it by night, being resolved to put the whole city to
            the sack, not the least corner escaping his diligence. More- over, to encourage them, he
            added : This enterprize could not fail to succeed well, seeing he had kept it secret in
            his mind without revealing it to anybody ; whereby they could not have notice of his
            coming. Unto this proposition some made answer : They had not a sufficient number of men
            wherewith to assault so strong and great a city. But Captain Morgan replied : // our
            number is small, our hearts are great. And the fewer persons we are, the more union and
            better shares we shall have in the spoil. Hereupon, being stimulated with the ambition
            of those vast riches they promised themselves from their good success, they unanimously
            concluded to venture upon that design. But now, to the intent my reader may better
            comprehend the incomparable boldness of this exploit, it may be necessary to say
            something beforehand of the city of Porto Bello. The city which bears this name in
            America is seated in the Province of Costa Rica, under the latitude of lo degrees North,
            at the distance of 14 leagues from the Gulf of Darien, and 8 Westwards from the port
            called Nombre de Dios. It is judged to be the strongest place that the King of Spain
            possesses in all the West Indies, excepting two, that is to say Havana and Cartagena.
            Here are two castles, almost in- expugnable, that defend the city, being situated at the
            entry of the port, so that no ship or boat can pass without permission. The garrison
            consists of three hundred soldiers, and the town constantly inhabited by four hundred
            families, more or less. The merchants dwell not here, but only reside for awhile, when
            the galleons come or go from Spain, by reason of the unhealthiness of the air,
            occasioned by certain vapours that exhale from the mountains. Notwithstanding, their
            chief warehouses are at Porto Bello, howbeit their habitations are all the year long at
            Panama, whence they bring the plate upon mules at such times as the fair begins, and
            when the ships belonging to the Company of Negroes arrive here to sell slaves. Captain
            Morgan, who knew very well all the avenues of this city, as also all the neighbouring
            coasts, arrived in the dusk of the evening at the place called Puerto de Naos, distant
            ten leagues towards the West of Porto Bello. Being come unto this place, they mounted
            the river in their ships, as far as another harbour called Puerto Pontin, where they
            came to an EXPEDITION TO PORTO BELLO 137 anchor. Here they put themselves immediately
            into boats and canoes, leaving in the ships only a few men to keep them and conduct them
            the next day unto the port. About mid- night they came to a certain place called Estera
            Longa Lemos, where they all went on shore, and marched by land to the first posts of the
            city. They had in their company a certain Englishman who had been formerly a prisoner in
            those parts and who now served them for a guide. Unto him, and three or four more, they
            gave commission to take the sentry, if possible, or kill him upon the place. But they
            laid hands on him and apprehended him with such cunning that he had no time to give
            warning with his musket or make any other noise. Thus they brought him, with his hands
            bound, unto Captain Morgan, who asked him : How things went in the city, and what forces
            they had ; with many other circumstances, which he was desirous to know. After every
            question, they made him a thousand menaces to kill him, in case he declared not the
            truth. Thus they began to advance towards the city, carrying always the said sentry
            bound before them. Having marched about one quarter of a league, they came unto the
            castle that is nigh unto the city, which presently they closely surrounded, so that no
            person could get either in or out of the said fortress. Being thus posted under the
            walls of the castle. Captain Morgan commanded the sentry whom they had taken prisoner to
            speak unto those that were within, charging them to sur- render and deliver themselves
            up to his discretion — otherwise they should be all cut to pieces, without giving
            quarter to any one. But they would hearken to none of these threats, beginning instantly
            to fire ; which gave notice unto the city, and this was suddenly alarmed. Yet,
            notwithstanding, although the Governor and soldiers of the said castle made as great
            resist- ance as could be performed, they were constrained to surrender unto the Pirates.
            These no sooner had taken the castle but they resolved to be as good as their words, in
            putting the Spaniards to the sword, thereby to strike a terror into the rest of the
            city. Hereupon, having shut up all the soldiers and officers as prisoners into one room,
            they instantly set fire to the powder (whereof they found great quantity), and blew up
            the whole castle into the air, with all the Spaniards that were within. This being done,
            they pursued the course of their victory, falling upon the city, which as yet was not in
            order 138 ASSAULT OF THE CASTLE to receive them. Many of the inhabitants cast their
            precious jewels and moneys into wells and cisterns, or hid them in other places
            underground, to excuse, as much as were possible, their being totally robbed. One party
            of the Pirates, being assigned to this purpose, ran immediately to the cloisters, and
            took as many religious men and women as they could find. The Governor of the city not
            being able to rally the citizens through the huge confusion of the town, retired unto
            one of the castles remaining, and thence began to fire incessantly at the Pirates. But
            these were not in the least negligent either to assault him or defend themselves with
            all the courage imaginable. Thus it was observable that, amidst the horror of the
            assault, they made very few shot in vain. For, aiming with great dexterity at the mouths
            of the guns, the Spaniards were certain to lose one or two men every time they charged
            each gun anew. The assault of this castle where the Governor was continued very furious
            on both sides, from break of day until noon. Yea, about this time of the day the case
            was very dubious which party should conquer or be conquered. At last the Pirates,
            perceiving they had lost many men and as yet advanced but little towards the gaining
            either this or the other castles remaining, thought to make use of fireballs, which they
            threw with their hands, designing if possible to burn the doors of the castle. But,
            going about to put this into execution, the Spaniards from the wall let fall great
            quantities of stones and earthen pots full of powder and other combustible matter, which
            forced them to desist from that attempt. Captain Morgan, seeing this generous defence
            made by the Spaniards, began to despair of the -vvhole success of the enterprize.
            Hereupon many faint and calm meditations came into his mind ; neither could he determine
            which way to turn himself in that straitness of affairs. Being involved in these
            thoughts, he was suddenly animated to continue the assault by seeing the English colours
            put forth at one of the lesser castles, then entered by his men, of whom he presently
            after spied a troop that came to meet him, proclaiming victory with loud shouts of joy.
            This instantly put him upon new resolutions of making new efforts to take the rest of
            the castles that stood out against him, especially seeing the chiefest citizens were
            fled unto them and had conveyed thither great CAPTURE OF PORTO BELLO 139 part of their
            riches, with all the plate belonging to the churches and other things dedicated to
            divine service. Unto this effect, therefore, he ordered ten or twelve ladders to be
            made, in all possible haste, so broad that three or four men at once might ascend by
            them. These being finished, he commanded all the religious men and women whom he had
            taken prisoners to fix them against the walls of the castle. Thus much he had beforehand
            threatened the Governor to perform, in case he delivered not the castle. But his answer
            was : He would never surrender himself alive. Captain Morgan was much persuaded that the
            Governor would not employ his utmost forces, seeing religious women and ecclesiastical
            persons exposed in the front of the soldiers to the greatest dangers. Thus the ladders,
            as I have said, were put into the hands of religious persons of both sexes ; and these
            were forced, at the head of the companies, to raise and apply them to the walls. But
            Captain Morgan was fully deceived in his judgment of this design. For the Governor who
            acted like a brave and courageous soldier, refused not, in performance of his duty, to
            use his utmost endeavours to destroy whosoever came near the walls. The religious men
            and women ceased not to cry unto him and beg of him by all the Saints of Heaven he would
            deliver the castle, and hereby spare both his and their own lives. But nothing could
            prevail with the obstinacy and fierceness that had possessed the Governor's mind. Thus
            many of the religious men and nuns were killed before they could fix the ladders — which
            at last being done, though with great loss of the said rehgious people, the Pirates
            mounted them in great numbers, and with no less valour, having fireballs in their hands,
            and earthen pots full of powder — all which things, being now at the top of the walls,
            they kindled and cast in among the Spaniards. This effort of the Pirates was very
            great,- insomuch as the Spaniards could no longer resist nor defend the castle, which
            was now entered. Hereupon they all threw down their arms, and craved quarter for their
            lives. Only the Governor of the city would admit or crave no mercy, but rather killed
            many of the Pirates with his own hands, and not a few of his own soldiers, because they
            did not stand to their arms. And, although the Pirates asked him if he would have
            quarter, yet he constantly answered : By no means : I had rather die as 140 THE PIRATES
            IN PORTO BELLO a valiant soldier than he hanged as a coward. They endeavoured, as much
            as they could, to take him prisoner. But he defended himself so obstinately that they
            were forced to kill him, notwithstanding all the cries and tears of his own wife and
            daughter, who begged of him upon their knees he would demand quarter and save his life.
            When the Pirates had possessed themselves of the castle, which was about night, they
            enclosed therein all the prisoners they had taken, placing the women and men by
            themselves with some guards upon them. All the wounded were put into a certain apartment
            by itself, to the intent their own complaints might be the cure of their diseases, for
            no other was afforded them. This being done, they fell to eating and drinking after
            their usual manner — that is to say, committing in both these things all manner of
            debauchery and excess. These two vices were immediately followed by many insolent
            actions of rape and adultery committed upon very honest women, as well married as
            virgins, who being threatened with the sword were constrained to submit their bodies to
            the violence of these lewd and wicked men. After such manner they delivered themselves
            up to all sort of debauchery of this kind, that if there had been found only fifty
            courageous men, they might easily have retaken the city, and killed all the Pirates. The
            next day, having plundered all they could find, they began to examine some of the
            prisoners (who had been persuaded by their companions to say they were the richest of
            the town), charging them severely to discover where they had hidden their riches and
            goods. But, not being able to extort anything out of them, as they were not the right
            persons who possessed any wealth, they at last resolved to torture them. This they
            performed with such cruelty that many of them died upon the rack, or pres- ently after.
            Sooij after, the President of Panama had news brought him of the pillage and ruin of
            Porto Bello. This intelligence caused him to employ all his care and industry to raise
            forces, with design to pursue and cast out the Pirates thence. But these cared little
            for what extraordinary means the President used, as having their ships nigh at hand and
            being determined to set fire unto the city and retreat. They had now been at Porto Bello
            fifteen days, in which space of time they had lost many of their men, both by the
            unhealthiness CAPT. MORGAN AT PORTO BELLO 141 of the country and the extravagant
            debaucheries they had committed. Hereupon they prepared for a departure, carrying on
            board their ships all the pillage they had gotten. But, before all, they provided the
            fleet with sufficient victuals for the voyage. While these things were getting ready.
            Captain Morgan sent an injunction unto the prisoners, that they should pay him a ransom
            for the city, or else he would by fire consume it to ashes and blow up all the castles
            into the air. Withal he commanded them to send speedily two persons to seek and procure
            the sum he demanded, which amounted to 100,000 pieces-of-eight. Unto this effect two men
            were sent to the President of Panama, who gave him an account of all these tragedies.
            The President, having now a body of men in a readiness, set forth immediately towards
            Porto Bello, to encounter the Pirates before their retreat. But these people, hearing of
            his coming, instead of flying away went out to meet him at a narrow passage through
            which of necessity he ought to pass. Here they placed an hundred men very well armed,
            the which at the first encounter put to flight a good party of those of Panama. This
            accident obliged the President to retire for that time, as not being yet in a posture of
            strength to proceed any farther. Presently after this encounter, he sent a message unto
            Captain Morgan, to tell him : That, in case he departed not suddenly with all his forces
            from Porto Bello, he ought to expect no quarter for himself nor his companions, when he
            should take them, as he hoped soon to do. Captain Morgan, who feared not his threats, as
            knowing he had a secure retreat in his ships which were nigh at hand, made him answer :
            He wouldnot deliver the castles before he had received the contribution- money he had
            demanded. Which in case it were not paid down, he would certainly burn the whole city,
            and then leave it, demolish- ing beforehand the castles and killing the prisoners. The
            Governor of Panama perceived by this answer no means would serve to moUify the hearts of
            the Pirates, nor reduce them to reason. Hereupon he determined to leave them, as also
            those of the city, whom he came to reHeve, involved in the difficulties of making the
            best agreement they could with their enemies. Thus in few days more the miserable
            citizens gathered the contribution wherein they were fined, and brought the entire sum
            of ,100,000 pieces-of-eight unto the Pirates for 142 DEPARTURE FOR CUBA a ransom of the
            cruel captivity they were fallen into. But the President of Panama, by these
            transactions, was brought into an extreme admiration, considering that four-hundred men
            had been able to take such a great city with so many strong castles, especially seeing
            they had no pieces of cannon nor other great guns wherewith to raise batteries against
            them. And, what was more, knowing that the citizens of Porto Bello had always great
            repute of being good soldiers themselves, and who had never wanted courage in their own
            defence. This astonishment was so great that it occasioned him, for to be satisfied
            herein, to send a messenger unto Captain Morgan, desiring him to send him some small
            pattern of those arms wherewith he had taken with such violence so great a city. Captain
            Morgan received this messenger very kindly, and treated him with great civility. Which
            being done, he gave him a pistol and a few small bullets of lead, to carry back unto the
            President, his master, telling him withal : He desired him to accept that slender
            pattern of the arms wherewith he had taken Porto Bello, and keep them for a twelvemonth
            ; after which time he promised to come to Panama and fetch them away. The Governor of
            Panama returned the present very soon to Captain Morgan, giving him thanks for the
            favour of lending him such weapons as he needed not, and withal sent him a ring of gold,
            with this message : That he desired him not to give him- self the labour of coming to
            Panama, as he had done to Porto Bello, for he did certify to him, he should not speed so
            well here as he had done there. After these transactions. Captain Morgan (having
            provided his fleet with all necessaries, and taken with him the best guns of the
            castles, nailing the rest which he could not carry away) set sail from Porto Bello with
            all his ships. With these he arrived in few days unto the island of Cuba, where he
            sought out a place wherein with all quiet and repose he might make the dividend of the
            spoil they had gotten. They found in ready money 250,000 pieces-of-eight, besides all
            other merchandizes, as cloth, linen, silks, and other goods. With this rich purchase
            they sailed again thence unto their common place of ren- dezvous, Jamaica. Being
            arrived, they passed here some time in all sorts of vices and debauchery, according to
            their common manner of doing, spending with huge prodigahty what others had gained with
            no small labour and toil. CHAPTER VII Captain Morgan takes the city of Maracaibo, on the
            coast of New Venezuela. Piracies committed in those seas. Ruin of three Spanish ships
            that were set forth to hinder the robberies of the Pirates Not long after the arrival of
            the Pirates at Jamaica, being precisely that short time they needed to lavish away all
            the riches above-mentioned, they concluded upon another enter- prize whereby to seek new
            fortunes. Unto this effect Captain Morgan gave orders to all the Commanders of his ships
            to meet together at the island called De la Vaca, or Cow Isle, seated on the South side
            of the isle of Hispaniola, as has been men- tioned above. As soon as they came to this
            place, there flocked unto them great numbers of other Pirates, both French and English,
            by reason the name of Captain Morgan was now rendered famous in all the neighbouring
            countries for the great enterprizes he had performed. There was at that present at
            Jamaica an English ship newly come from New England, well mounted with thirty-six guns.
            This vessel likewise, by order of the Governor of Jamaica, came to join with Captain
            Morgan to strengthen his fleet and give him greater courage to attempt things of huge
            consequence. With this supply Captain Morgan judged himself sufficiently strong, as
            having a ship of such port being the greatest of his fleet, in his com- pany.
            Notwithstanding, there being in the same place another great vessel that carried 24 iron
            guns and twelve of brass, belonging to the French, Captain Morgan endeavoured as much as
            he could to join this ship in like manner unto his own. But the French, not daring to
            repose any trust in the English, of whose actions were not a little jealous, denied
            absolutely to consent unto any such thing. / The French Pirates belonging to this great
            ship had accident- ally met at sea an English vessel ; and, being then under an M3 144
            CAPTAIN MORGAN'S TREACHERY extreme necessity of victuals, they had taken some provisions
            out of the Enghsh ship without paying for them, as having peradventure no ready money on
            board. Only they had given them bills-of-exchange, for Jamaica and Tortuga, to receive
            money there for what they had taken. Captain Morgan, having notice of this accident and
            perceiving he could not prevail with the French Captain to follow him in that
            expedition, resolved to lay hold on this occasion as a pretext to ruin the French and
            seek his own revenge. Hereupon he invited, with dissimulation, the French commander and
            several of his men to dine with him on board the great ship that was come from Jamaica,
            as was said before. Being come thither, he made them all prisoners, pretending the
            injury aforementioned done to the Enghsh vessel in taking away some few provisions
            without pay. This unjust action of Captain Morgan was soon followed by divine
            punishment, as we may very rationally conceive. The manner I shall instantly relate.
            Captain Morgan, presently after he had taken the French prisoners abovesaid, called a
            council to deliberate what place they should first pitch upon, in the course of this new
            expedition. At this council it was determined to go to the isle of Savona, there to wait
            for the fioia which was then expected from Spain, and take any of the Spanish vessels
            that might chance to straggle from the rest. This resolution being taken, they began on
            board the great ship to feast one another for joy of their new voyage and happy council,
            as they hoped it would prove. In testimony hereof, they drank many healths, and
            discharged many guns, as the common sign of mirth among seamen used to be. Most of the
            men being drunk, by what accident is not known the ship suddenly was blown up into the
            air, with 350 Enghshmen, besides the French prisoners above-mentioned that were in the
            hold. Of all which number there escaped only thirty men, who were in the great cabin at
            some distance from the main force of the powder. Many more 'tis thought might have
            escaped, had they not been so much overtaken with wine. The loss of such a great ship
            brought much consternation and conflict of mind upon the Enghsh. They knew not whom to
            blame ; but at last the accusation was laid upon the French prisoners, whom they
            suspected to have fired the powder of the ship wherein they were, out of design to
            revenge A GREAT SHIP BLOWN UP 145 themselves, though with the loss of their own lives.
            Hereupon they sought to be revenged on the French anew, and accumu- late new accusations
            unto the former, whereby to seize the ship and all that was in it. With this design they
            forged another pretext against the said ship, by saying the French designed to commit
            piracy upon the English. The grounds of this accusation were given them by a commission
            from the Governor of Barracoa, found on board the French vessel, wherein were these
            words : That the said Governor did permit the French to trade in all Spanish ports, etc.
            . . . as also to cruize upon the English Pirates in what place soever they could find
            them, because of the multitude of hostilities which they had committed against the
            subjects of his Catholic Majesty in time of peace betwixt the two Crowns. This
            Commission for trade was interpreted by the English as an express order to exercise
            piracy and war against them, notwithstanding it was only a bare licence for coming into
            the Spanish ports ; the cloak of which permission were those words inserted : That they
            should cruize upon the Efiglish. And, although the French did sufficiently expound the
            true sense of the said Commission, yet they could not clear themselves unto Captain
            Morgan nor his council. But, in lieu hereof, the ship and men were seized and sent unto
            Jamaica. Here they also en- deavoured to obtain justice and the restitution of their
            ship, by all the means possible. But all was in vain ; for, instead of justice, they
            were long time detained in prison and threatened with hanging. Eight days after the loss
            of the said ship. Captain Morgan commanded the bodies of the miserable wretches who were
            blown up to be searched for, as they floated upon the waters of the sea. This he did,
            not out of any design of affording them Christian burial, but only to obtain the spoil
            of their clothes and other attire. And, if any had golden rings on their fingers, these
            were cut off for purchase, leaving them in that condition exposed to the voracity of the
            monsters of the sea. At last they set sail for the isle of Savona, being the place of
            their assignation. They were in all 15 vessels. Captain Morgan commanding the biggest,
            which carried only 14 small guns. The number of men belonging to this fleet were
            nine-hundred- and-threescore. In few days after, they arrived at the Cape called Cabo de
            Lobos. on the South side of the isle of His- 146 STRATAGEM OF THE SPANIARDS paniola,
            between Cape Tiburon and Cape Punta d'Espada. Hence they could not pass, by reason of
            contrary winds that continued the space of three weeks, notwithstanding all the
            endeavours Captain Morgan used to get forth, leaving no means unattempted thereunto. At
            the end of this time they doubled the cape, and presently after spied an English vessel
            at a distance. Having spoken with her, they found she came from England, and bought of
            her for ready money some provisions they stood in need of. Captain Morgan proceeded in
            the course of his voyage, till he came unto the port of Ocoa. Here he landed some of his
            men, sending them into the woods to seek water and what provisions they could find, the
            better to spare such as he had already on board his fleet. They killed many beasts, and
            among other animals some horses. But the Spaniards, being not well satisfied at their
            hunting, attempted to lay a strata- gem for the Pirates. Unto this purpose they ordered
            three or four hundred men to come from the city of San Domingo, not far distant from
            this port, and desired them to hunt in all the parts thereabouts adjoining the sea, to
            the intent that, if any Pirates should return, they might find no subsistence. Within a
            few days the same Pirates returned, with design to hunt. But, finding nothing to kill, a
            party of them, being about fifty in number, straggled farther on into the woods. The
            Spaniards, who watched all their motions, gathered a great herd of cows, and set two or
            three men to keep them. The Pirates having spied this herd, killed a sufficient number
            there- of ; and, although the Spaniards could see them at a distance, yet they would not
            hinder their work for the present. But, as soon as they attempted to carry them away,
            they set upon them with all fury imaginable, crying : Mata, mata ! that is, Kill, kill !
            Thus the Pirates were soon compelled to quit the prey, and retreat towards their ships
            as well as they could. This they performed, notwithstanding, in good order, retiring
            from time to time by degrees ; and, when they had any good opportunity, discharging full
            volleys of shot upon the Spaniards. By this means the Pirates killed many of the
            enemies, though with some loss on their own side. The rest of the Spaniards, seeing what
            damage they had sustained, endeavoured to save themselves by flight, and carry off the
            dead bodies and wounded of their companions. ARRIVAL AT SAVONA 147 The Pirates,
            perceiving them to flee, could not content them- selves with what hurt they had already
            done, but pursued them speedily into the woods, and killed the greatest part of those
            that were remaining. The next day Captain Morgan, being extremely offended at what had
            passed, went himself with 200 men into the woods, to seek for the rest of the Spaniards.
            But, finding nobody there, he revenged his wrath upon the houses of the poor and
            miserable rustics that inhabit scatteringly those fields and woods : of which he burnt a
            great number. With this he returned unto his ships, something more satisfied in his
            mind, for having done some considerable damage unto the enemy, which was always his most
            ardent desire. The huge impatience wherewith Captain Morgan had waited now this long
            while for some of his ships, which were not yet arrived, made him resolve to set sail
            without them, and steer his course for the isle of Savona, the place he had always
            designed. Being arrived there, and not finding any of his ships as yet come, he was more
            impatient and concerned than before, as fearing their loss, or that he must proceed
            without them. Nothwithstanding, he waited for their arrival some few days longer. In the
            meanwhile, having no great plenty of provisions, he sent a crew of 150 men to the isle
            of Hispaniola, to pillage some towns that were nigh unto the city of San Domingo. But
            the Spaniards, having had intelligence of their coming, were now so vigilant and in such
            good posture of defence that the Pirates thought it not convenient to assault them,
            choosing rather to return empty-handed unto Captain Morgan's presence than to perish in
            that desperate enter- prize. At last Captain Morgan, seeing the other ships did not
            come, made a review of his people, and found only five-hundred men, more or less. The
            ships that were wanting were seven, he having only eight in his company, of which the
            greatest part were very small. Thus, having hitherto resolved to cruize upon the coasts
            of Caracas, and plunder all the towns and villages he could meet, finding himself at
            present with such small forces, he changed his resolution, by the advice of a French
            Captain that belonged to his fleet . This Frenchman had served L'Ollonais in like
            enterprizes, and was at the taking of Maracaibo, whereby he knew all the entries,
            passages, 148 THE ISLAND OF RUBA forces, and means how to put in execution the same
            again in the company of Captain Morgan, unto whom, having made a full relation of all,
            he concluded to sack it again the second time, as being himself persuaded, with all his
            men, of the facility the Frenchman propounded. Hereupon they weighed anchor, and steered
            their course towards Curasao. Being come within sight of that island, they landed at
            another, which is nigh unto it, and is called Ruba, seated about twelve leagues from
            Curasao, towards the West. This island is defended but by a slender garrison, and is
            inhabited by Indians, who are subject to the Crown of Spain, and speak Spanish by reason
            of the Roman Catholic religion, which is here cultivated by some few priests that are
            sent from time to time from the neighbour- ing continent. The inhabitants of this isle
            exercise a certain commerce or trade with the Pirates that go and come this way. These
            buy of the islanders sheep, lambs, and kids, which they exchange unto them for hnen,
            thread, and other things of this kind. The country is very dry and barren, the whole
            sub- stance thereof consisting in those three things above-mentioned, and in a small
            quantity of wheat, which is of no bad quality. This isle produces a great number of
            venomous insects, as vipers, spiders, and others. These last are so pernicious here
            that, if any man is bitten by them, he dies mad. And the manner of recovering such
            persons is to tie them very fast both hands and feet, and in this condition to leave
            them for the space of four-and-twenty hours without eating or drinking the least thing
            imaginable. Captain Morgan, as was said, having cast anchor before this island, bought
            of the inhabitants many sheep, lambs, and also wood, which he needed for all his fleet.
            Having been there two days he set sail again, in the time of the night, to the intent
            they might not see what course he steered. The next day they arrived at the sea of
            Maracaibo, having always great care of not being seen from Vigilias, for which reason
            they anchored out of the sight of the watch-tower. Night being come, they set sail again
            towards the land, and the next morning by break of day found themselves directly over
            against the bar of the lake above-mentioned. The Spaniards had built another fort since
            the action of L'Ollonais, whence they did now fire continually against the Pirates,
            while they were JTu Tofvne g^ Fuerto del Brrnc^ tak^ t^r-' Puerto del Principe taken and
            sacked MORGAN SAILS FOR MARACAIBO 151 putting their men into boats for to land. The
            dispute con- tinued very hot on both sides, being managed with huge courage and valour
            from morning till dark night. This being come, Captain Morgan, in the obscurity thereof,
            drew nigh unto the fort ; which having examined, he found nobody in it, the Spaniards
            having deserted it not long before. They left behind them a match kindled nigh unto a
            train of powder, wherewith they designed to blow up the Pirates and the whole fortress,
            as soon as they were in it. This design had taken effect, had the Pirates failed to
            discover it the space of one quarter of an hour. But Captain Morgan prevented the
            mischief by snatching away the match with all speed, whereby he saved both his own and
            his companions' lives. They found here great quantity of powder, whereof he provided his
            fleet ; and afterwards demolished part of the walls, nailing sixteen pieces of ordnance,
            which carried from 12 to 24 pound of bullet. Here they found also great number of
            muskets and military provisions. The next day they commanded the ships to enter the bar
            ; among which, they divided the powder, muskets, and other things they found in the
            fort. These things being done, they embarked again, to continue their course towards
            Maracaibo. But the waters were very low, whereby they could not pass a certain bank that
            lies at the entry of the lake. Hereupon they were compelled to put themselves into
            canoes and small boats, with which they arrived the next day before Maracaibo, having no
            other defence but some small pieces which they could carry in the said boats. Being
            landed, they ran immedi- ately to the fort called De la Barra, which they found in like
            manner as the preceding, without any person in it ; for all were fled before them into
            the woods, leaving also the town without any people, unless a few miserable poor folk
            who had nothing to lose. As soon as they had entered the town, the Pirates searched
            every corner thereof, to see if they could find any people that were hidden who might
            offend them at unawares. Not finding anybody, every party, according as they came out of
            their several ships, chose what houses they pleased to them- selves, the best they could
            find. The church was deputed for the common corps de garde, where they lived after their
            military manner, committing many insolent actions. The next day 152 GIBRALTAR FOUND
            EMPTY after their arrival, they sent a troop of lOo men to seek for the inhabitants and
            their goods. These returned the next day following, bringing with them to the number of
            thirty persons, between men, women, and children, and fifty mules laden with several
            good merchandize. All these miserable prisoners were put to the rack, to make them
            confess where the rest of the inhabitants were and their goods. Amongst other tor- tures
            then used, one was to stretch their hmbs with cords, and at the same time beat them with
            sticks and other instruments. Others had burning matches placed betwixt their fingers,
            which were thus burnt ahve. Others had slender cords or matches twisted about their
            heads, till their eyes burst out of the skull. Thus all sort of inhuman cruelties were
            executed upon those innocent people. Those who would not confess, or who had nothing to
            declare, died under the hands of those tyrannical men. These tortures and racks
            continued for the space of three whole weeks, in which time they ceased not to send out,
            daily, parties of men to seek for more people to torment and rob ; they never returning
            home without booty and new riches. Captain Morgan, having now gotten by degrees into his
            hands about one hundred of the chiefest families, with all their goods, at last resolved
            to go to Gibraltar, even as L'OUonais had done before. With this design he equipped his
            fleet, providing it very sufficiently with all necessary things. He put likewise on
            board all the prisoners ; and thus, weighing anchor, set sail for the said place, with
            resolution to hazard the battle. They had sent before them some prisoners unto
            Gibraltar, to denounce unto the inhabitants they should surrender : other- wise Captain
            Morgan would certainly put them all to the sword, without giving quarter to any person
            he should find alive. Not long after, he arrived with his fleet before Gibraltar, whose
            inhabitants received him with continual shooting of great cannon-bullets. But the
            Pirates, instead of fainting hereat, ceased not to encourage one another, saying : We
            must make one meal upon hitter things before we come to taste the sweetness of the sugar
            this place affords. The next day, very early in the morning, they landed all their men.
            And, being guided by the Frenchman above- mentioned, they marched towards the town, not
            by the com- mon way but crossing through the woods ; which way the TORTURE OF AN
            IMBECILE 153 Spaniards scarce thought they would have come. For, at the beginning of
            their march, they made appearance as if they intended to come the next and open way that
            led unto the town, hereby the better to deceive the Spaniards. But these, remembering as
            j'et full well what hostilities L'Ollonais had committed upon them but two years before,
            thought it not safe to expect the second brunt, and hereupon were all fled out of the
            town as fast as they could, carrying with them all their goods and riches as also all
            the powder, and having nailed all the great guns : insomuch as the Pirates found not one
            person in the whole city, excepting one only poor and innocent man who was born a fool.
            This man they asked whither the inhabitants were fled, and where they had absconded
            their goods. Unto all which questions and the like he constantly made answer : / know
            nothing, I know nothing. But they presently put him to the rack, and tortured him with
            cords ; which torments forced him to cry out : Do not torture me any more, hut come with
            me and I will show you my goods and my riches. They were persuaded, as it should seem,
            he was some rich person who had disguised himself under those clothes so poor as also
            that innocent tongue. Hereupon they went along with him ; and he conducted them to a
            poor and miserable cottage, wherein he had a few earthen dishes and other things of
            little or no value ; and amongst these, three pieces-of-eight, which he had concealed
            with other trumpery underground. After this, they asked him his name, and he readily
            made answer : My name is Don Sebastian Sanchez, and I am brother unto the Governor of
            Maracaibo. This foolish answer, it must be con- ceived, these men, though never so
            inhuman, took for a certain truth. For no sooner had they heard it, but they put him
            again upon the rack, lifting him up on high with cords, and tying huge weights unto his
            feet and neck ; besides which cruel and stretching torment, they burnt him alive,
            appl5dng palm-leaves burning unto his face, under which miseries he died in half-an-
            hour. After his death they cut the cords wherewith they had stretched him, and dragged
            him forth into the adjoining woods, where they left him without burial. The same day
            they sent out a party of Pirates to seek for the inhabitants, upon whom they might
            employ their inhuman cruelties. These brought back with them an honest peasant with two
            daughters of his, whom they had taken prisoners. 154 CAPTAIN MORGAN AT GIBRALTAR and
            whom they intended to torture as they used to do with others, in case they showed not
            the places where the inhabi- tants had absconded themselves. The peasant knew some of
            the said places, and hereupon, seeing himself threatened with the rack, went with the
            Pirates to show them. But the Spaniards, perceiving their enemies to range everywhere up
            and down the woods, were already fled thence much farther off into the thickest parts of
            the said woods, where they built themselves huts, to preserve from the violence of the
            weather those few goods they had carried with them. The Pirates judged themselves to be
            deceived by the said peasant ; and hereupon, to revenge their wrath upon him,
            notwithstanding all the excuses he could make and his humble supplications for his life,
            they hanged him upon a tree. After this, they divided into several parties, and went to
            search the plantations. For they knew the Spaniards that were absconded could not live
            upon what they found in the woods, without coming now and then to seek provisions at
            their own country-houses. Here they found a certain slave, unto whom they promised
            mountains of gold and that they would give him his liberty by transporting him unto
            Jamaica, in case he would show them the places where the inhabitants of Gibraltar lay
            hidden. This fellow conducted them unto a party of Spaniards, whom they instantly made
            all prisoners, commanding the said slave to kill some of them before the eyes of the
            rest ; to the intent that by this perpetrated crime he might never be able to leave
            their wicked company. The negro, according to their orders, committed many murders and
            insolent actions upon the Spaniards, and followed the unfor- tunate traces of the
            Pirates, who, after the space of eight days, returned unto Gibraltar with many prisoners
            and some mules laden with riches. They examined every prisoner by himself (who were in
            all about 250 persons) where they had absconded the rest of their goods, and if they
            knew of their fellow-towns- men. Such as would not confess were tormented after a most
            cruel and inhuman manner. Among the rest, there happened to be a certain Portuguese, who
            by the information of a negro was reported, though falsely, to be very rich. This man
            was commanded to produce his riches. But his answer was, he had no more than 100
            pieces-of-eight in the whole world, and that these had been stolen from him two days
            before by a TORTURE OF A PORTUGUESE 155 servant of his. Which words, although he sealed
            with many oaths and protestations, yet they would not believe. But dragging him unto the
            rack, without any regard unto his age, as being three-score years old, they stretched
            him with cords, breaking both his arms behind his shoulders. This cruelty went not
            alone. For he not being able or will- ing to make any other declaration than the above
            said, they put him to another sort of torment that was worse and more barbarous than the
            preceding. They tied him with small cords by his two thumbs and great-toes unto four
            stakes that were fixed in the ground at a convenient distance, the whole weight of his
            body being pendent in the air upon those cords. Then they thrashed upon the cords with
            great sticks and all their strength, so that the body of this miserable man was ready to
            perish at every stroke, under the severity of those horrible pains. Not satisfied as yet
            with this cruel torture, they took a stone which weighed above 200 pound, and laid it
            upon his belly, as if they intended to press him to death. At which time they also
            kindled palm-leaves, and applied the flame unto the face of this unfortunate Portuguese,
            burning with them the whole skin, beard, and hair. At last these cruel tyrants, seeing
            that neither with these tortures nor others they could get any- thing out of him, they
            untied the cords, and carried him, being almost half-dead, unto the church, where was
            their corps du garde. Here they tied him anew to one of the pillars thereof, leaving him
            in that condition, without giving him either to eat or drink unless very sparingly and
            so little as would scarce sustain life, for some days. Four or five being past, he
            desired that one of the prisoners might have the liberty to come to him, by whose means
            he promised he would endeavour to raise some money to satisfy their demands. The
            prisoner whom he required was brought unto him, and he ordered him to promise the
            Pirates 500 •pieces-of-eight for his ransom. But they were both deaf and obstinate at
            such a small sum, and, instead of accepting it, did beat him cruelly with cudgels,
            saying unto him : Old fellow, instead of 500 you must say 500,000 pieces-of-eight :
            otherwise you shall here end your life. Finally, after a thousand protestations that he
            was but a miserable man and kept a poor tavern for his living, he agreed with them for
            the sum of 1000 pieces-of-eight. These he raised in few days, and, having paid them unto
            the Pirates, 156 SEARCH FOR THE GOVERNOR got his liberty, although so horribly maimed in
            his body that 'tis scarce to be believed he could supervive many weeks after. Several
            other tortures besides these were exercised upon others, which this Portuguese endured
            not. Some were hanged up by the testicles or by their privy members and left in that
            condition till they fell unto the ground, those private parts being torn from their
            bodies. If with this they were minded to show themselves merciful to those wretches,
            thus lacerated in the most tender parts of their bodies, their mercy was to run them
            through and through with their swords, and by this means rid them soon of their pains
            and lives. Other- wise, if this were not done, they used to lie four or five days under
            the agonies of death, before dying. Others were cruci- fied by these tyrants, and with
            kindled matches were burnt between the joints of their fingers and toes. Others had
            their feet put into the fire, and thus were left to be roasted alive. At last, having
            used both these and other cruelties with the white men, they began to practice the same
            over again with the negroes, their slaves, who were treated with no less inhumanity than
            their masters. Among these slaves was found one who promised Captain Morgan to conduct
            him unto a certain river belonging to the lake, where he should find a ship and four
            boats richly laden with goods that belonged unto the inhabitants of Maracaibo. The same
            slave discovered hkewise the place where the Governor of Gibraltar lay hidden, together
            with the greatest part of the women of the town. But all this he revealed, through great
            menaces wherewith they threatened to hang him in case he told not what he knew. Captain
            Morgan sent away presently 200 men in two saeties, or great boats, towards the river
            above-mentioned, to seek for what the slave had discovered. But he himself, with
            two-hundred-and-fifty more, undertook to go and take the Governor. This gentleman was
            retired unto a small island seated in the middle of the river, where he had built a
            little fort, after the best manner he could, for his defence. But hearing that Captain
            Morgan came in person with great forces to seek him, he retired farther off unto the top
            of a moun- tain not much distant from that place ; unto which there was no ascent but by
            a very narrow passage — yea, this was so straight that whosoever did pretend to gain the
            ascent must RETURN TO GIBRALTAR 157 of necessity cause his men to pass one by one.
            Captain Morgan spent two days before he could arrive at the little island
            above-mentioned. Thence he designed to proceed unto the mountain where the Governor was
            posted, had he not been told of the impossibility he should find in the ascent, not only
            of the narrowness of the path that led to the top, but also be- cause the Governor was
            very well provided with all sorts of ammunition above. Besides that, there was fallen an
            huge rain, whereby all the baggage belonging to the Pirates, and their powder, was wet.
            By this rain also they had lost many of their men at the passage over a river that was
            overflown. Here perished likewise some women and children, and many mules laden with
            plate and other goods ; all which they had taken in the fields from the fugitive
            inhabitants. So that all things were in a very bad condition with Captain Morgan, and
            the bodies of his men as much harassed, as ought to be inferred from this relation.
            Whereby, if the Spaniards in that juncture of time had had but a troop of fifty men well
            armed with pikes or spears, they might have entirely destroyed the Pirates, without any
            possible resistance on their side. But the fears which the Spaniards had conceived from
            the begin- ning were so great, that, only hearing the leaves on the trees to stir, they
            often fancied them to be Pirates. Finally, Captain Morgan and his people, having upon
            this march sometimes waded up to their middles in water for the space of half or whole
            miles together, they at last escaped for the greatest part. But of the women and
            children they brought home prisoners, the major part died. Thus twelve days after they
            set forth to seek the Governor, they returned unto Gibraltar with a great number of
            prisoners. Two days after, arrived also the two saeties that went unto the river,
            bringing with them four boats and some prisoners. But, as to the greatest part of the
            merchandize that were in the said boats, they found them not, the Spaniards having
            unladed and secured them, as having intelligence beforehand of the coming of the
            Pirates. Whereupon they designed also, when the merchandize were all taken out, to bum
            the boats. Yet the Spaniards made not so much haste as was requisite to un- lade the
            said vessels, but that they left both in the ship and boats great parcels of goods,
            which, they being fled from thence, the Pirates seized, and brought thereof a
            considerable booty 158 RETURN TO MARACAIBO unto Gibraltar. Thus, after they had been in
            possession of the place five entire weeks, and committed there infinite number of
            murders, robberies, rapes, and suchlike insolences, they concluded upon their departure.
            But, before this could be performed, for the last proof of their t5n:anny they gave
            orders unto some prisoners to go forth into the woods and fields, and collect a ransom
            for the town ; otherwise they would certainly burn every house down to the ground. Those
            poor afflicted men went forth as they were sent. And, after they had searched every
            corner of the adjoining fields and woods, they returned to Captain Morgan, telling him
            they had scarce been able to find anybody. But that unto such as they had found, they
            had proposed his demands, to which had they made answer that the Governor had prohibited
            them to give any ransom for not burning the town. But, notwithstanding any pro- hibition
            to the contrary, they beseeched him to have a little patience, and among themselves they
            would collect to the sum of 5000 pieces-of-eight ; and, for the rest, they would give
            him some of their own townsmen as hostages, whom he might carry with him to Maracaibo,
            till such time as he had received full satisfaction. Captain Morgan, having now been
            long time absent from Maracaibo and knowing the Spaniards had had sufficient time
            wherein to fortify themselves and hinder his departure out of the lake, granted them
            their proposition above-mentioned ; and withal made as much haste as he could to set
            things in order for his departure. He gave liberty to all the prisoners, having
            beforehand put them every one to the ransom ; yet he detained all the slaves with him.
            They delivered unto him four persons that were agreed upon for hostages of what sums of
            money more he was to receive from them ; and they desired to have the slave of whom we
            made mention above, intending to punish him according to his deserts. But Captain Morgan
            would not deliver him, being persuaded they would burn him alive. At last they weighed
            anchor, and set sail with all the haste they could, directing their course towards
            Maracaibo. Here they arrived in four days, and found all things in the same posture they
            had left them when they departed. Yet here they received news, from the information of a
            poor distressed old man, who was sick and whom alone they found in the town, that three
            Spanish men-of-war were SPANISH MEN-OF-WAR 159 arrived at the entry of the lake, and
            there waited for the return of the Pirates out of those parts. Moreover, that the castle
            at the entry thereof was again put into a good posture of defence, being well provided
            with guns and men and all sorts of ammunition. This relation of the old man could not
            choose but cause some disturbance in the mind of Captain Morgan, who now was careful how
            to get away through those narrow passages of the entry of the lake. Hereupon he sent one
            of his boats, the swiftest he had, to view the entry and see if things were as they had
            been related. The next day the boat came back, confirming what was said, and assuring
            they had viewed the ships so nigh that they had been in great danger of the shot they
            made at them. Hereunto they added that the biggest ship was mounted with 40 guns, the
            second with 30, and the smallest with four-and-twenty. These forces were much beyond
            those of Captain Morgan ; and hence they caused a general consternation in all the
            Pirates, whose biggest vessel had not above 14 small guns. Every one judged Captain
            Morgan to despond in his mind and be destitute of all manner of hopes, considering the
            difficulty either of passing safely with his little fleet amidst those great ships and
            the fort, or that he must perish. How to escape any other way by sea or land, they saw
            no opportunity nor convenience. Only they could have wished that those three ships had
            rather come over the lake to seek them at Maracaibo than to remain at the mouth of the
            strait where they were. For at that passage they must of necessity fear the ruin of
            their fleet, which consisted only for the greatest part of boats. Hereupon, being
            necessitated to act as well as he could, Captain Morgan resumed new courage, and
            resolved to show himself as yet undaunted with these terrors. To this intent he boldly
            sent a Spaniard unto the Admiral of those three ships, demanding of him a considerable
            tribute or ransom for not putting the city of Maracaibo to the flame. This man (who
            doubtless was received by the Spaniards with great admiration of the confidence and
            boldness of those Pirates) returned two days after, bringing unto Captain Morgan a
            letter from the said Admiral, whose contents were as follows : — i6o LETTER TO MORGAN
            Letter of Don Alonso del Campo y Espinosa, Admiral of the Spanish Fleet, unto Captain
            Morgan, commander of the pirates. Ha ving understood hy all our friends and neighbours
            the unex- pected news that you have dared to attempt and commit hostilities in the
            countries, cities, towns, and villages belonging unto the dominions of his Catholic
            Majesty, my Sovereign Lord and Master, I let you understand by these lines that I am
            come unto this place, according to my obligation, nigh unto tha .astle which you took
            out of the hands of a parcel of cowards ; where I have put things into a very good
            posture of defence, and tnounted again the artillery which you had nailed and
            dismounted. My intent is to dispute with you your passage out of the lake, and follow
            and pursue you everywhere, to the end you may see the performance of my duty.
            Notwithstanding, if you be contented to surrender with humility all that you have taken,
            together with the slaves and all other prisoners, I will let you freely pass, without
            trouble or molestation ; upon condi' ion that you retire home presently unto your own
            country. But, ' /i case that you make any resistance or opposition unto these thr,„gs
            that I proffer unto you, I do assure you I will command boats to come from Caracas,
            wherein I will put my troops, and, coming to Maracaibo, will cause you utterly to
            perish, by putting you every man to the sword. This is my last and absolute resolution.
            Be prudent, therefore, and do not abuse my bounty with ingratitude. I have with me very
            good soldiers, who desire nothing more ardently than to revenge on you and your people
            all the cruelties and base infamous actions you have committed upon the Spanish nation
            in America. Dated on board the Royal Ship named the Magdalen, lying at anchor at the
            entry of the Lake of Maracaibo, this 24th day of April, 1669. Don Alonso del Campo y
            Espinosa As soon as Captain Morgan had received this letter, he called all his men
            together in the market-place of Maracaibo ; and, after reading the contents thereof,
            both in French and English, he asked their advice and resolutions upon the whole matter,
            and whether they had rather surrender all they had purchased, to obtain their liberty,
            than fight for it. They answered all unanimously^ : They had rather fight, and spill the
            very last drop of blood they had in their veins, than surrender so easily the booty they
            had gotten with so much danger of their lives. Among the rest, one was found who said
            unto MORGAN'S REPLY i6t Captain Morgan : Take you care for the rest, and I will under-
            take to destroy the biggest of those ships with only twelve men. The manner shall be by
            making a brulot, or fire-ship, of that vessel we took in the river of Gibraltar — which,
            to the intent she may not be known for a fire-ship, we will fill her decks with logs of
            wood, standing with hats and montera caps^, to deceive their sight with the
            representation of men. The same we will do at the port-holes that serve for guns, which
            shall be filled with counter- feit cannon. At the stern we will hang out the English
            colours, and persuade the enemy she is one of our best men-of-war that goes to fight
            them. This proposition, being heard by the Junta^, was admitted and approved of by every
            one, howbeit their fears were not quite dispersed. For, notwithstanding what had been
            concluded there, they endeavoured the next day to see if they could come to an
            accommodation with Don Alonso. Unto this effect Captain Morgan sent him two persons,
            with these following proposi- tions. First : That he would quit Maracaibo, without doing
            any damage to the town, nor exacting any ransom for the firing thereof. Secondly : That
            he would set at liberty one half of the slaves, and likewise all other prisoners,
            without ransom. Thirdly : That he would send home freely the four chief inhabi- tants of
            Gibraltar which he had in his custody as hostages for the contributions those people had
            promised to pay. These propo- sitions from the Pirates, being understood by Don Alonso,
            were instantly rejected by every one, as being dishonourable for him to grant. Neither
            would he hear any word more of any other accommodation, but sent back this message :
            That in case they surrendered 7iot themselves voluntarily into his hands within the
            space of two days, under the conditions which he had offered them by his letter, he
            would immediately come and force them to do it. No sooner had Captain Morgan received
            this message from Don Alonso than he put all things in order to fight, resolving to get
            out of the lake by main force, and without surrendering anything. In the first place, he
            commanded all the slaves and * Montera, a Spanish hunting-cap : cf. Hawkins, Voyage to
            the South Seas [i 593-1 622]. § xiii : "... upon their heads they weare a night- capp,
            upon it a montero, and a hat over that." « Junta, Spanish, a meeting, council : cf.
            Howell, Letters [1622], iii, X : " a particular Junta of some of the Counsell of State
            and War might be appointed to determine the businesse." 1 62 PIRATES RESOLVE TO FIGHT
            prisoners to be tied and guarded very well. After this, they gathered all the pitch,
            tar, and brimstone they could find in the whole town, wherewith to prepare the fire-ship
            above- mentioned. Likewise they made several inventions of powder and brimstone, with
            great quantities of. palm-leaves, very well ointed with tar. They covered very well
            their counterfeit cannon, laying under every piece thereof many pounds of powder.
            Besides which, they cut down many outworks belonging to the ship, to the end the powder
            might exert its strength the better. Thus they broke open also new port- holes, where,
            instead of guns they placed little drums, of which the negroes make use. Finally, the
            decks were handsomely beset with many pieces of wood dressed up in the shape of men with
            hats, as monteras, and likewise armed with swords, muskets, and bandoliers. The hrulot,
            or fire-ship, being thus fitted to their purpose, they prepared themselves to go to the
            entry of the port. All the prisoners were put into one great boat, and in another of the
            biggest they placed all the women, plate, jewels, and other rich things which they had.
            Into others, they put all the bales of goods and merchandize, and other things of
            greatest bulk. Each of these boats had twelve men on board, very well armed. The hrulot
            had orders to go before the rest of the vessels, and presently to fall foul with the
            great ship. All things being in readiness. Captain Morgan exacted an oath of all his
            comrades, whereby they protested to defend them- selves against the Spaniards even to
            the last drop of blood, without demanding quarter at any rate : promising them withal
            that whosoever thus behaved himself should be very well rewarded. With this disposition
            of mind and courageous resolution, they set sail to seek the Spaniards on the 30th day
            of April, 1669. They found the Spanish fleet riding at anchor in the middle of the entry
            of the lake. Captain Morgan, it being now late and almost dark, commanded all his
            vessels to come to an anchor, with design to fight thence even all night, if they should
            provoke him thereunto. He gave orders that a careful and vigilant watch should be kept
            on board every vessel till the morning, they being almost within shot, as well as within
            fight, of the enemy. The dawning of the day being come, they weighed anchors, and set
            sail again, steering their ATTEMPT TO TAKE THE CASTLE 165 course directly towards the
            Spaniards, who, observing them to move, did instantly the same. The fire-ship, sailing
            before the rest, fell presently upon the great ship, and grappled to her sides in a
            short while. Which, by the Spaniards being perceived to be a fire-ship, they attempted
            to escape the danger by putting her off ; but in vain, and too late. For the flame
            suddenly seized her timber and tackling, and in a short space consumed all the stern,
            the forepart sinking into the sea, whereby she perished. The second Spanish ship,
            perceiving the Admiral to burn, not by accident but by industry of the enemy, escaped
            towards the castle, where the Spaniards them- selves caused her to sink, choosing this
            way of losing their ship, rather than to fall into the hands of those Pirates, which
            they held for inevitable. The third, as having no oppor- tunity nor time to escape, was
            taken by the Pirates. The sea- men that sank the second ship nigh unto the castle,
            perceiving the Pirates to come towards them to take what remains they could find of
            their ship-wreck (for some part of the bulk was extant above water), set fire in like
            manner unto this vessel, to the end the Pirates might enjoy nothing of that spoil. The
            first ship being set on fire, some of the persons that were in her swam towards the
            shore. These the Pirates would have taken up in their boats, but they would neither ask
            nor admit of any quarter, choosing rather to lose their lives than receive them from the
            hands of' their persecutors, for such reasons as I shall relate hereafter. The Pirates
            were extremely gladded at this signal victory, obtained in so short a time and with so
            great inequality of forces ; whereby they conceived greater pride in their minds than
            they had before. Hereupon they all presently ran ashore, intending to take the castle.
            This they found very well pro- vided both with men, great cannon, and ammunition — they
            having no other arms than muskets and a few fire-balls in their hands. Their own
            artillery they thought incapable, for its smallness, of making any considerable breach
            in the walls. Thus they spent the rest of that day firing at the garrison with their
            muskets till the dusk of the evening, at which time they attempted to advance nigh unto
            the walls, with intent to throw in the fire-balls. But the Spaniards, resolving to sell
            their lives as dear as they could, continued firing so furiously at them that they
            thought it not convenient to approach any 1 66 THE SPANISH PILOT'S DEPOSITION nearer nor
            persist any longer in that dispute. Thus, having experienced the obstinacy of the enemy,
            and seeing thirty of their own men already dead and as many more wounded, they retired
            unto their ships. The Spaniards, believing the Pirates would return the next day to
            renew the attack, as also make use of their own cannon against the castle, laboured very
            hard all night to put things in order for their coming. But more particularly they em-
            ployed themselves that night in digging down and making plain some little hills and
            eminent places whence possibly the castle might be offended. But Captain Morgan intended
            not to come ashore again, busying himself the next day in taking prisoners some of the
            men who still swam alive upon the waters, and hoping to get part of the riches that were
            lost in the two ships that perished. Among the rest he took a certain pilot, who was a
            stranger and who belonged to the lesser ship of the two, with whom he held much
            discourse, inquiring of him several things. Such ques- tions were : What number of
            people those three ships had had in them ? Whether they expected any more ships to come
            ? From what port they set forth the last time, when they came to seek them out ? His
            answer unto all these questions was as follows, which he delivered in the Spanish tongue
            : Noble Sir, be pleased to pardon and spare me, that no evil be done unto me, as being a
            stranger unto this nation I have served, and shall sincerely inform you of all [thaf]
            passed till our arrival at this lake. We were sent by orders from the Supreme Council of
            State in Spain, being 6 men-of-war well equipped into these seas, with instructions to
            cruize upon the English pirates, and root them out from these parts by destroying as
            many of them as we could. These orders were given by reason of the news brought unto the
            Court of Spain of the loss and ruin of Porto Bello and other places. Of all which
            damages and hos- tilities committed here by the English very dismal lamentations have
            oftentimes penetrated the ears of both the Catholic King and Council, unto whom belongs
            the care and preservation of this New World. And, although the Spanish Court has many
            times by their ambassadors sent complaints hereof unto the King of England, yet it has
            been the constant answer of his Majesty of Great Britain : That he never gave any
            letters- patent nor commissions for the acting any hostility whatsoever against the
            subjects of the King of Spain. Hereupon the Catholic THE SPANISH PILOT'S DEPOSITION 167
            King, being resolved to revenge his subjects and punish these proceedings, commanded six
            men-of-war to be equipped, which he sent into these parts under the command of Don
            Augustin de Bustos, who was constituted A dmiral of the said fleet. He commmanded the
            biggest ship thereof, named Na Sa^ de la Soledad, mounted with eight-and-forty great
            guns and eight small ones. The Vice-Admiral was Don Alonso del Campo y Espinosa, who
            commanded the second ship, called La Concepcion, which carried forty-four great guns and
            eight small ones. Besides which vessels, there were also four more, whereof the first
            was named the Magdalen, and was mounted with 36 great guns and 12 small ones, having on
            board 250 men. The second was called St Lewis, with 26 great guns, 12 small ones and 200
            men. The third was called La Marquesa, which carried 16 great guns, 8 small ones and 150
            men. The fourth and last, Na Sa^ del Carmen, with 18 great guns, 8 small ones, and
            likewise 150 men. We were now arrived at Cartagena, when the two greatest ships received
            orders to return into Spain, as being judged too big for cruizing upon these coasts.
            With the four ships remaining, Don Alonso del Campo y Espinosa departed thence towards
            Campeche, to seek out the English. We arrived at the port of the said city, where, being
            surprised by a huge storm that blew from the north we lost one of our four ships, being
            that which I named in the last place among the rest. Hence we set sail for the isle of
            Hispaniola, in sight of which we came within few days, and directed our course unto the
            port of San Domingo. Here we received intelligence there had passed timt way a fleet
            from Jamaica, and that some men thereof having landed at a place called Alta Gracia, the
            inhabitants had taken one of them prisoner , who confessed their whole design was to go
            and pillage the city of Caracas. With these news Don Alonso instantly weighed anchor,
            and set sail thence, crossing over unto the continent, till we came in sight of Caracas.
            Here we found not the English, but happened to meet with a boat which certified us they
            were in the Lake of Maracaibo, and that the fleet consisted of 7 sm^ll ships and one
            boat. Upon this intelligence we arrived here ; and, coming nigh unto the entry of the
            lake, we shot off a gun to demand a pilot from the shore. Those on land, perceiving that
            we were Spaniards, came willingly to us with a pilot, and told us that the English had
            taken the city of Maracaibo, and that they were at present at the pillage of Gibraltar.
            Don Alonso, having understood this news, made a handsome speech to all his soldiers and
            mariners, encouraging them to perform their duty, and withal promising * Nuestra
            Sefiora, Our Lady. 1 68 RANSOM AGAIN DEMANDED to divide among them all they should take
            from the English. After this, he gave order that the guns which we had taken out of the
            ship that was lost should he put into the castle, and there mounted for its defence,
            with 2 pieces more out of his own ship, of i8 pounds port each. The pilots conducted us
            into the port, and Don Alonso commanded the people that were on shore to come unto his
            presence, unto whom he gave orders to repossess the castle, and reinforce it with loo
            men more than it had before its being taken by the English. Not long after, we received
            news that you were returned from Gibraltar unto Maracaibo, unto which place Don Alonso
            wrote you a letter, giving you account of his arrival and design, and withal exhorting
            you to restore all that you had taken. This you refused to do ; whereupon he renewed his
            promises and intentions to his soldiers and seamen. And, having given a very good supper
            unto all his people, he persuaded them neither to take nor give any quarter unto the
            English that should fall into their hands. This was the occasion of so many being
            drowned, who dared not to crave any quarter for their lives, as knowing their own
            intentions of giving none. Two days before you came against us, a certain negro came on
            hoard Don Alonso' s ship, telling him : Sir, be pleased to have great care of yourself ,
            for the English have prepared a fire-ship with desire to burn your fleet. But Don Alonso
            would not believe this intelligence, his answer being : How can that he ? Have they,
            peradventure, wit enough to build a fireship ? or what instruments have they [to] do it
            withal ? The pilot above-mentioned, having related so distinctly all the aforesaid
            things unto Captain Morgan, was very well used by him, and, after some kind proffers
            made unto him, remained in his service. He discovered, moreover, unto Captain Morgan,
            that in the ship which was sunk there was a great quantity of plate, even to the value
            of 40,000 pieces-of-eight ; and that this was certainly the occasion they had oftentimes
            seen the Spaniards in boats about the said ship. Hereupon Captain Morgan ordered that
            one of his ships should remain there to watch all occasions of getting out of the said
            vessel what plate they could. In the meanwhile he himself, with all his fleet, returned
            unto Maracaibo, where he refitted the great ship he had taken of the three
            afore-mentioned. And, now being well accommodated, he chose it for himself, giving his
            own bottom to one of his Captains. After this he sent again a messenger unto the
            Admiral, who THE RANSOM IS PAID 169 was escaped on shore and got into the castle,
            demanding of him a tribute or ransom of fire for the town of Maracaibo ; which being
            denied, he threatened he would entirely consume and destroy it. The Spaniards,
            considering how unfortunate they had been all along with those Pirates, and not knowing
            after what manner to get rid of them, concluded among themselves to pay the said ransom,
            although Don Alonso would not consent unto it. Hereupon they sent unto Captain Morgan to
            ask what sum he demanded. He answered them he would have 30,000 pieces-of -eight, and
            500 beeves, to the intent his fleet might be well victualled with flesh . This ransom
            being paid, he promised in such case he would give no farther trouble unto the
            prisoners, nor cause any ruin or damage unto the town. Finally they agreed with him upon
            the sum of 20,000 pieces-of-eight, besides the 500 beeves. The cattle the Spaniards
            brought in the next day, together with one part of the money. And, while the pirates
            were busied in salting the flesh, they returned with the rest of the whole sum of 20,000
            pieces-of-eight, for which they had agreed. But Captain Morgan would not deliver for
            that present the prisoners, as he had promised to do, by reason he feared the shot of
            the artillery of the castle at his going forth of the lake. Hereupon he told them he
            intended not to deliver them till such time as he was out of that danger, hoping by this
            means to obtain a free passage. Thus he set sail with all his fleet in quest of that
            ship which he had left behind, to seek for the plate of the vessel that was burnt. He
            found her upon the place, with the sum of 15,000 pieces-of-eight, which they had
            purchased out of the wreck, besides many other pieces of plate, as hilts of swords and
            other things of this kind ; also great quantity of pieces-of-eight that were melted and
            run together by the force of the fire of the said ship. Captain Morgan scarce thought
            himself secure, neither could he contrive how to evade the damages the said castle might
            cause unto his fleet. Hereupon he told the prisoners it was necessary they should agree
            with the Governor to open the passage with security for his fleet ; unto which point, if
            he should not consent, he would certainly hang them all up in his ships. After this
            warning the prisoners met together to confer upon the persons they should depute unto
            the said Governor I70 DEPUTATION TO THE GOVERNOR Don Alonso ; and they assigned some few
            among them for that embassy. These went unto him, beseeching and supplicating the
            Admiral he would have compassion and pity on those afflicted prisoners who were as yet,
            together with their wives and children, in the hands of Captain Morgan, and that unto
            this effect he would be pleased to give his word to let the whole fleet of Pirates
            freely pass, without any molestation, forasmuch as this would be the only remedy of
            saving both the lives of them that came with this petition as also of those who remained
            behind in captivity — all being equally menaced with the sword and gallows, in case he
            granted not this humble request. But Don Alonso gave them for answer a sharp
            reprehension of their cowardice, telling them : // you had been as loyal unto your King
            in hindering the entry of these Pirates as I shall do their going out, you had never
            caused these troubles, neither unto yourselves nor unto our whole nation, which have
            suffered so much through your pusillanimity. In a word, I shall never grant your
            request, but shall endeavour to maintain that respect which is due unto my King,
            according to my duty. Thus the Spaniards returned to their fellow-prisoners with much
            consternation of mind and no hopes of obtaining their requests, telling unto Captain
            Morgan what answer they had received. His reply was : If Don Alonso will not let me
            pass, I will find means how to do it without him. Hereupon he began presently to make a
            dividend of all the booty they had taken in that voyage, fearing lest he might not have
            an opportunity of doing it in another place, if any tempest should arise and separate
            the ships, as also being jealous that any of the Com- manders might run away with the
            best part of the spoil which then did lie much more in one vessel than another. Thus
            they all brought in, according to their laws, and declared what they had ; having
            beforehand made an oath not to conceal the least thing from the public. The accounts
            being cast up, they found to the value of 250,000 pieces-of-eight in money and jewels,
            besides the huge quantity of merchandize and slaves : all which purchase was divided
            into every ship or boat, according to its share. The dividend being made, the question
            still remained on foot how they should pass the castle and get out of the lake. Unto
            this effect they made use of a stratagem, of no ill invention, which was as follows. On
            the day that preceded the night MORGAN'S STRATAGEM 171 wherein they determined to get
            forth, they embarked many of their men in canoes, and rowed towards the shore, as if
            they designed to land them. Here they concealed themselves under the branches of trees
            that hang over the coast for a while till they had laid themselves down along in the
            boats. Then the canoes returned unto the ships, with the appearance only of two or three
            men rowing them back, all the rest being concealed at the bottom of the canoes. Thus
            much only could be perceived from the castle ; and this action of false landing of men,
            for so we may call it, was repeated that day several times. Hereby the Spaniards were
            brought into persuasion the Pirates in- tended to force the castle by scaling it, as
            soon as night should come. This fear caused them to place most of their great guns on
            that side which looks towards the land, together with the main force of their arms,
            leaving the contrary side belonging to the sea almost destitute of strength and defence.
            Night being come, they weighed anchor, and by the light of the moon, without setting
            sail, committed themselves to the ebbing tide, which gently brought them down the river,
            till they were nigh unto the castle. Being now almost over against it, they spread their
            sails with all the haste they could possibly make. The Spaniards, perceiving them to
            escape, transported with all speed their guns from the other side of the castle, and
            began to fire very furiously at the Pirates. But these, having a favourable wind, were
            almost past the danger before those of the castle could put things into convenient order
            of offence. So that the Pirates lost not many of their men, nor received any
            considerable damage in their ships. Being now out of the reach of the guns. Captain
            Morgan sent a canoe unto the castle with some of the prisoners ; and the Governor
            thereof gave them a boat that every one might return to his own home. Notwithstanding,
            he detained the hostages he had from Gibraltar, by reason those of that town were not as
            yet come to pay the rest of the ransom for not firing the place. Just as he departed.
            Captain Morgan ordered seven great guns with bullets to be fired against the castle, as
            it were to take his leave of them. But they answered not so much as with a musket- shot.
            The next day after their departure, they were surprised with a great tempest, which
            forced them to cast anchor in the depth of 5 or 6 fathom water. But the storm increased
            so much that 172 ATTEMPT ON COMANA they were compelled to weigh again and put out to
            sea, where they were in great danger of being lost. For if on either side they should
            have been cast on shore, either to fall into the hands of the Spaniards or of the
            Indians, they would certainly have obtained no mercy. At last the tempest being spent,
            the wind ceased, which caused much content and joy in the whole fleet. While Captain
            Morgan made his fortune by pillaging the towns above-mentioned, the rest of his
            companions, who separated from his fleet at the Cape de Lobos for to take the ship of
            which was spoken before, endured much misery, and were very unfortunate in all their
            attempts. For, being arrived at the isle of Savona, they found not Captain Morgan there,
            nor any of their companions. Neither had they the good fortune to find a letter which
            Captain Morgan at his departure left behind him in a certain place where in all prob-
            abiHty they would meet with it. Thus, not knowing what course to steer, they at last
            concluded to pillage some town or other, whereby to seek their fortune. They were in all
            400 men, more or less, who were divided into ships and one boat. Being ready to set
            forth, they constituted an Admiral among themselves, by whom they might be directed in
            the whole affair. Unto this effect they chose a certain person who had be- haved himself
            very courageously at the taking of Porto Bello, and whose name was Captain Hansel. This
            Commander resolved to attempt the taking of the town of Comana, seated nigh upon the
            continent of Caracas, nigh threescore leagues from the West side of the isle of
            Trinidad. Being arrived there, they landed their men, and killed some few Indians that
            were near the coast. But approaching unto the town, the Spaniards, having in their
            company many Indians, dis- puted them the entry so briskly that with great loss and in
            great confusion they were forced to retire towards their ships. At last they arrived at
            Jamaica, where the rest of their companions who came with Captain Morgan ceased not to
            mock and jeer them for their ill success at Comana, often telling them : Let us see what
            money you brought from Comana, and if it he as good silver as that which we bring from
            Maracaibo. The end of the Second Part PART III CHAPTER I Captain Morgan goes to the isle
            of Hispaniola to equip a new fleet, with intent to pillage again upon the coasts of the
            West Indies Captain Morgan perceived now that fortune favoured his arms by giving good
            success to all his enterprizes, which occasioned him, as it is usual in human affairs,
            to aspire to greater things, trusting she would always be constant unto him. Such was
            the burning of Panama, wherein fortune failed not to assist him, in like manner as she
            had done before, crowning the event of his actions with victory, howbeit she had led him
            thereunto through thousands of difficulties. The history hereof I shall now begin to
            relate, as being so much remarkable in all its circumstances as peradventure nothing
            more deserving memory may occur to be read by future ages. Not long after Captain Morgan
            arrived at Jamaica, he found many of his chief officers and soldiers reduced to their
            former state of indigence through their immoderate vices and debauchery. Hence they
            ceased not to importune him for new invasions and exploits, thereby to get something to
            expend anew in wine and strumpets, as they had already wasted what was purchased so
            little before. Captain Morgan, being willing to follow fortune while she called him,
            hereupon stopped the mouths of many of the inhabitants of Jamaica, who were creditors to
            his men for large sums of money, with the hopes and promises he gave them of greater
            achievements than ever by a new expedition he was going about. This being done, he
            needed not give himself much trouble to levy men for this or any other enterprize, his
            name being now so 173 174 MORGAN EQUIPS A NEW FLEET famous through all those islands as
            that alone would readily bring him in more men than he could well employ. He under-
            took, therefore, to equip a new fleet of ships ; for which purpose he assigned the South
            side of the isle of Tortuga as a place of rendezvous. With this resolution, he wrote
            divers letters to all the ancient and expert Pirates there inhabiting, as also to the
            Governor of the said isle, and to the planters and hunters of Hispaniola, giving them to
            understand his intentions, and desiring their appearance at the said place, in case they
            intended to go with him. All these people had no sooner understood his designs but they
            flocked unto the place assigned in huge numbers, with ships, canoes, and boats, being
            desirous to obey his commands. Many who had not the convenience of coming unto him by
            sea traversed the woods of Hispaniola, and with no small difficulties arrived there by
            land. Thus all were present at the place assigned, and in readiness, against the 24th
            day of October, 1670. Captain Morgan was not wanting to be there according to his
            punctual custom, who came in his ship unto the same side of the island, to a port called
            by the French Port Couillon, over against the island De la Vaca, this being the place
            which he had assigned unto others. Having now gathered the greatest part of his fleet,
            he called a council, to deliberate about the means of finding provisions sufficient for
            so many people. Here they concluded to send four ships and one boat, manned with 400
            men, over to the continent, to the intent they should rifle some country-towns and
            villages, and in these get all the corn or maize they could gather. They set sail for
            the con- tinent, towards the river De la Hacha, with design to assault a small village
            called La Rancheria, where is usually to be found the greatest quantity of maize of all
            those parts there- abouts. In the meanwhile Captain Morgan sent another party of his men
            to hunt in the woods, who killed there an huge number of beasts, and salted them. The
            rest of his companions remained in the ships, to clean, fit, and rig them out to sea,
            so, at the return of those who were sent abroad, all things might be in readiness to
            weigh anchor and follow the course of their designs. CHAPTER II What happened in the
            river De la Hacha The four ships above-mentioned, after they had set sail from
            Hispaniola, steered their course till they came within sight of the river De la Hacha,
            where they were suddenly overtaken with a tedious calm. Being thus within sight of land
            becalmed for some days, the Spaniards inhabiting along the coasts, who had perceived
            them to be enemies, had sufficient time to pre- pare themselves for the assault, at
            least to hide the best part of their goods, to the end that, without any care of
            preserving them, they might be in readiness to retire when they found themselves unable
            to resist the force of the Pirates, by whose frequent attempts upon those coasts they
            had already learnt what they had to do in such cases. There was in the river at that
            present a good ship, which was come from Cartagena to lade maize, and was now when the
            Pirates came almost ready to depart. The men belonging to this ship endeavoured to
            escape, but, not being able to do it, both they and the vessel fell into their hands.
            This was a fit purchase for their mind, as being good part of what they came to seek for
            with so much care and toil. The next morning about break of day they came with their
            ships towards the shore, and landed their men, although the Spaniards made huge
            resistance from a battery which they had raised on that side where of necessity they
            were to land ; but, notwithstanding what defence they could make, they were forced to
            retire towards a village, unto which the Pirates followed them. Here the Spaniards,
            rallying again, fell upon them with great fury, and maintained a strong combat, which
            lasted till night was come ; but then, perceiving they had lost great number of men,
            which was no smaller on the Pirates' side, they retired unto places more occult in the
            woods. '7S 176 IN THE RIVER DE LA HACHA The next day when the Pirates saw they were all
            fled, and the town left totally empty of people, they pursued them as far as they could
            possibly. In this pursuit they overtook a party of Spaniards, whom they made all
            prisoners and exer- cised the most cruel torments, to discover where they had hidden
            their goods : some were found who by the force of intolerable tortures confessed, but
            others who would not do the same were used more barbarously than the former. Thus, in
            the space of fifteen days that they remained there, they took many prisoners, much plate
            and movable goods, with all other things they could rob, with which booty they resolved
            to return unto Hispaniola. Yet, not contented with what they had already got, they
            dispatched some prisoners into the woods to seek for the rest of the inhabitants, and to
            demand of them a ransom for not burning the town. Unto this they answered, they had no
            money nor plate ; but, in case they would be satisfied with a certain quantity of maize,
            they would give as much as they could afford. The Pirates accepted this proffer, as
            being more useful to them at that occasion than ready money, and agreed they should pay
            4000 hanegs^ (or bushels) of maize. These were brought in three days after, the
            Spaniards being desirous to rid themselves as soon as possible of that inhuman sort of
            people. Having laded them on board their ships, together with all the rest of their pur-
            chase, they returned unto the island of Hispaniola, to give account unto their leader.
            Captain Morgan, of all they had performed. They had now been absent five entire weeks,
            about the commission aforementioned, which long delay occasioned Captain Morgan almost
            to despair of their return, as fearing lest they were fallen into the hands of the
            Spaniards, especially considering that the place whereunto they went could easily be
            relieved from Cartagena and Santa Maria, if the inhabitants were anything careful to
            alarm the country : on the other side he feared lest they should have made some great
            fortune in that voyage, and with it escaped to some other place. But at last seeing his
            ships return, and in greater number than they had departed, he resumed new courage, this
            sight causing both him and his companions infinite joy. This was much ^ hanega, Portug.
            fanega, a dry measure of capacity, about a bushel to a bushel and a half English.
            FIGHTING STRENGTH OF THE FLEET 177 increased when, being arrived, they found them full
            laden with maize, whereof they stood in great need for the main- tenance of so many
            people, by whose help they expected great matters through the conduct of their
            Commander. After Captain Morgan had divided the said maize, as also the flesh which the
            hunters brought in, among all the ships according to the number of men that were in
            every vessel, he concluded upon the departure, having viewed beforehand every ship, and
            observed their being well equipped and clean. Thus he set sail, and directed his course
            towards Cape Tiburon, where he determined to take his measures and resolution of what
            enterprize he should take in hand. No sooner were they arrived there but they met with
            some other ships that came newly to join them from Jamaica. So that now the whole fleet
            consisted of 37 ships, wherein were 2000 fighting men, besides mariners and boys ; the
            Admiral hereof was mounted with 22 great guns and 6 small ones, of brass ; the rest
            carried some 20, some 16, some 18, and the smallest vessel at least 4, besides which
            they had great quantity of ammunition and fire balls, with other inventions of powder.
            Captain Morgan finding himself with such a great number of ships, divided the whole
            fleet into two squadrons, constituting a Vice-Admiral, and other officers and Commanders
            of the second squadron, distinct from the former. Unto every one of these he gave
            letters patent, or commissions, to act all manner of hostility against the Spanish
            nation, and take of them what ships they could, either abroad at sea or in the harbours,
            in like manner as if they were open and declared enemies (as he termed it) of the King
            of England, his pretended master. This being done, he called all his Captains and other
            officers together, and caused them to sign some articles of common agreement betwixt
            them, and in the name of all. Herein it was stipulated that he should have the hundredth
            part of all that was gotten to himself alone : That every captain should draw the shares
            of eight men, for the expenses of his ship, besides his own : That the surgeon, besides
            his ordinary pay, should have 200 pieces-of-eight, for his chest of medicaments : And
            every carpenter, above his common salary, should draw 100 pieces-of-eight. As to
            recompenses and rewards, they were regulated in this voyage much higher than was
            expressed in the First Part of this book. Thus, for 1 78 DECISION TO ATTACK PANAMA the
            loss of both legs, they assigned 1500 pieces-of-eight or 15 slaves, the choice being
            left to the election of the party ; for the loss of both hands, 1800 pieces-of-eight or
            18 slaves ; for one leg, whether the right or the left, 600 pieces-of-eight or 6 slaves
            ; for a hand, as much as for a leg ; and for the loss of an eye, 100 pieces-of-eight or
            i slave. Lastly, unto him that in any battle should signalize himself , either by
            entering the first any castle, or taking down the Spanish colours and setting up the
            English, they constituted 50 pieces-of-eight for a reward. In the head of these articles
            it was stipulated that all these extraordinary salaries, recompenses, and rewards should
            be paid out of the first spoil or purchase they should take, according as every one
            should then occur to be either rewarded or paid. This contract being signed, Captain
            Morgan commanded his Vice-Admirals and Captains to put all things in order, every one in
            his ship, for to go and attempt one of three places, either Cartagena, Panama, or Vera
            Cruz ; but the lot fell upon Panama as being believed to be the richest of all three :
            not- withstanding this city being situated at such distance from the Northern sea, as
            they knew not well the avenues and entries necessary to approach unto it, they judged it
            necessary to go beforehand to the isle of St Catharine, there to find and pro- vide
            themselves with some persons who might serve them for guides in this enterprize ; for in
            the garrison of that island are commonly employed many banditti and outlaws belonging to
            Panama and the neighbouring places, who are very expert in the knowledge of all that
            country. But, before they pro- ceeded any farther, they caused an act to be published
            through the whole fleet, containing that, in case they met with any Spanish vessel, the
            first Captain who with his men should enter and take the said ship should have for his
            reward the tenth part of whatsoever should be found within her. CHAPTER III Captain
            Morgan leaves the island of Hispaniola, and goes to that of St Catharine, which he takes
            Captain Morgan and his companions weighed anchor from the Cape of Tiburon, the i6th day
            of December in the year 1670. Four days after they arrived within sight of the isle of
            St Catharine, which was now in possession of the Spaniards again, as was said in the
            Second Part of this history, and unto which they commonl banish all the malefactors of
            the Spanish dominions in the West Indies. In this island are found huge quantities of
            pigeons at certain seasons of the year ; it is watered continually by four rivulets or
            brooks, whereof two are always dry in the summer season. Here is no manner of trade nor
            commerce exercised by the inhabitants, neither do they give themselves the trouble to
            plant more fruits than what are necessary for the sustentation of human life ; how- beit
            the country would be sufficient to make very good plan- tations of tobacco, which might
            render considerable profit, were it cultivated for that use. As soon as Captain Morgan
            came nigh unto the island with his fleet, he sent before one of his best sailing vessels
            to view the entry of the river and see if any other ships were there who might hinder
            him from landing ; as also fearing lest they should give intelligence of his arrival to
            the inhabitants of the island, and they by this means prevent his designs. The next day
            before sunrise, all the fleet came to anchor nigh unto the island, in a certain bay
            called Aguada Grande : upon this bay the Spaniards had lately built a battery, mounted
            with four pieces of cannon. Captain Morgan landed with 1000 men, more or less, and
            disposed them into squadrons, beginning his march through the woods, although they had
            no other guides than some few of his own men who had been there 179 i8o GREAT HARDSHIPS
            ENDURED before when Mansvelt took and ransacked the island. The same day they came unto
            a certain place where the Governor at other times did keep his ordinary residence : here
            they found a battery called The Platform, but nobody in it, the Spaniards having retired
            unto the lesser island, which, as was said before, is so nigh' unto the great one that a
            short bridge only may conjoin them. This lesser island aforesaid was so well fortified
            with forts and batteries round about it as might seem impregnable. Hereupon, as soon as
            the Spaniards perceived the pirates to approach, they began to fire upon them so
            furiously that they could advance nothing that day, but were contented to retreat a
            little, and take up their rest upon the grass in the open fields, which afforded no
            strange beds to these people, as being suffi- ciently used to such kind of repose : what
            most afflicted them was hunger, having not eaten the least thing that whole day. About
            midnight it began to rain so hard that those miserable people had much ado to resist so
            much hardship, the greatest part of them having no other clothes than a pair of seaman's
            trousers or breeches and a shirt, without either shoes or stockings. Thus finding
            themselves in great extremity, they began to pull down a few thatched houses to make
            fires withal : in a word, they were in such condition that one hundred men,
            indifferently well armed, might easily that night have torn them all in pieces. The next
            morning about break of day the rain ceased, at which time they began to dry their arms,
            which were entirely wet, and proceed on their march. But not long after, the rain
            recommenced anew, rather harder than before, as if the skies were melted into waters,
            which caused them to cease from advancing towards the forts, whence the Spaniards did
            continually fire at the Pirates, seeing them to approach. The Pirates were now reduced
            unto great affliction and danger of their lives through the hardness of the weather,
            their own nakedness, and the great hunger they sustained. For a small relief hereof,
            they happened to find in the fields an old horse, which was both lean and full of scabs
            and blotches, with galled back and sides. This horrid animal they instantly killed and
            flayed, and divided into small pieces among them- selves as far as it would reach, for
            man}^ could not obtain one morsel, which they roasted and devoured without either salt
            or GOVERNOR BETRAYS THE ISLAND i8i bread, more like unto ravenous wolves than men. The
            rain as yet ceased not to fall, and Captain Morgan perceivedtheir minds to relent,
            hearing many of them say they would return on board the ships. Amongst these fatigues
            both of mind and body, he thought it convenient to use some sudden and almost unexpected
            remedy : unto this effect he commanded a canoe to be rigged in all haste, and colours of
            truce to be hanged out of it. This canoe he sent to the Spanish Governor of the island
            with this message : That if within a few hours he delivered not himself and all his men
            into his hands, he did by that messenger swear unto him and all those that were in his
            company, he would most certainly put them all to the sword, without granting quarter to
            any. After noon the canoe returned with this answer : That the Governor desired two
            hours' time to deliberate with his officers in a full council about that affair ; which
            being past, he would give his positive answer to the message. The time now being elapsed
            the said Governor sent two canoes with white colours, and two persons, to treat with
            Captain Morgan ; but before they landed, they demanded of the Pirates two persons as
            hostages of their security. These were readily granted by Captain Morgan, who delivered
            unto them two of his Captains, for a mutual pledge of the security required. With this
            the Spaniards propounded unto Captain Morgan that their Governor in a full assembly had
            resolved to deliver up the island, as not being provided with sufficient forces to
            defend it against such an armada or fleet. But withal he desired that Captain Morgan
            would be pleased to use a certain stratagem of war, for the better saving of his own
            credit and the reputation of his officers both abroad and at home, which should be as
            follows : That Captain Morgan would come with his troops by night, nigh unto the bridge
            that joined the lesser island unto the great one, and there attack the fort of St Jerome
            : that at the same time all the ships of his fleet would draw nigh unto the castle of
            Santa Teresa, and attack it by sea, landing in the meanwhile some more troops near the
            battery called St Matthew : that these troops which were newly landed should by this
            means intercept the Governor by the way, as he endeavoured to pass unto St J erome' s
            fort , and then take him prisoner, using the formality, as if they forced him to deliver
            the said castle ; and that he would lead the English into it, under the fraud of bein^
            his own troops ; that on one side and 1 82 PIRATES TAKE ST CATHARINE t'other there
            should he continual firing at one another, hut without hullets, or at least into the
            air, so that no side might receive any harm hy this device ; that thus having ohtained
            two such consider- ahle jorts, ike chief est of the isle, he needed not take care for
            the rest, which of necessity must fall hy course into his hands. These propositionsy
            every one, were granted by Captain Morgan, upon condition they should see them
            faithfully observed, for otherwise they should be used with all rigour imaginable : this
            they promised to do, and hereupon took their leaves, and returned to give account of
            their negotiation to the Governor. Presently after, Captain Morgan commanded the whole
            fleet to enter the port, and his men to be in readiness for to assault that night the
            castle of St Jerome. Thus the false alarm or battle began with incessant firing of great
            guns from both the castles against the ships, but without bullets, as was said before.
            Then the Pirates landed, and assaulted by night the lesser island, which they took, as
            also possession of both the fortresses, forcing all the Spaniards, in appearance, to fly
            unto the church. Before this assault Captain Morgan had sent word to the Governor he
            should keep all his men together in a body, otherwise, if the Pirates met any straggling
            Spaniards in the streets, they should certainly shoot them. The island being taken by
            this unusual stratagem, and all things put in due order, the Pirates began to make a new
            war against the poultry, cattle, and all sorts of victuals they could find. This was
            their whole employ for some days, scarce thinking of anything else than to kill those
            animals, roast, and eat, and make good cheer, as much as they could possibly attain
            unto. If wood was wanting, they presently fell upon the houses, and, pulling them down,
            made fires with the timber as had been done before in the field. The next day they num-
            bered all the prisoners they had taken upon the whole island, which were found to be in
            all 450 persons, between men, women, and children, viz. 190 soldiers belonging to the
            garrison, 40 inhabitants who were married, 43 children, 34 slaves belonging to the King,
            with 8 children, 8 banditti ; 39 negroes belonging to private persons, with 27 female
            blacks and 34 children. The Pirates disarmed all the Spaniards, and sent them out
            immediately unto the plantations to seek for pro- visions, leaving the women in the
            church, there to exercise their devotions. FORTRESSES OF THE ISLAND 183 Soon after, they
            took a review of the whole island and all the fortresses belonging thereunto, which they
            found to be nine in all, as follows : the fort of St Jerome, nighest unto the bridge,
            had 8 great guns, of twelve, six, and eight pound carriage, together with 6 pipes of
            muskets, every pipe con- taining 10 muskets. Here they found still 60 muskets, with
            sufficient quantity of powder and all other sorts of ammunition. The second fortress,
            called St Matthew, had 3 guns, of 8 pound carriage each. The third and chief est among
            all the rest, named Santa Teresa, had 20 great guns, of 18, 12, 8, and 6 pound carriage,
            with 10 pipes of muskets, like those we said before, and 90 muskets remaining, besides
            all other warlike ammunition. This castle was built with stone and mortar, with very
            thick walls on all sides, and a large ditch round about it of 20-foot depth, the which
            although it was dry was very hard to get over. Here was no entry but through one door,
            which corresponded to the middle of the castle. Within it was a mount or hill, almost
            inaccessible, with four pieces of cannon at the top, whence they could shoot directly
            into the port. On the sea side this castle was impregnable, by reason of the rocks which
            surrounded it and the sea beating furiously upon them. In like manner, on the side of
            the land, it was so commodiously seated on a mountain that there was no access to it but
            by a path of three or four foot broad. The fourth fortress was named St Augustine,
            having 3 guns, of eight and six pound carriage. The fifth, named La Plattaforma de la
            Concepcion, had only 2 guns, of eight pound carriage. The sixth, by name San Salvador,
            had likewise no more than 2 guns. The seventh, being called Plattaforma de los
            Artilleros, had also 2 guns. The eight, called Santa Cruz, had 3 guns. The ninth, which
            was called St Joseph's Fort, had 6 guns, of twelve and eight pound carriage, besides two
            pipes of muskets and sufficient ammunition. In the storehouse were found above
            thirty-thousand pound of powder, with all other sorts of ammunition, which were
            transported by the Pirates on board the ships. All the guns were stopped and nailed, and
            the fortresses demolished, excepting that of St Jerome, where the Pirates kept their
            guard and residence. Captain Morgan inquired if any banditti were there from Panama or
            Porto Bello ; and hereupon three were brought before him, who pretended to be very
            expert in all 1 84 BANDITTI ENGAGED AS GUIDES the avenues of those parts. He asked them
            if they would be his guides and show him the securest ways and passages unto Panama ;
            which if they performed, he promised them equal shares in all they should pillage and
            rob in that expedition, and that afterwards he would set them at liberty by trans-
            porting them unto Jamaica. These propositions pleased the banditti very well, and they
            readily accepted his proffers, promising to serve him very faithfully in all he should
            desire ; especially one of these three, who was the greatest rogue, thief, and assassin
            among them, and who had deserved for his crimes rather to be broken alive upon the wheel
            than punished with serving in a garrison. This wicked fellow had a great ascendancy over
            the other two banditti, and could domineer and command over them as he pleased, they not
            daring to refuse obedience to his orders. Hereupon Captain Morgan commanded four ships
            and one boat to be equipped and provided with all things necessary, for to go and take
            the castle of Chagre, seated upon the river of that name. Neither would he go himself
            with his whole fleet, fearing lest the Spaniards should be jealous of his farther
            designs upon Panama. In these vessels he caused to embark 400 men, who went to put in
            execution the orders of their chief Commander Captain Morgan, while he himself remained
            be- hind in the island of St Catharine, with the rest of the fleet, expecting to hear
            the success of their arms. CHAPTER IV Captain Morgan takes the castle of Chagre with
            four hundred men sent unto this purpose from the Isle of St Catharine Captain Morgan,
            sending these four ships and a boat to the river of Chagre, chose for Vice-Admiral
            thereof a certain person named Captain Brodely. This man had been a long time in those
            quarters, and committed many robberies upon the Spaniards when Mansvelt took the isle of
            St Catharine, as was related in the Second Part of the history. He, being thereof well
            acquainted with those coasts, was thought a fit person for this exploit, his actions
            Hkewise having rendered him famous among the Pirates and their enemies the Spaniards.
            Captain Brodely being chosen Chief Commander of these forces, in three days after he
            departed from the presence of Captain Morgan arrived within sight of the said castle of
            Chagre, which by the Spaniards is called St Lawrence. This castle is built upon a high
            mountain, at the entry of the river, and surrounded on all sides with strong palisades,
            or wooden walls, being very well terre-pleined^, and filled with earth, which renders
            them as secure as the best walls made of stone or brick. The top of this mountain is in
            a manner divided into two parts, between which lies a ditch of the depth of thirty-
            foot. The castle itself has but one entry, and that by a draw- bridge which passes over
            the ditch aforementioned. On the land-side it had four bastions, that of the sea
            containing only two more. That part thereof which looks towards the South is totally
            inaccessible and impossible to be climbed, through the infinite asperity of the
            mountain. The North side is 1 A French fortification term — the platform on top of a
            rampart : cf. " If it fall so out that you cannot make trauerses vppon the terre-
            plaine, for that the enemy doth hinder it . . ."-—Garrard, Art of Warre [1591]. p. 317.
            ^8| 1 86 THE CASTLE OF CHAGRE surrounded by the river, which hereabouts runs very broad.
            At the foot of the said castle, or rather mountain, is seated a strong fort, with eight
            great guns ; which commands and impedes the entry of the river. Not much lower are to be
            seen two other batteries, whereof each has 6 pieces of cannon, to defend likewise the
            mouth of the said river. At one side of the castle are built two great storehouses, in
            which are de- posited all sorts of warlike ammunition and merchandize, which are brought
            thither from the inner parts of the country. Nigh unto these houses is a high pair of
            stairs, hewed out of the rock, which serves to mount unto the top of the castle. On the
            West side of the said fortress lies a small port, which is not above seven or eight
            fathom deep, being very fit for small vessels, and of very good anchorage. Besides this,
            there lies before the castle, at the entry of the river, a great rock, scarce to be
            perceived above water, unless at low tides. No sooner had the Spaniards perceived the
            Pirates to come but they began to fire incessantly at them with the biggest of their
            guns. They came to an anchor in a small port, at the distance of a league more or less
            from the castle. The next morning very early they went on shore, and marched through the
            woods, to attack the castle on that side. This march continued until two of the clock of
            the afternoon before they could reach the castle, by reason of the difficulties of the
            way, and its mire and dirt. And, although their guides served them exactly,
            notwithstanding they came so nigh the castle at first that they lost many of their men
            with the shot from the guns, they being in an open place where nothing could cover nor
            defend them. This much perplexed the Pirates in their minds, they not knowing what to
            do, nor what course to take, for on that side of necessity they must make the assault,
            and, being uncovered from head to foot, they could not advance one step without great
            danger. Besides that, the castle, both for its situation and strength, did cause them
            much to fear the success of that enterprize. But to give it over they dared not, lest
            they should be reproached and scorned by their companions. At last, after many doubts
            and disputes among themselves, they resolved to hazard the assault and their lives after
            a most desperate manner. Thus they advanced towards the castle, ASSAULT ON THE CASTLE
            187 with their swords in one hand and fire-balls in the other. The Spaniards defended
            themselves very briskly, ceasing not to fire at them with their great guns and muskets
            continually, crying withal : Come on, ye English dogs, enemies to God and our King ; let
            your other companions that are behind come on too : ye shall not go to Panama this bout.
            After the Pirates had made some trial to chmb up the walls, they were forced to retreat,
            which they accordingly did, resting themselves until night. This being come, they
            returned to the assault, to try if by the help of their fire-balls they could overcome
            and pull down the pales before the wall. This they attempted to do, and while they were
            about it there happened a very remark- able accident, which gave them the opportunity of
            the victory. One of the Pirates was wounded with an arrow in his back, which pierced his
            body to the other side. This instantly he pulled out with great valour at the side of
            his breast : then, taking a little cotton that he had about him, he wound it about the
            said arrow, and putting it into his musket, he shot it back into the castle. But the
            cotton, being kindled by the powder, occasioned two or three houses that were within the
            castle, as being thatched with palm-leaves, to take fire, which the Spaniards perceived
            not so soon as was necessary. For this fire, meeting with a parcel of powder, blew it
            up, and thereby caused great ruin, and no less consternation, to the Spaniards, who were
            not able to occur unto ^ this accident, not having seen the beginning thereof. Thus the
            Pirates, perceiving the good effect of the arrow and the beginning of the misfortune of
            the Spaniards, were infinitely gladded thereat. And, while they were busied in
            extinguish- ing the fire, which caused great confusion in the whole castle, having not
            sufficient water wherewithal to do it, the Pirates made use of this opportunity, setting
            fire likewise unto the palisades. Thus the fire was seen at the same time in several
            parts about the castle, which gave them huge advantage against the Spaniards. For many
            breaches were made at once by the fire among the pales, great heaps of earth falling
            down into the ditch. Upon these the Pirates climbed up, and got over into the castle,
            notwithstanding that some Spaniards who were not busied about the fire cast down upon
            them many flaming pots, full of combustible matter » Latin occurrere, to meet, prevent,
            counteract. 1 88 FIRING THE PALISADES and odious smells, which occasioned the loss of
            many of the English. The Spaniards, notwithstanding the great resistance they made,
            could not hinder the palisades from being entirely burnt before midnight. Meanwhile the
            Pirates ceased not to persist in their intention of taking the castle. Unto which
            effect, although the fire was great, they would creep upon the ground as nigh unto it as
            they could, and shoot amidst the flames against the Spaniards they could perceive on the
            other side, and thus cause many to fall dead from the walls. When day was come, they
            observed all the movable earth that lay be- twixt the pales to be fallen into the ditch
            in huge quantity. So that now those within the castle did in a manner lie equally
            exposed to them without, as had been on the contrary before. Whereupon the Pirates
            continued shooting very furiously against them, and killed great numbers of Spaniards.
            For the Governor had given them orders not to retire from those posts which corresponded
            to the heaps of earth fallen into the ditch, and caused the artillery to be transported
            unto the breeches. Notwithstanding, the fire within the castle still continued, and now
            the Pirates from abroad used what means they could to hinder its progress, by shooting
            incessantly against it. One party of the Pirates was employed only to this purpose, and
            another commanded to watch all the motions of the Spaniards, and take all opportunities
            against them. About noon the English happened to gain a breach, which the Gover- nor
            himself defended with twenty-five soldiers. Here was performed a very courageous and
            warlike resistance by the Spaniards, both with muskets, pikes, stones, and swords. Yet,
            notwithstanding, through all these arms the Pirates forced and fought their way, till at
            last they gained the castle. The Spaniards who remained alive cast themselves down from
            the castle into the sea, choosing rather to die precipitated by their own selves (few or
            none surviving the fall) than to ask any quarter for their lives. The Governor himself
            retreated unto the corps du garde, before which were placed two pieces of cannon. Here
            he intended still to defend himself ; neither would he demand any quarter. But at last
            he was killed with a musket-shot, which pierced his skull into the brain. The Governor
            being dead, and the corps du garde surrendered, CAPTURE OF THE CASTLE 189 they found
            still remaining in it alive to the number of thirty men, whereof scarce ten were not
            wounded. These informed the Pirates that eight or nine of their soldiers had deserted
            their colours, and were gone to Panama to carry news of their arrival and invasion.
            These thirty men alone were remain- ing of 314 wherewith the castle was garrisoned,
            among which number not one officer was found alive. These were all made prisoners, and
            compelled to tell whatsoever they knew of their designs and enterprizes. Among other
            things they declared that the Governor of Panama had notice sent him three weeks ago
            from Cartagena, how that the English were equipping a fleet at Hispaniola, with design
            to came to take the said city of Panama. Moreover, that this their intention had been
            known by a person who was run away from the Pirates, at the river De la Hacha, where
            they provided their fleet with corn. That, upon this news, the said Governor had sent
            164 men to strengthen the garrison of that castle, together with much provision and
            warlike ammunition ; the ordinary garrison whereof did only consist of 150 men ; so that
            in all they made the number aforementioned of 314 men, being all very well armed.
            Besides this they declared that the Governor of Panama had placed several ambuscades all
            along the river of Chagre ; and that he waited for their coming in the open fields of
            Panama, with 3600 men. The taking of this castle of Chagre cost the Pirates exces-
            sively dear in comparison to the small numbers they used to lose at other times and
            places : yea, their toil and labour here did far exceed what they sustained at the
            conquest of the isle of St Catharine and its adjacent. For, coming to number their men,
            they found they had lost above 100, besides those that were wounded, whose number
            exceeded 70 . They commanded the Spaniards that were prisoners to cast all the dead
            bodies of their own men down from the top of the mountain to the seaside, and afterwards
            to bury them. Such as were wounded were carried unto the church belonging to the castle,
            of which they made an hospital, and where also they shut up the women. Thus it was
            likewise turned into a place of prostitution, the Pirates ceasing not to defile the
            bodies of those afilicted widows with all manner of insolent actions and threats.
            Captain Morgan remained not long time behind at the isle of St Catharine, after taking
            the castle of Chagre ; of which he I90 ARRIVAL OF CAPTAIN MORGAN had noticed presently
            sent him. Yet notwithstanding, before he departed thence, he caused to be embarked all
            the pro- visions [that] could be found, together with great quantities of maize, or
            Indian wheat, and cassava, whereof in like manner is made bread in those parts. He
            commanded likewise great store of provisions should be transported unto the garrison of
            the aforesaid castle of Chagre, from what parts soever they could be gotten. At a
            certain place of the island they cast into the sea all guns belonging thereto, with a
            design to return and leave that island well garrisoned, unto the perpetual posses- sion
            of Pirates. Notwithstanding, he ordered all the houses and forts to be set on fire,
            excepting only the castle of St Teresa, which he judged to be the strongest and securest
            wherein to fortify himself at his return from Panama. He carried with him all the
            prisoners of the island, and thus set sail for the river of Chagre, where he arrived in
            the space of eight days. Here the joy of the whole fleet was so great, when they spied
            the English colours upon the castle, that they minded not their way into the river,
            which occasioned them to lose four of their ships at the entry thereof, that wherein
            Captain Morgan went being one of the four. Yet their fortune was so good as to be able
            to save all the men and goods that were in the said vessels — yea, the ships likewise
            had been preserved, if a strong northerly wind had not risen on that occasion, which
            cast the ships upon the rock above-mentioned that lies at the entry of the said river.
            Captain Morgan was brought into the castle with great acclamations of triumph and joy of
            all the Pirates, both of those who were within and also them that were but newly come.
            Having understood the whole transactions of the conquest, he commanded all the prisoners
            to begin to work and repair what was necessary — especially in setting up new palisades,
            or pales, round about the forts depending on the castle. There were still in the river
            some Spanish vessels, called by them chatten, which serve for the transportation of
            merchandize up and down the said river, as also for to go to Porto Bello and Nicaragua.
            These are commonly mounted with 2 great guns of iron and 4 other small ones of brass.
            All these vessels they seized on, together with 4 little ships they found there, and all
            the canoes. In the castle they left a garrison of 500 men, and in the ships within the
            river one- MORGAN DEPARTS FOR PANAMA 191 hundred-and-fifty more. These things being
            done, Captain Morgan departed towards Panama, at the head of twelve hundred men. He
            carried very small provisions with him, being in good hopes he should provide himself
            sufficiently among the Spaniards, whom he knew to lie in ambuscade at several places by
            the way. CHAPTER V Captain Morgan departs from the Castle of Chagre, at the head of
            tivelve hundred men, with design to take the city of Panama Captain Morgan set forth
            from the castle of Chagre, to- wards Panama, the i8th day of August in the year 1670. He
            had under his conduct 1200 men, 5 boats with artillery and 32 canoes, all which were
            filled with the said people. Thus he steered his course up the river towards Panama.
            That day they sailed only six leagues, and came to a place called De los Bracos. Here a
            party of his men went on shore, only to sleep some few hours and stretch their limbs,
            they being almost crippled with lying too much crowded in the boats. After they had
            rested a while, they went abroad to see if any victuals could be found in the
            neighbouring plantations. But they could find none, the Spaniards being fled and carry-
            ing with them all the provisions they had. This day, being the first of their journey,
            there was amongst them such scarcity of victuals that the greatest part were forced to
            pass with only a pipe of tobacco, without any other refreshment. The next day, very
            early in the morning, they continued their journey, and came about evening to a place
            called Cruz de Juan Gallego. Here they were compelled to leave their boats and canoes,
            by reason the river was very dry for want of rain and the many obstacles of trees that
            were fallen into it. The guides told them that about two leagues farther on the country
            would be very good to continue the journey by land. Hereupon they left some companies,
            being in all 160 men, on board the boats to defend them, with intent they might serve
            for a place of refuge in case of necessity. The next morning, being the third day of
            their journey, they all went ashore, excepting those above-mentioned who were to keep
            the boats. Unto these Captain Morgan gave very strict orders, under great penalties,
            that no man, upon 192 PIRATES* JOURNEY TO PANAMA 195 any pretext whatsoever should dare
            to leave the boats and go ashore. This he did, fearing lest they should be surprised and
            cut off by an ambuscade of Spaniards that might chance to lie thereabouts in the
            neighbouring woods, which appeared so thick as to seem almost impenetrable. Having this
            morning begun their march, they found the ways so dirty and irksome that Captain Morgan
            thought it more convenient to transport some of the men in canoes (though it could not
            be done without great labour) to a place farther up the river called Cedro Bueno. Thus
            they re-embarked, and the canoes returned for the rest that were left behind. So that
            about night they found themselves altogether at the said place. The Pirates were
            extremely desirous to meet any Spaniards or Indians, hoping to fill their bellies with
            what provisions they should take from them ; for now they were reduced almost to the
            very extremity of hunger. On the fourth day, the greatest part of the Pirates marched by
            land, being led by one of the guides. The rest went by water, farther up with the
            canoes, being conducted by another guide, who always went before them with two of the
            said canoes, to discover on both sides the river the ambuscades of the Spaniards. These
            had also spies, who were very dexter- ous, and could at any time give notice of all
            accidents or of the arrival of the Pirates six hours at least before they came to any
            place. This day about noon they found themselves nigh unto a post called Torna Cavallos.
            Here the guide of the canoes began to cry aloud he perceived an ambuscade. His voice
            caused infinite joy unto all the Pirates, as persuading themselves they should find some
            provisions wherewith to satiate their hunger, which was very great. Being come unto the
            place, they found nobody in it, the Spaniards who were there not long before being every
            one fled, and leaving nothing behind unless it were a small number of leather bags, all
            empty, and a few crumbs of bread scattered upon the ground where they had eaten. Being
            angry at this misfortune, they pulled down a few little huts which the Spaniards had
            made, and afterwards fell to eating the leathern bags, as being desirous to afford
            something to the ferment of their stomachs, which now was grown so sharp that it did
            gnaw their very bowels, having nothing else to prey upon. Thus they made a huge banquet
            upon those bags of leather, which doubtless had been more 196 TRACES OF FURTHER
            AMBUSCADES grateful unto them if divers quarrels had not risen concerning ' who should
            have the greatest share. By the circumference of the place, they conjectured 500
            Spaniards, more or less, had been there. And these, finding no victuals, they were now
            infinitely desirous to meet, intending to devour some of them rather than perish : whom
            they would certainly in that occasion have roasted or boiled, to satisfy their famine,
            had they been able to take them. After they had feasted themselves with those pieces of
            leather, they quitted the place, and marched farther on till they came about night to
            another post called Torna Munni. Here they found another ambuscade, but as barren and
            desert as the former. They searched the neighbouring woods, but could not find the least
            thing to eat, the Spaniards having been so provident as not to leave behind them
            anywhere the least crumb of sustenance, whereby the Pirates were now brought to the
            extremity aforementioned. Here again he was happy that had reserved since noon any small
            piece of leather whereof to make his supper, drinking after it a good draught of water
            for his greatest comfort. Some persons who never were out of their mothers' kitchens may
            ask how these Pirates could eat, swallow, and digest those pieces of leather, so hard
            and dry : unto whom I only answer : That could they once experiment what hunger, or
            rather famine, is, they would certainly find the manner, by their own necessity, as the
            Pirates did. For these first took the leather, and sliced it in pieces. Then did they
            beat it between two stones, and rub it, often dipping it in the water of the river to
            render it by these means supple and tender. Lastly, they scraped off the hair, and
            roasted or broiled it upon the fire. And, being thus cooked, they cut it into small
            morsels, and eat it, helping it down with frequent gulps of water, which by good fortune
            they had nigh at hand. They continued their march the fifth day, and about noon came
            unto a place called Barbacoa. Here Hkewise they found traces of another ambuscade, but
            the place totally as unprovided as the two preceding were. At a small distance were to
            be seen several plantations, which they searched very narrowly, but could not find any
            person, animal, or other thing that was capable of relieving their extreme and ravenous
            hunger. Finally, having ranged up and down and searched a SIXTH DAY OF THE MARCH 197
            long time, they found a certain grotto which seemed to be but lately hewn out of a rock,
            in the which they found two sacks of meal, wheat, and Hke things, with two great jars of
            wine, and certain fruits called planfanos^. Captain Morgan, know- ing that some of his
            men were now through the extremity of hunger reduced almost to the extremity of their
            lives, and fearing lest the major part should be brought into the same condition, caused
            all that was found to be distributed amongst them who were in greatest necessity. Having
            refreshed themselves with these victuals, they began to march anew with greater courage
            than ever. Such as could not well go for weakness were put into the canoes, and those
            commanded to land that were in them before. Thus they prosecuted their journey till late
            at night, at which time they came unto a plantation where they took up their rest ; but
            without eating anything at all, for the Spaniards, as before, had swept away all manner
            of provisions, leaving not behind them the least signs of victuals. On the sixth day
            they continued their march, part of them by land through the woods, and part by water in
            the canoes : howbeit they were constrained to rest themselves very fre- quently by the
            way, both for the ruggedness thereof and the extreme weakness they were under. Unto this
            they endeav- oured to occur^, by eating some leaves of trees and green herbs or grass
            such as they could pick, for such was the miserable condition they were in. This day, at
            noon, they arrived at a plantation, where they found a barn full of maize. Immed- iately
            they beat down the doors, and fell to eating of it dry, as much as they could devour.
            Afterwards they distributed great quantity, giving unto every man a good allowance
            there- of. Being thus provided, they prosecuted their journey, which having continued
            for the space of an hour or thereabouts, they met with an ambuscade of Indians. This
            they no sooner had discovered but they threw away their maize, with the sudden hopes
            they conceived of finding all things in abundance. But, after all this haste, they found
            themselves much deceived, they meeting neither Indians, nor victuals, nor anything else

            notwithstanding on the other side of the river a troop of 100 Indians, more or less, who
            all escaped away through the agility of their feet. Some few Pirates there were who
            leapt into the river, the sooner to reach the shore, to see if they could take any of
            the said Indians prisoners. But all was in vain ; for, being much more nimble at their
            feet than the Pirates, they easily baffled their endeavours. Neither did they only
            baffle them, but killed also two or three of the Pirates with their arrows, howting^ at
            them at a distance, and crying : Ha ! perros, a la savana, a la savana ! Ha, ye dogs !
            go to the plain ; go to the plain ! This day they could advance no farther, by reason
            they were necessitated to pass the river hereabouts to continue their march on the other
            side. Hereupon they took up their repose for that night : howbeit their sleep was not
            heavy nor pro- found, for great murmurings were heard that night in the camp, many
            complaining of Captain Morgan and his conduct in that enterprize, and being desirous to
            return home. On the contrary, others would rather die there than go back one step from
            what they had undertaken. But others who had greater courage than any of these two
            parties did laugh and joke at all their discourses. In the meanwhile they had a guide
            who much comforted them, saying : It would not he long before they met with people from
            whom they should reap some consider- able advantage. The seventh day in the morning they
            all made clean their arms, and every one discharged his pistol or musket, without
            bullet, to examine the security of their firelocks. This being done, they passed to the
            other side of the river in the canoes, leaving the post where they had rested the night
            before, called Santa Cruz. Thus they proceeded on their journey till noon, at which time
            they arrived at a village called Cruz. Being at a great distance as yet from the place,
            they perceived much smoke to arise out of the chimneys. The sight hereof afforded them
            great joy and hopes of finding people in the town, and afterwards what they most
            desired, which was plenty of good cheer. Thus they went on with as much haste as they
            could, making several arguments to one another upon ^ hooting : cf. Nash, Pierce
            Penilesse [1592] : " The people poynted at her for a murtherer, yonge children howted at
            her as a strumpet." An onomatopoeic word. THEY REACH A DESERTED VILLAGE 199 those
            external signs, though all like castles built in the air. For (said they) there is smoke
            coming out of every house — therefore they are making good fires, for to roast and boil
            what we are to eat. With other things to this purpose. At length they arrived there in
            great haste, all sweating and panting, but found no person in the town, nor anything
            that was eatable wherewith to refresh themselves, unless it were good fires to warm
            themselves, which they wanted not. For the Spaniards before their departure had every
            one set fire to his own house, excepting only the storehouses and stables belonging to
            the King. They had not left behind them any beast whatsoever, either alive or dead. This
            occasioned much confusion in their minds, they not finding the least thing to lay hold
            on, unless it were some few cats and dogs, which they immediately killed and devoured
            with great appetite. At last in the King's stables they found by good fortune fifteen or
            sixteen jars of Peru wine, and a leather sack full of bread. But no sooner had they
            begun to drink of the said wine when they fell sick, almost every man. This sudden
            disaster made them think that the wine was poisoned, which caused a new consternation in
            the whole camp, as judging themselves now to be irrecoverably lost. But the true reason
            was their huge want of sustenance in that whole voyage, and the manifold sorts of trash
            which they had eaten upon that occasion. Their sickness was so great that day as caused
            them to remain there till the next morning, without being able to prosecute their
            journey, as they used to do, in the afternoon. This village is seated in the latitude of
            9 degrees and 2 minutes North, being distant from the river of Chagre 26 Spanish
            leagues, and 8 from Panama. Moreover, this is the last place unto which boats or canoes
            can come ; for which reason they built here storehouses, wherein to keep all sorts of
            merchandize, which hence to and from Panama are transported upon the backs of mules.
            Here, therefore. Captain Morgan was constrained to leave his canoes and land all his
            men, though never so weak in their bodies. But, lest the canoes should be surprized or
            take up too many men for their defence, he resolved to send them all back to the place
            where the boats were, excepting one, which he caused to be hidden, to the intent it
            might serve to carry intelligence according to the exigence of affairs. Many 200 EIGHTH
            DAY OF THE MARCH of the Spaniards and Indians belonging to this village were fled unto
            the plantations thereabouts. Hereupon Captain Morgan gave express orders that none
            should dare to go out of the village except in whole companies of lOO together. The
            occasion hereof was his fear lest the enemies should take an advantage upon his men by
            any sudden assault. Notwith- standing, one party of English soldiers stickled not to
            con- travene these commands, being thereunto tempted with the desire of finding
            victuals. But these were soon glad to fly into the town again, being assaulted with
            great fury by some Spaniards and Indians, who snatched up one of the Pirates, and
            carried him away prisoner. Thus the vigilance and care of Captain Morgan was not
            sufficient to prevent every accident that might happen. On the eighth day in the morning
            Captain Morgan sent 200 men before the body of his army, to discover the way to Panama,
            and see if they had laid any ambuscades therein. Especially considering that the places
            by which they were to pass were very fit for that purpose, the paths being so narrow
            that only ten or twelve persons could march in a file, and oftentimes not so many.
            Having marched about the space of ten hours, they came unto a place called Quebrada
            Obscura. Here, all on a sudden, three or four thousand arrows were shot at them, without
            being able to perceive whence they came or who shot them. The place whence it was
            presumed they were shot was a high rocky mountain, excavated from one side to the other,
            wherein was a grotto that went through it, only capable of admitting one horse or other
            beast laded. This multitude of arrows caused a huge alarm among the Pirates, especially
            because they could not discover the place whence they were discharged. At last, seeing
            no more arrows to appear, they marched a little farther, and entered into a wood. Here
            they perceived some Indians to fly as fast as they could possibly before them, to take
            the advantage of another post, and thence observe the march of the Pirates. There
            remained notwith- standing one troop of Indians upon the place, with full design to
            fight and defend themselves. This combat they performed with huge courage, till such
            time as their Captain fell to the ground wounded, who, although he was now in despair of
            life, yet his valour being greater than his strength, would demand no quarter, but,
            endeavouring to raise himself, with undaunted ENCOUNTER WITH INDIANS 201 mind laid hold
            of his azagaya^, or javeHn, and struck at one of the Pirates. But, before he could
            second the blow, he was shot to death with a pistol. This was also the fate of many of
            his companions, who like good and courageous soldiers lost their lives with their
            Captain, for the defence of their country. The Pirates endeavoured, as much as was
            possible, to lay hold on some of the Indians and take them prisoners. But, they being
            infinitely swifter than the Pirates, everyone escaped, leaving eight Pirates dead upon
            the place and ten wounded : yea, had the Indians been more dexterous in military
            affairs, they might have defended that passage and not let one sole man to pass. Within
            a Httle while after they came to a large campaign-field open and full of variegated
            meadows. Hence they could perceive at a distance before them a parcel of Indians who
            stood on the top of a mountain, very nigh unto the way by which the Pirates were to
            pass. They sent a troop of fifty men, the nimblest they could pick out, to see if they
            could catch any of them and afterwards force them to declare where- abouts their
            companions had their mansions. But all their industry was in vain, for they escaped
            through their nimble- ness, and presently after showed themselves in another place,
            hallooing unto the English, and crying : A la savana, d la savana, cornudos, perros
            Ingleses I — that is. To the plain, to the plain, ye cuckolds, ye English dogs I While
            these things passed, the ten Pirates that were wounded a little before were dressed and
            plastered up. At this place there was a wood, and on each side thereof a mountain. The
            Indians had possessed themselves of the one, and the Pirates took possession of the
            other that was opposite unto it. Captain Morgan was persuaded that in the wood the
            Spaniards had placed an ambuscade, as lying so conveniently for that purpose. Hereupon
            he sent before 200 men to search it. The Spaniards and Indians perceiving the Pirates to
            decend the mountain, did so too, as if they designed to attack them. But, being got into
            the wood out of sight of the Pirates, they disappeared, and were seen no more, leaving
            the passage open to them. * The Spanish form of assegai, a dart or light spear used by

            night there fell a great rain, which caused the Pirates to march th6 faster and seek
            everywhere for houses wherein to preserve their arms from being wet. But the Indians had
            set fire to every one thereabouts, and transported all their cattle unto remote places,
            to the end that the Pirates, finding neither houses nor victuals, might be constrained
            to return homewards. Notwithstanding, after diligent search they found a few little huts
            belonging to shepherds, but in them nothing to eat. These not being capable of holding
            many men, they placed in them out of every company a small number, who kept the arms of
            all the rest of the army. Those who remained in the open field endured much hardship
            that night, the rain not ceasing to fall until the morning. The next morning, about
            break of day, being the ninth of this tedious journey. Captain Morgan continued his
            march while the fresh air of the morning lasted. For the clouds then hanging as yet over
            their heads were much more favourable unto them than the scorching rays of the sun, by
            reason the way was now more difficult and laborious than all the preceding. After two
            hours' march they discovered a troop of about 20 Spaniards, who observed the motions of
            the Pirates. They endeavoured to catch some of them, but could lay hold on none, they
            suddenly disappearing, and absconding themselves in caves among the rocks totally
            unknown to the Pirates. At last they came to a high mountain, which, when they had
            ascended, they discovered from the top thereof the South Sea. This happy sight, as if it
            were the end of their labours, caused infinite joy among all the Pirates. Hence they
            could descry also one ship and six boats, which were set forth from Panama and sailed
            towards the islands of Tavogo and Tavogilla. Having descended this mountain, they came
            unto a vale, in which they found great quantity of cattle, whereof they killed good
            store. Here, while some were employed in killing and flaying of cows, horses, bulls, and
            chiefly asses, of which there was greatest number, others busied themselves in kindling
            of fires and getting wood wherewith to roast them. Thus cutting the flesh of these
            animals into convenient pieces, or goblets^, they threwthem into the fire, and,

            they devoured them with incredible haste and appetite. For such was their hunger that
            they more resembled cannibals than Europeans at this banquet, the blood many times
            running down from their beards unto the middle of their bodies. Having satisfied their
            hunger with these delicious meats, Captain Morgan ordered them to continue the march.
            Here again he sent before the main body 50 men, with intent to take some prisoners, if
            possibly they could. For he seemed now to be much concerned that in nine days' time he
            could not meet one person who might inform him of the condition and forces of the
            Spaniards. About evening they discovered a troop of 200 Spaniards, more or less, who
            hallooed unto the Pirates, but these could not understand what they said. A little while
            after they came the first time within sight of the highest steeple of Panama. This
            steeple they no sooner had discovered but they began to show signs of extreme joy,
            casting up their hats into the air, leaping for mirth, and shouting, even just as if
            they had already obtained the victory and entire accomplish- ment of their designs. All
            their trumpets were sounded and every drum beaten, in token of this universal
            acclamation and huge alacrity of their minds. Thus they pitched their camp for that
            night with general content of the whole army, waiting with impatience for the morning,
            at which time they intended to attack the city. This evening there appeared 50 horse,
            who came out of the city, hearing the noise of the drums and trum- pets of the Pirates,
            to observe, as it was thought, their motions. They came almost within musket-shot of the
            army, being preceded by a trumpet that sounded marvellously well. Those on horseback
            halloed aloud to the Pirates, and threatened them, saying : Perros ! nos veremos I —
            that is, Ye dogs ! we shall meet ye ! Having made this menace, they returned into the
            city, excepting only seven or eight horsemen who remained hovering thereabouts, to watch
            what motions the Pirates made. Immediately after, the city began to fire, and ceased not
            to play with their biggest guns all night long against the camp, but with little or no
            harm unto the Pirates, whom they could not conveniently reach. About this time also the
            200 Span- iards whom the pirates had seen in the afternoon appeared again within sight,

            FORCES up the passages, to the intent no Pirates might escape the hands of their forces.
            But the Pirates, who were now in a manner besieged, instead of conceiving any fear of
            their blockades, as soon as they had placed sentries about their camp, began every one
            to open their satchels, and, without any preparation of napkins or plates, fell to
            eating very heartily the remaining pieces of bulls' and horses' flesh which they had
            reserved since noon. This being done, they laid themselves down to sleep upon the grass
            with great repose and huge satisfaction, expecting only with impatience the dawning of
            the next day. On the tenth day, betimes in the morning, they put all their men into
            convenient order, and with drums and trumpets sounding, continued their march directly
            towards the city. But one of the guides desired Captain Morgan not to take the common
            highway that led thither, fearing lest they should find in it much resistance and many
            ambuscades. He presently took his advice, and chose another way that went through the
            wood, although very irksome and difficult. Thus the Span- iards, perceiving the Pirates
            had taken another way, which they scarce had thought on or believed, were compelled to
            leave their stops and batteries, and come out to meet them. The Governor of Panama put
            his forces in order, consisting of 2 squadrons, 4 regiments of foot, and a huge number
            of wild-bulls, which were driven by a great number of Indians, with some negroes and
            others, to help them. The Pirates, being now upon their march, came unto the top of a
            little hill, whence they had a little prospect of the city and campaign country
            underneath. Here they discovered the forces of the people of Panama extended in battle
            array, which, when they perceived to be so numerous, they were suddenly surprised with
            great fear, much doubt- ing the fortune of the day. Yea, few or none there were but
            wished themselves at home, or at least free from the obligation of that engagement,
            wherein they perceived their lives must be so narrowly concerned. Having been some time
            at a stand, in a wavering condition of mind, they at last reflected upon the straits
            they had brought themselves into, and that now they ought of necessity either to fight
            resolutely or die, for no quarter could be expected from an enemy against whom they had
            committed so many cruelties on all occasions. MARCH ON PANAMA 205 Hereupon they
            encouraged one another, and resolved either to conquer, or spend the very last drop of
            blood in their bodies. Afterwards they divided themselves into three battalions, or
            troops, sending before them one of 200 Buccaneers, which sort of people are infinitely
            dexterous at shooting with guns. Thus the Pirates left the hill and descended, marching
            directly towards the Spaniards, who were posted in a spacious field waiting for their
            coming. As soon as they drew nigh unto them the Spaniards began to shout, and cry : Viva
            el Rey ! — God save the King ! — and immediately their horse began to move against the
            Pirates. But the field being full of quags and very soft underfoot, they could not ply
            to and fro and wheel about, as they desired. The 200 Buccaneers who went before, every
            one putting one knee to the ground, gave them a full volley of shot, wherewith the
            battle was instantly kindled very hot. The Spaniards defended themselves very
            courageously, acting all they could possibly perform to disorder the Pirates. Their
            foot, in Hke manner, endeavoured to second the horse, but were constrained by the
            Pirates to separate from them. Thus, finding themselves frustrated of their designs,
            they attempted to drive the bulls against them at their backs and by this means put them
            into disorder. But the greatest part of that wild cattle ran away, being frightened with
            the noise of the battle. And some few that broke through the English com- panies did no
            other harm than to tear the colours in pieces ; whereas the Buccaneers, shooting them
            dead, left not one to trouble them thereabouts. The battle, having now continued for the
            space of two hours, at the end thereof the greatest part of the Spanish horse was ruined
            and almost all killed. The rest fled away. Which being perceived by the foot, and that
            they could not possibly prevail, they discharged the shot they had in their muskets,
            and, throwing them on the ground, betook themselves to flight, every one which way he
            could run. The Pirates could not possibly follow them, as being too much harassed and
            wearied with the long journey they had lately made. Many of them, not being able to fly
            whither they desired, hid themselves for that present among the shrubs of the sea-side.
            But very unfortunately : for most of them being found out by the Pirates were instantly
            killed without giving quarter to any. Some religious men were brought prisoners before
            Captain 2o6 MARCH ON PANAMA Morgan ; but he, being deaf to their cries and lamentations,
            commanded them all to be immediately pistoled, which was accordingly done. Soon after
            they brought a Captain to his presence, whom he examined very strictly about several
            things, particularly, wherein consisted the forces of those of Panama. Unto which he
            answered : Their whole strength did consist in 400 horse, 24 companies of foot, each
            being of 100 men com- plete, 60 Indians, and some negroes, who were to drive 2000
            wild-bulls and cause them to run over the English camp, and thus by breaking their files
            put them into a total disorder and confusion. He discovered more, that in the city they
            had made trenches and raised batteries in several places, in all which they had placed
            many guns, and that at the entry of the highway which led to the city they had built a
            fort, which was mounted with 8 great guns of brass, and defended by 50 men. Captain
            Morgan, having heard this information, gave orders instantly they should march another
            way. But, before setting forth, he made a review of all his men, whereof he found both
            killed and wounded a considerable number, and much greater than had been believed. Of
            the Spaniards were found 600 dead upon the place, besides the wounded and prisoners. The
            Pirates were nothing discouraged seeing their number so much diminished, but rather
            filled with greater pride than before, perceiving what huge advantage they had obtained
            against their enemies. Thus having rested themselves some while, they prepared to march
            courageously towards the city, plighting their oaths to one another in general they
            would fight till never a man was left alive. With this courage they recommenced their
            march, either to conquer or be conquered, carrying with them all the prisoners. They
            found much difficulty in their approach unto the city. For within the town the Spaniards
            had placed many great guns, at several quarters thereof, some of which were charged with
            small pieces of iron and others with musket- bullets. With all these they saluted the
            Pirates, at their drawing nigh unto the place, and gave them full and frequent
            broadsides, firing at them incessantly. Whence it came to pass that unavoidably they
            lost, at every step they advanced, great numbers of men. But neither these manifest
            dangers of their lives, nor the sight of so many of their own as dropped down
            continually at their sides, could deter them from advan- FALL OF PANAMA 207 cing
            farther, and gaining ground every moment upon the enemy. Thus, although the Spaniards
            never ceased to fire and act the best they could for their defence, yet notwithstanding
            they were forced to deliver the city after the space of three hours' combat. And the
            Pirates, having now possessed themselves thereof, both killed and destroyed as many as
            attempted to make the least opposition against them. The inhabitants had caused the best
            of their goods to be transported unto more remote and occult places. Howbeit they found
            within the city as yet several warehouses, very well stocked with all sorts of
            merchandize, as well silks and cloths as linen, and other things of considerable value.
            As soon as the first fury of their entrance into the city was over. Captain Morgan
            assembled all his men at a certain place which he assigned, and there commanded them
            under very great penalties that none of them should dare to drink or taste any wine. The
            reason he gave for this injunction was because he had received private intelli- gence
            that it had been all poisoned by the Spaniards. How- beit it was the opinion of many
            [that] he gave these prudent orders to prevent the debauchery of his people, which he
            foresaw would be very great at the beginning, after so much hunger sustained by the way
            : fearing withal lest the Spaniards, seeing them in wine, should rally their forces and
            fall upon the city, and use them as inhumanly as they had used the inhabitants before.
            CHAPTER VI Captain Morgan sends several canoes and boats unto the South Sea. He sets
            fire to the city of Panama. Robberies and cruelties committed there by the Pirates till
            their return to the Castle of Chagre Captain Morgan, as soon as he had placed guards at
            several quarters where he thought necessary, both within and without the city of Panama,
            immediately commanded twenty-five men to seize a great boat which had stuck in the mud
            of the port for want of water at a low tide, so that she could not put out to sea. The
            same day, about noon, he caused certain men privately to set fire unto several great
            edifices of the city, nobody knowing whence the fire proceeded nor who were the authors
            thereof, much less what motives persuaded Captain Morgan thereunto, which are as yet
            unknown to this day. The fire increased so fast that before night the greatest part of
            the city was in flame. Captain Morgan endeavoured to make the public believe the
            Spaniards had been the cause thereof, which suspicions he surmised among his own people,
            perceiving they reflected upon him for that action. Many of the Spaniards, as also some
            of the Pirates, used all means possible either to extinguish the flame or, by blowing up
            houses with gunpowder and pulling down others, to stop its progress. But all was in vain
            ; for in less than half-an-hour it consumed a whole street. All the houses of this city
            were built with cedar, being of very curious and magnificent structure, and richly
            adorned within, especially with hangings and paintings, whereof part was already
            transported out of the Pirates' way, and another great part was consumed by the voracity
            of the fire. There belonged unto this city (which is also the head of a bishopric) eight
            monasteries, whereof seven were for men and one for women, two stately churches, and one
            hospital. 208 THE CITY OF PANAMA FIRED 211 The churches and monasteries were all richly
            adorned with altar-pieces and paintings, huge quantity of gods and silver, with other
            precious things ; all which the ecclesiastics had hidden and concealed. Besides which
            ornaments, here were to be seen 2000 houses of magnificent and prodigious building, as
            being all, or the greatest part, inhabited by merchants of that country, who are vastly
            rich. For the rest of the inhabitants of lesser quality and tradesmen, this city
            contained 5000 houses more. Here were also great number of stables, which served for the
            horses and mules that carry all the plate, belonging as well to the King of Spain as to
            private men, towards the coast of the North Sea. The neighbouring fields belonging to
            this city are all cultivated with fertile plantations and pleasant gardens, which afford
            delicious prospects unto the inhabitants the whole year long. The Genoese had in this
            cityof Panama a stately and magnifi- cent house, belonging to their trade and commerce
            of negroes. This building likewise was commanded by Captain Morgan to be set on fire ;
            whereby it was burnt to the very ground. Besides which pile of building there were
            consumed to the number of 200 warehouses and great number of slaves who had hid
            themselves therein, together with an infinite multitude of sacks of meal. The fire of
            all which houses and buildings was seen to continue four weeks after the day it began.
            The Pirates in the meanwhile, at least the greatest part of them, encamped some time
            without the city, fearing and expecting that the Spaniards would come and fight them
            anew. For it was known they had an incomparable number of men more than the Pirates
            were. This occasioned them to keep the field, thereby to preserve their forces united,
            which now were very much diminished by the losses of the preceding battles, as also
            because they had a great many wounded, all which they had put into one of the churches
            which alone remained standing, the rest being consumed by the fire. Moreover, beside
            these decreases of their men, Captain Morgan had sent a convoy of 150 men to the Castle
            of Chagre, to carry the news of his victory obtained against Panama. They saw many times
            whole troops of Spaniards cruize to and fro in the campaign-fields, which gave them
            occasion to suspect their rallying anew. Yet they never had the courage to attempt
            anything against the Pirates. In the afternoon of 212 SEARCHING THE RUINS this fatal day
            Captain Morgan re-entered again the city with his troops, to the intent every one might
            take up his lodgings, which now they could hardly find, very few houses having escaped
            the desolation of the fire. Soon after, they fell to seeking very carefully among the
            ruins and ashes for utensils of plate or gold which peradventure were not quite wasted
            by the flames. And of such things they found no small number in several places,
            especially in wells and cisterns, where the Spaniards had hid them from the covetous
            search of the Pirates. The next day Captain Morgan dispatched away two troops of
            Pirates, of 150 men each, being all very stout soldiers and well armed, with orders to
            seek for the inhabitants of Panama who were escaped from the hands of their enemies.
            These men, having made several excursions up and down the campaign- fields, woods, and
            mountains adjoining to Panama, returned after two days' time, bringing with them above
            200 prisoners, between men, women, and slaves. The same day returned also the boat
            above-mentioned, which Captain Morgan had sent into the South Sea, bringing with her
            three other boats, which they had taken in a little while. But all these prizes they
            could wilhngly have given, yea, although they had em- ployed greater labour into the
            bargain, for one certain galleon, which miraculously escaped their industry, being very
            richly laden with all the King's plate and great quantity of riches of gold, pearl,
            jewels, and other most precious goods, of all the best and richest merchants of Panama.
            On board of this galleon were also the religious women belonging to the nunnery of the
            said city, who had embarked with them all the orna- ments of their church, consisting in
            great quantity of gold, plate, and other things of great value. The strength of this
            galleon was nothing considerable, as having only 7 guns, and 10 or 12 muskets for its
            whole defence, being on the other side very ill provided of victuals and other
            necessaries, with great want of fresh water, and having no more sails than the uppermost
            sails of the main mast. This de- scription of the said ship the Pirates received from
            certain persons, who had spoken with seven mariners belonging to the galleon, at such
            time as they came ashore in the cock-boat to take in fresh water. Hence they concluded
            for certain they might easily have taken the said vessel, had they given SEARCH FOR THE
            RICH GALLEON 213 her chase and pursued her, as they ought to do, especially considering
            the said galleon could not long subsist abroad at sea. But they were impeded from
            following this vastly rich prize by the lascivious exercises wherein they were totally
            at that present involved with women, which unto this effect they had carried with them
            and forced on board their boat. Unto this vice was also joined that of gluttony and
            drunkenness, having plentifully debauched themselves with several sorts of rich wines
            they found there ready to their hands. So that they chose rather to satiate their lust
            and appetite with the things above-mentioned than to lay hold on the occasion of such an
            huge advantage, although this only prize would certainly have been of far greater value
            and consequence unto them than all they purchased at Panama and other places
            thereabouts. The next day, repenting of their negligence and being totally wearied of
            the vices and debaucheries aforesaid, they sent forth to sea another boat well armed, to
            pursue with all speed imaginable the said galleon. But their present care and diligence
            was in vain, the Spaniards who were on board the said ship having received intelligence
            of the danger they were in one or two days before, while the Pirates were cruizing so
            nigh unto them, whereupon they fled unto places more remote and unknown to their
            enemies. Notwithstanding, the Pirates found in the ports of the islands of Tavoga and
            Tavogilla several boats that were laden with many sorts of very good merchandize — all
            which they took and brought unto Panama, where, being arrived, they made an exact
            relation of all that had passed while they were abroad unto Captain Morgan. The
            prisoners confirmed what the Pirates had said, adding thereunto that they un- doubtedly
            knew whereabouts the said galleon might be at the present, but that it was very probable
            they had been relieved before now from other places. These relations stirred up Captain
            Morgan anew to send forth all the boats that were in the port of Panama, with design to
            seek and pursue the said galleon till they could find her. The boats aforesaid, being in
            all four, set sail from Panama, and, having spent eight days in cruizing to and fro and
            searching several ports and creeks, they lost all their hopes of finding what they so
            earnestly sought for. Hereupon they resolved to return unto the isles of Tavoga and
            Tavogilla. Here they found a reasonable good 214 NEW EXCURSIONS OF THE PIRATES ship that
            was newly come from Payta, being laden with cloth, soap, sugar, and biscuit, with 20,000
            pieces-of-eight in ready money. This vessel they instantly seized, not finding the least
            resistance from any person within her. Nigh unto the said ship was also a boat, whereof
            in like manner they possessed themselves. Upon the boat they laded great part of the
            merchandize they had found in the ship, together with some slaves they had taken in the
            said islands. With this purchase they returned unto Panama, something better satisfied
            of their voyage, yet withal much discontented they could not meet with the galleon. The
            convoy which Captain Morgan had sent unto the Castle of Chagre returned much about the
            same time, bringing with them very good news. For while Captain Morgan was upon his
            journey to Panama, those he had left in the Castle of Chagre had sent forth to sea two
            boats to exercize piracy. These happened to meet with a Spanish ship, which they began
            to chase within sight of the Castle. This being perceived by the Pirates that were in
            the Castle, they put forth Spanish colours, thereby to allure and deceive the ship that
            fled before the boats. Thus the poor Spaniards, thinking to refuge themselves under the
            Castle and the guns thereof, by flying into the port were caught in a snare and made
            prisoners, where they thought to find defence. The cargo which was found on board the
            said vessel consisted in victuals and provisions, that were all eat- able things.
            Nothing could be more opportune than this prize for the Castle, where they had begun
            already to experi- ment^ great scarcity of things of this kind. This good fortune of the
            garrison of Chagre gave occasion unto Captain Morgan to remain longer time than he had
            determined at Panama. And hereupon he ordered several new excursions to be made into the
            whole country round about the city. So that, while the Pirates at Panama were employed
            in these expeditions, those at Chagre were busied in exercizing piracy upon the North
            Sea. Captain Morgan used to send forth daily parties of 200 men, to make inroads into
            all the fields and country thereabouts ; and, when one party came back, another
            consisting of 200 more was ready to * Experience. Cf. Day, English Secretary [1586], i :

            PRISONERS 215 go forth. By this means they gathered in a short time huge quantity of
            riches and no lesser number of prisoners. These, being brought into the city, were
            presently put unto the most exquisite tortures imaginable, to make them confess both
            other people's goods and their own. Here it happened that one poor and miserable wretch
            was found in the house of a gentleman of great quality, who had put on, amidst that
            confusion of things, a pair of taffety breeches belonging to his master with a little
            silver key hanging at the strings thereof. This being perceived by the Pirates, they
            immediately asked him where was the cabinet of the said key. His answer was : He knew
            not what was become of it, hut only that, finding those breeches in his master's house,
            he had made bold to wear them. Not being able to extort any other confession out of him,
            they first put him upon the rack, wherewith they inhumanly disjointed his arms. After
            this, they twisted a cord about his forehead, which they wrung so hard that his eyes
            appeared as big as eggs and were ready to fall out of his skull. But neither with these
            torments could they obtain any positive answer to their demands. Whereupon they soon
            after hung him up by the testicles, giving him infinite blows and stripes while he was
            under that intolerable pain and posture of body. After- wards they cut off his nose and
            ears, and singed his face with burning straw, till he could speak nor lament his misery
            no longer. Then, losing all hopes of hearing any confession from his mouth, they
            commanded a negro to run him through with a lance, which put an end to his life and a
            period to their cruel and inhuman tortures. After this execrable manner did many others
            of those miserable prisoners finish their days, the common sport and recreation of these
            Pirates being these and other tragedies not inferior to these. They spared, in these
            their cruelties, no sex nor condition whatsoever. For, as to religious persons and
            priests, they granted them less quarter than unto others, unless they could produce a
            considerable sum of money, capable of being a sufficient ransom. Women themselves were
            no better used, except they would condescend unto the libidinous demands and
            concupiscency of the Pirates. For such as would not consent unto their lust were treated
            with all the rigour and cruelty imaginable. Captain Morgan, their leader and Commander,
            gave them no good example in this point. For, 2i6 HISTORY OF A SPANISH LADY as soon as
            any beautiful woman was brought as a prisoner to his presence, he used all the means he
            could, both of rigour and mildness, to bend her to his lascivious will and pleasure :
            for a confirmation of which assertion, I shall here give my reader a short history of a
            lady whose virtue and constancy ought to be transmitted unto posterity, as a memorable
            example of her sex. Among the prisoners that were brought by the Pirates from the
            islands of Tavoga and Tavogilla, there was found a gentle- woman of good quality, as
            also no less virtue and chastity, who was wife unto one of the richest merchants of all
            those countries. Her years were but few, and her beauty so great as peradventure I may
            doubt whether in all Europe any could be found to surpass her perfections either of
            comeliness or honesty. Her husband, at that present, was absent from home, being gone as
            far as the kingdom of Peru, about great concerns of commerce and trade, wherein his
            employments did lie. This virtuous lady, likewise, hearing that Pirates were coming to
            assault the city of Panama, had absented herself thence in the company of other friends
            and relations, thereby to preserve her life amidst the dangers which the cruelties and
            tyrannies of those hard-hearted enemies did seem to menace unto every citizen. But no
            sooner had she appeared in the presence of Captain Morgan instantly she was designed for
            his voluptuous pleasures and concupiscence. Hereupon he commanded they should lodge her
            in a certain apartment by herself, giving her a negress, or black woman, to wait upon
            her, and that she should be treated with all the respect and regale[ment] due unto her
            quality. The poor afflicted lady did beg, with multitude of sobs and tears, she might be
            suffered to lodge among the other prisoners, her relations, fearing lest that unexpected
            kindness of the Commander might prove to be a design upon her chastity. But Captain
            Morgan would by no means hearken to her petition, and all he commanded, in answer
            thereunto, was she should be treated with more particular care than before, and have her
            victuals carried from his own table. This lady had formerly heard very strange reports
            concerning the Pirates, before their arrival at Panama, intimating unto her, as if they
            were not men, but, as they said, heretics, who did neither invoke the Blessed Trinity
            nor beheve in Jesus Christ. But now she began to have better thoughts of them than ever
            HISTORY OF A SPANISH LADY 217 before, having experimented the manifold civiHties of
            Captain Morgan, especially hearing him many times to swear by the name of God and of
            Jesus Christ, in whom, she was persuaded, they did not believe. Neither did she now
            think them to be so bad, or to have the shapes of beasts, as from the relations of
            several people she had oftentimes heard. For, as to the name of ' robbers ' or ' thieves
            ', which was commonly given them by others, she wondered not much at it, seeing, as she
            said, that among all nations of the universe there were to be found some wicked men who
            naturally coveted to possess the goods of others. Conformable to the persuasion of this
            lady was the opinionof another woman, of weak understanding, at Panama, who used to say,
            before the Pirates came thither, she desired very much and had a great curiosity to see
            one of those men called Pirates, for as much as her husband had often told her that they
            were not men, like others, but rather irrational beasts. This silly woman, at last
            happening to see the first of them, cried out aloud, saying : Jesus bless me ! these
            thieves are like unto us Spaniards. This false civility of Captain Morgan, wherewith he
            used this lady, as a thing very common unto such persons as pretend and cannot obtain,
            was soon after changed into barbarous cruelty. For, three or four days being past, he
            came to see her, and entertained her with dishonest and lascivious discourses, opening
            unto her his ardent desires of enjoying the accomplish- ment of his lust. The virtuous
            lady constantly repulsed him, with all the civility imaginable and many humble and
            modest expressions of her mind. But Captain Morgan still persisted in his disorderly
            request, presenting her withal with much pearl, gold, and all that he had got that was
            precious and valuable in that voyage. But the lady, being in no manner wiUing to consent
            thereunto, nor accept his presents, and showing herself in all respects like unto
            Susannah for constancy, he presently changed note, and began to speak unto her in
            another tone, threatening her with a thousand cruelties and hard usages at his hands.
            Unto all these things she gave this resolute and positive answer, than which no other
            could be extorted from her ; Sir, my life is in your hands ; but, as to my body, in
            relation to that which you would persuade me unto, my soul shall sooner be separated
            from it, through the violence of your arms, than I shall condescend to your request. No
            sooner had 2x8 MUTINY AMONG THE PIRATES Captain Morgan understood this heroic resolution
            of her mind than he commanded her to be stripped of the best of her apparel, and
            imprisoned in a darksome and stinking cellar. Here she had allowed her an extremely
            small quantity of meat and drink, wherewith she had much ado to sustain her life for a
            few days. Under this hardship the constant and virtuous lady ceased not to pray daily
            unto God Almighty for constancy and patience against the cruelties of Captain Morgan.
            But he, being now thoroughly convinced of her chaste resolutions, as also desirous to
            conceal the cause of her confinement and hard usage, since many of the Pirates, his
            companions, did compassionate her condition, laid many false accusations to her charge,
            giving to understand she held inteUigence with the Spaniards, and corresponded with them
            by letters, abusing thereby his former lenity and kindness. I myself was an eye-witness
            unto these things here related, and could never have judged such con- stancy of mind and
            virtuous chastity to be found in the world, if my own eyes and ears had not informed me
            thereof. But of this incomparable lady I shall say something more hereafter in its
            proper place ; whereupon I shall leave her at present, to continue my history. Captain
            Morgan, having now been at Panama the full space of three weeks, commanded all things to
            be put in order for his departure. Unto this effect, he gave orders to every com- pany
            of his men to seek out for so many beasts of carriage as might suffice to convey the
            whole spoil of the city to the river where his canoes lay. About this time a great
            rumour was spread in the city of a considerable number of Pirates who in- tended to
            leave Captain Morgan ; and that, by taking a ship which was in the port, they determined
            to go and rob upon the South Sea till they had got as much as they thought fit, and then
            return homewards by the way of the East Indies into Europe. For which purpose they had
            already gathered great quantity of provisions, which they had hidden in private places,
            with sufficient store of powder, bullets, and all other sorts of ammunition ; likewise
            some great guns belonging to the town, muskets, and other things, wherewith they
            designed not only to equip the said vessel but also to fortify themselves and raise
            batteries in some island or other, which might serve them for a place of refuge. MORGAN
            DEPARTS FROM PANAMA 219 This design had certainly taken effect as they intended, had not
            Captain Morgan had timely advice thereof given him by one of their comrades. Hereupon he
            in- stantly commanded the main-mast of the said ship should be cut down and burnt,
            together with all the other boats that were in the port. Hereby the intentions of all or
            most of his companions were totally frustrated. After this, Captain Morgan sent forth
            many of the Spaniards into the adjoining fields and country, to seek for money wherewith
            to ransom not only themselves but also all the rest of the prisoners, as likewise the
            ecclesiastics, both secular and regular. Moreover, he commanded all the artillery of the
            town to be spoiled, that is to say, nailed and stopped up. At the same time he sent out
            a strong companj^ of men to seek for the Governor of Panama, of whom intelligence was
            brought that he had laid several ambuscades in the way by which he ought to pass at his
            return. But those who were sent upon this design returned soon after, saying they had
            not found any sign or appearance of any such ambuscades; for a confirmation whereof,
            they brought with them some prisoners they had taken, who declared how that the said
            Governor had had an intention of making some opposition by the way, but that the men
            whom he had designed to effect it were unwilling to undertake any such enterprize, so
            that, for want of means, he could not put his design in execution. On the 24th of
            February of the year 1671 Captain Morgan departed from the city of Panama, or rather
            from the place where the said city of Panama did stand ; of the spoils whereof he
            carried with him 175 beasts of carriage, laden with silver, gold, and other precious
            things, besides 600 prisoners, more or less, between men, women, children, and slaves.
            That day they came unto a river that passes through a delicious cam- paign-field, at the
            distance of a league from Panama. Here Captain Morgan put all his forces into good order
            of martial array, in such manner as that the prisoners were in the middle of the camp,
            surrounded on all sides with Pirates. At which present conjuncture nothing else was to
            be heard but lamen- tations, cries, shrieks, and doleful sighs, of so many women and
            children, who were persuaded Captain Morgan designed to transport them all and carry
            them into his own country for slaves. Besides that,, among all those miserable
            prisoners, 220 THE SPANISH LADY LIBERATED there was extreme hunger and thirst endured at
            that time ; which hardship and misery Captain Morgan designedly caused them to sustain,
            with intent to excite them more earnestly to seek for moneys wherewith to ransom
            themselves, according to the tax he had set upon every one. Many of the women begged of
            Captain Morgan upon their knees, with infinite sighs and tears, he would permit to
            return unto Panama ; there to live in company of their dear husbands and children, in
            little huts of straw which they would erect, seeing they had no houses until the
            rebuilding of the city. But his answer was : he came not thither to hear lamentations
            and cries, but rather to seek moneys. Therefore they ought to seek out for that in the
            first place, wherever it were to be had, and bring it to him, otherwise he would
            assuredly transport them all unto such places whither they cared not to go. The next
            day, when the march began, those lamentable cries and shrieks were renewed, in so much
            as it would have caused compassion in the hardest heart to hear them. But Captain
            Morgan, as a man little given to mercy, was not moved there- with in the least. They
            marched in the same order as was said before, one party of the Pirates preceding in the
            van, the prisoners in the middle, and the rest of the Pirates in the rear- guard, by
            whom the miserable Spaniards were, at every step, punched and thrust in their backs and
            sides with the blunt end of their arms, to make them march the faster. That beautiful
            and virtuous lady, of whom we made mention here- tofore, for her unparalleled constancy
            and chastity, was led prisoner by herself, between two Pirates who guarded her. Her
            lamentations now did pierce the skies, seeing herself carried away into foreign
            captivity, often crying unto the Pirates, and telling them : That she had given order
            unto two religious persons, in whom she had relied, to go unto a certain place and fetch
            so much money as her ransom did amount unto. That they had promised faithfully to do it,
            hut, having obtained the said money, instead of bringing it unto her they had employed
            it another way, to ransom some of their own and particular friends. This ill-action of
            theirs was discovered by a slave, who brought a letter unto the said lady. Her
            complaints, and the cause thereof, being brought unto the ears of Captain Morgan, he
            thought fit to inquire thereinto. Having found the thing to be true, especially hearing
            it confirmed by the EVERYONE SEARCHED 221 confession of the said religious men, though
            under some frivolous excuses, of having diverted the money but for a day or two within
            which time they expected more sums to repay it, he gave hberty unto the said lady, whom
            otherwise he designed to transport unto Jamaica. But in the meanwhile he detained the
            said religious men as prisoners in her place, using them according to the deserts of
            their incompassionate intrigues. As soon as Captain Morgan arrived, upon his march, at
            the town called Cruz, seated on the banks of the river Chagre as was mentioned before,
            he commanded an order to be published among the prisoners that within the space of three
            days every one of them should bring in his ransom, under the penalty aforementioned of
            being transported unto Jamaica. In the meanwhile he gave orders for so much rice and
            maize to be collected thereabouts as was necessary for the victuaUing all his ships. At
            this place some of the prisoners were ransomed, but many others could not bring in their
            moneys in so short time. Hereupon he continued his voyage, leaving the village on the
            5th day of March next following, and carrying with him all the spoil that ever he could
            transport. From this village he likewise led away some new prisoners who were
            inhabitants of the said place. So that these prisoners were added unto those of Panama
            who had not as yet paid their ransoms, and all transported. But the two religious men
            who had diverted the money belonging to the lady were ransomed three days after their
            imprisonment, by other persons who had more compassion for their condition than they had
            showed for hers. About the middle of the way unto the Castle of Chagre Captain Morgan
            commanded them to be placed in due order, according to their custom, and caused every
            one to be sworn that they had re- served nor concealed nothing privately to themselves,
            even not so much as the value of sixpence. This being done. Captain Morgan having had
            some experience that those lewd fellows would not much stickle to swear falsely in
            points of interest, he commanded every one to be searched very strictly, both in their
            clothes and satchels and everywhere it might be presumed they had reserved anything.
            Yea, to the intent this order might not be ill taken by his companions, he per- mitted
            himself to be searched, even to the very soles of his shoes. Unto this effect, by common
            consent, there was as- 222 DIVISION OF THE BOOTY signed one out of every company to be
            the searchers of all the rest. The French Pirates that went on this expedition with
            Captain Morgan were not well satisfied with this new custom of searching, Yet their
            number being less than that of the Enghsh, they were forced to submit unto it, as well
            as the others had done before them. The search being over, they re- embarked in their
            canoes and boats, which attended them on the river, and arrived at the Castle of Chagre
            on the 9th day of the said month of March. Here they found all things in good order,
            excepting the wounded men whom they had left there at the time of their departure. For
            of these the greatest number were dead, through the wounds they had received. From
            Chagre Captain Morgan sent presently after his arrival a great boat to Porto Bello,
            wherein were all the prisoners he had taken at the isle of St Catharine, demanding by
            them a considerable ransom for the Castle of Chagre, where he then was, threatening
            otherwise to ruin and demolish it even to the ground. Unto this message those of Porto
            Bello made answer : They would not give one farthing towards the ransom of the said
            castle, and that the English might do with it as they pleased. This answer being come,
            the dividend was made of all the spoil they had purchased in that voyage. Thus every
            com- pany and every particular person therein included received their portion of what
            was gotten, or, rather, what part thereof Captain Morgan was pleased to give them. For
            so it was, that the rest of his companions, even of his own nation, complained of his
            proceedings in this particular, and feared not to tell him openly to his face that he
            had reserved the best jewels to him- self. For they judged it impossible that no greater
            share should belong to them than 200 pieces-of-eight per capita, of so many valuable
            purchases and robberies as they had obtained — which small sum they thought too little
            reward for so much labour and such huge and manifest dangers as they had so often
            exposed their lives unto. But Captain Morgan was deaf unto all these and many other
            complaints of this kind, as having designed in his mind to cheat them of as much as he
            could. At last Captain Morgan, finding himself obnoxious to many obloquies and
            detractions among his people, began to fear the consequence thereof, and hereupon,
            thinking it unsafe to remain any longer time at Chagre, he commanded the ordnance of the
            said Castle to be carried on board his ship. Afterwards MORGAN STEALS AWAY 223 he caused
            the greatest part of the walls to be demolished, and the edifices to be burnt, and as
            many other things spoiled and ruined as could conveniently be done in a short while.
            These orders being performed, he went secretly on board his own ship, without giving any
            notice of his departure unto his companions, nor calling any council, as he used to do.
            Thus he set sail and put out to sea, not bidding anybody adieu, being only followed by
            three or four vessels of the whole fleet. These were such (as the French Pirates
            believed) as went shares with Captain Morgan towards the best and greatest part of the
            spoil which had been concealed from them in the dividend. The Frenchmen could very
            willingly have revenged this affront upon Captain Morgan and those that followed him,
            had they found themselves with sufficient means to encounter him at sea. But they were
            destitute of most things necessary thereunto — yea, they had much ado to find suffi-
            cient victuals and provisions for their voyage to Jamaica, he having left them totally
            unprovided of all things. • CHAPTER VII Of a voyage made by the author along the coasts
            of Costa Rica, at his return towards Jamaica. What happened most remark- able in the
            said voyage. Some observations made by him at that time Captain Morgan left us all in
            such a miserable condition as might serve for a lively representation of what reward
            attends wickedness at the latter end of Hfe — whence we ought to have learned how to
            regulate and amend our actions for the future. However it was, our affairs being reduced
            to such a posture, every company that was left behind, whether English or French, were
            compelled to seek what means they could to help themselves. Thus most of them separated
            from each other, and several companies took several courses at their return homewards.
            As for that party to which I belonged, we steered our voj^age along the coast of Costa
            Rica, where we intended to purchase some provisions and careen our vessel in some secure
            place or other. For the boat wherein we were was now grown so foul as to be rendered
            totally unfit for sailing. In few days we arrived at a great port, called Boca del Toro,
            where are always to be found an huge quantity of good and eatable tortoises. The
            circumference hereof is 10 leagues, more or less, being surrounded with little islands,
            under which vessels may ride very secure from the violence of the winds. The said
            islands are inhabited by Indians, who never could be subjugated by the Spaniards, and
            hence they give them the name of Indios bravos, or Wild Indians. They are divided,
            according to the variety of idioms of their language, into several customs and fashions
            of people, whence arises that they have perpetual wars against one another. Towards the
            east side of this port are found some of them who formerly 224 INDIOS BRAFOS, OR WILD
            INDIANS 225 did much trade with the Pirates, seUing unto them the flesh of divers
            animals which they hunt in their countries, as also all sorts of fruits that the land
            produces. The exchange of which commodities was iron instruments that the Pirates
            brought [with] them, beads, and other toys, whereof they made great account for wearing,
            more than of precious jewels, which they knew not nor esteemed in the least. This
            commerce afterwards failed, because the Pirates committed many bar- barous inhumanities
            against them, killing many of their men on a certain occasion, and taking away their
            women to serve their disordinate lust. These abuses gave sufficient cause for a
            perpetual cessation of all friendship and commerce between them and the Pirates. We went
            ashore with design to seek provisions, our necessity being now almost extreme. But our
            fortune was so bad that we could find nothing else than a few eggs of crocodiles, where-
            with we were forced to content ourselves for that present. Hereupon we left those
            quarters, and steered our course east- wards. Being upon this tack, we met with three
            boats more of our own companions, who had been left behind by Captain Morgan. These told
            us they had been able to find no relief for the extreme hunger they sustained ;
            moreover, that Captain Morgan himself and all his people were already reduced to such
            misery that he could afford them no more allowance than once a day, and that very short
            too. We, therefore, hearing from these boats that Uttle or no good was like to be done
            by sailing farther eastwards, changed our course, and steered towards the west. Here we
            found an excessive quantity of tortoises, more than we needed for the victualling our
            boats, should we be never so long without any other flesh or fish. Having provided
            ourselves with this sort of victuals, the next thing we wanted was fresh water. There
            was enough to be had in the neighbouring islands, but we scarce dared to land on them,
            by reason of the enmity above mentioned between us and the Pirates and those Indians.
            Notwithstanding, necessity having no law, we were forced to do as we could, rather than
            as we desired to do. And hereupon we resolved to go all of us together unto one of the
            said islands. Being landed, one party of our men went to range in the woods, while
            another filled the barrels with water. Scarce one whole hour was past, after our people
            were got 226 ASSAULTED BY THE INDIANS ashore, when suddenly the Indians came upon us,
            and we heard one of our men cry : Arm! arm ! We presently took up our arms, and began to
            fire at them as hot as we could. This caused them to advance no farther, and in a short
            while put them to flight, sheltering themselves, in the woods. We pursued them some part
            of the way, but not far, by reason we then esteemed rather to get in our water than any
            other advantages upon the enemy. Coming back, we found two Indians dead upon the shore,
            whereof the habiUments of one gave us to understand he was a person of quahty amongst
            them. For he had about his body a girdle, or sash, very richly woven ; and on his face
            he wore a beard of massive gold — I mean, a small planch^ of gold hung down at his lips
            by two strings (which penetrated two little holes, made there on purpose) that covered
            his beard, or served instead thereof. His arms were made of sticks of palmetto-trees,
            being very curiously wrought, at one end whereof was a kind of hook, which seemed to be
            hardened with fire. We could willingly have had opportunity to speak with some of these
            Indians, to see if we could reconcile their minds unto us, and by this means renew the
            former trade with them, and obtain pro- visions. But this was a thing impossible,
            through the wildness of their persons and savageness of their minds. Notwith- standing,
            this encounter hindered us not from filling our barrels with water, and carrying them
            aboard. The night following we heard from the shore huge cries and shrieks among the
            Indians. These lamentations caused us to believe, because they were heard so far, they
            had called in much more people to aid them against us ; as, also, that they lamented the
            death of those two men who were killed the day before. These Indians never come upon the
            waters of the sea, neither have they ever given themselves to build canoes or any other
            sort of vessels for navigation — not so much as fisher-boats, of which art of fishery
            they are totally ignorant. At last, having nothing else to hope for in these parts, we
            resolved to depart thence for Jamaica, whither we designed to go. Being set forth, we
            met with contrary winds, which caused us to make use of our oars, and row as far as the
            river of Chagre. When we came nigh unto it, we perceived 1 (plank), slab. Cf. transl. of
            The Conquest of West India [1578], 233 : "... there sawe golde in planches like bricke
            battes." THE SEA-COW 227 a ship that made towards us, and began to give us chase. Our
            apprehensions were that it was a ship from Cartagena, which might be sent to rebuild and
            retake possession of the Castle of Chagre, now all the Pirates were departed thence.
            Hereupon we set all our sail and ran before the wind, to see if we could escape or
            refuge ourselves in any place. But the vessel, being much swifter and cleaner than ours,
            easily got the wind of us, and stopped our course. Then approaching nigh unto us, we
            discovered that they were, and knew them to be our former comrades, in the same
            expedition of Panama, who were but lately set out from Chagre. Their design was to go
            unto Nombre de Dios, and thence to Cartagena, to seek some purchase or other in or about
            that frequented port. But, the wind at that present being contrary to their intention,
            they concluded to go in our company towards the same place where we were before, called
            Boca del Toro. This accident and encounter retarded our journey, in the space of two
            days, more than we could regain in a whole fort- night. This was the occasion that
            obliged us to return to our former station, where we remained for a few days. Thence we
            directed our course for a place called Boca del Dragon, there to make provisions of
            flesh, especially of a certain animal which the Spaniards call maneniines^, and the
            Dutch ' sea- cows *, because the head, nose, and teeth of this beast are very like unto
            those of a cow. They are found commonly in such places as under the depth of the waters
            are very full of grass, on which, it is thought, they do pasture. These animals have no
            ears, and only in place of them are to be seen two little holes, scarce capable of
            receiving the little finger of a man. Nigh unto the neck they have two wings, under
            which are seated two udders or breasts, much like unto the breasts of a woman. The skin
            is very close and united together, resembhng the skin of a Barbary (or Guinea) dog. This
            skin upon the back is of the thickness of two fingers, which, being dried, is as hard as
            any whalebone, and may serve to make walking-staffs withal. The belly is in all things
            Uke unto that of a cow, as far as the kidneys, or reins. Their manner of ^ Manatee,
            Span, tnanati, an aquatic mammal, at one time supposed to have originated the legends of
            the mermaids. Cf. Eden, Decades, section ii (1555) : "... also manates, and murene, and
            manye other fysshes which haue no names in oure language." 22 8 THE SEA-COW engendering,
            likewise, is the same with the usual manner of a land-cow, the male of this kind being
            in simiUtude almost one and the same thing with a bull. Yet, notwithstanding, they
            conceive and breed but once. But the space of time that they go with calf, I could not
            as yet learn. These fishes have the sense of hearing extremely acute, in so much that in
            taking them the fisherman ought not to make the least noise, nor row, unless it be very
            slightly. For this reason they make use of certain instruments for rowing which the
            Indians call pagayos'^, and the Spaniards name caneletas, with which although they row,
            yet it is performed without any noise that can fright the fish. While they are busied in
            this fishery, they use not speak to one another, but all is transacted by signs. He that
            darts them with the javelin uses it after the same manner as when they kill tortoises.
            Howbeit, the point of the said javelin is somewhat different, as having two hooks at the
            extremity, and these longer than that of the other fishery. Of these fishes some are
            found to be of the length of twenty unto twenty-four foot. Their flesh is very good to
            eat, being very like in colour unto that of a land-cow, but in taste unto that of pork.
            It contains much fat, or grease, which the Pirates use to melt and keep in earthen pots,
            to make use thereof instead of oil. On a certain day, wherein we were not able to do any
            good at this sort of fishery, some of our men went into the woods to hunt, and others to
            catch other fish. Soon after we espied a canoe, wherein were two Indians. These no
            sooner had discovered our vessels but they rowed back with all the speed they could
            towards the land, being unwilling to trade or have anything to do with us Pirates. We
            followed them to the shore, but through their natural nimbleness, being much greater
            than ours, they retired into the woods before we could overtake them. Yea, what was more
            admirable, they drew on shore and car- ried with them their canoe into the wood as
            easily as if it were made of straw, although it weighed above 2000 pounds. This we knew
            by the canoe itself, which we found afterwards and had much ado to get it into the water
            again, although we were in all eleven persons to pull at it. ^ Cf. " . . . for this
            reason they use certain instruments for rowing by the Indians called pagayos, with which
            they row without any noise to fright the fish." — Description of the Isthmus of Darien
            [1699], p. 9 — evidently derived from this book. RIO DE ZUERA 229 We had at that time in
            oiir company a certain pilot who had been divers times in those quarters. This man,
            seeing this action of the Indians, told us that some few years before a squadron of
            Pirates happened to arrive at that place. Being there, they went in canoes to catch a
            certain sort of Httle birds, which inhabits the sea-coast under the shade of very
            beautiful trees, which here are to be seen. While they were busied at that work, certain
            Indians who had climbed up into the trees to view their actions, seeing now the canoes
            underneath, leaped down into the sea, and with huge celerity seized some of the canoes
            and Pirates that kept them, both which they transported so nimbly into the remotest
            parts of the woods as that the prisoners could not be relieved by their companions.
            Hereupon the Admiral of the said squadron landed presently after with 500 men, to seek
            and rescue the men he had lost. But they saw such an excessive number of Indians flock
            together to oppose them as obliged them to retreat with all possible diHgence unto their
            ships, concluding among themselves that, if such forces as those could not perform
            anything towards the recovery of their companions, they ought to stay no longer time
            there. Having heard this history, we came away thence, fearing some mischief might
            befall us, and bringing with us the canoe aforementioned. In this we found nothing else
            but a fishing-net, though not very large, and four arrows made of palm-tree, of the
            length of seven-foot each and of the figure, or shape, as follows. ^^^^ TT These arrows
            we believed to be their arms. The canoe we brought away was made of cedar, but very
            roughly hewn and poHshed, which caused us to think that those people have no instruments
            of iron. We left that place, and arrived in twenty-four hours at another called Rio de
            Zeura, where we found some few houses belonging to the city of Cartagena. These houses
            are inhabited by Spaniards, whom we resolved to visit, not being able to find any
            tortoises nor yet any of their eggs. The inhabitants were all fled from the said houses,
            having left no victuals 230 PORCUPINES; PHEASANTS nor provisions behind them, in so much
            that we were forced to content ourselves with a certain fruit, which there is called
            plantano. Of these plantanos we filled our boats, and continued our voyage, coasting
            along the shore. Our design was to find out some creek or bay wherein to careen our
            vessel, which now was very leaky on all sides — yea, in such a dangerous condition that
            both night and day we were constrained to employ several men at the pump, unto which
            purpose we made use of all our slaves. This voyage lasted a whole fort- night, all which
            time we lay under the continual frights of perishing every moment. At last we arrived at
            a certain port called the Bay of Bleevelt, being so named from a pirate who used to
            resort thither with the same design that we did. Here one party of our men went into the
            woods to hunt, while another undertook to refit and careen our vessel. Our companions
            who went abroad to hunt found here- abouts porcupines of a huge and monstrous bigness.
            But their chief exercise was kilhng of monkeys, and certain birds called by the
            Spaniards faisanes, or pheasants. The toil and labour we had in this employment of
            shooting did seem, at least unto me, to be sufficiently compensated with the pleasure of
            killing the said monkeys. For at these we usually made fifteen to sixteen shots before
            we could kill three or four of them, so nimbly would they escape our hands and aim, even
            after being desperately wounded. On the other side, it was delightful to see the female
            monkeys carry their little ones upon their backs, even just as the negresses do their
            children. When any person passes under the trees where these monkeys are sitting, they
            will commonly open their bellies and squirt their excrement upon their heads and
            clothes. Likewise, if shooting at a parcel of them, any monkey happens to be wounded,
            the rest of the company will flock about him, and lay their hands upon the wound, to
            hinder the blood from issuing forth. Others will gather moss that grows upon the trees,
            and thrust it into the wound, and thereby stop the blood. At other times they will
            gather such or such herbs, and, chew- ing them in their mouth, apply them after the
            manner of a poultice, or cataplasm. All which things did cause in me great admiration,
            seeing such strange actions in those irra- tional creatures, which testified the
            fidelity and love they had for one another. INDIANS SLAUGHTER TWO WOMEN 231 On the 9th
            day after our arrival at that place, our v omen- slaves being busied in their ordinary
            employments of washing dishes, sewing, drawing water out of wells, which we had made on
            the shore, and the like things, we heard great cries of one of them, who said she had
            seen a troop of Indians appear towards the woods, whereby she began immediately to cry
            out : Indians ! Indians ! We, hearing this rumour, ran presently to our arms, and their
            relief. But, coming unto the wood, we found no person there excepting two of our women-
            slaves killed upon the place, with the shot of arrows. In their bodies we saw so many
            arrows sticking as might seem they had been fixed there with particular care and
            leisure, for otherwise we knew that one of them alone was sufficient to bereave any
            human body of life. These arrows were all D ^^B rTTTTTTminnnn C \Sq^ ^mmm A. A

            length being eight feet, and their thickness of a man's thumb. At one of the extremi-
            ties hereof was to be seen a hook made of wood and tied to the body of the arrow with a
            string. At the other end was a certain case, or box, like the case of a pair of
            tweezers, in the which we found certain little pebbles, or stones. The colour thereof
            was red, and very shining, as if they had been locked up some considerable time. All
            which, we believed were arms belonging to their captains and leaders. These arrows were
            all made without instruments of iron. For, whatsoever the Indians make, they harden it
            first very artificially with fire, and afterwards polish it with flints. As to the
            nature of these Indians, they are extremely ^ An obsolete name for certain crystalized

            ARROWS robust of constitution, strong and nimble at their feet. We sought them carefully
            up and down the woods, but could not find the least trace of them, neither any of their
            canoes, nor floats, whereof they make use to go out to fish. Hereupon we retired unto
            our vessels, where, having embarked all our goods, we put off from the shore, fearing
            lest finding us there they should return in any considerable number, and over- powering
            our forces tear us all in pieces. CHAPTER VIII The author departs towards the Cape of
            Gracias d Dios, Of the commerce which here the Pirates exercise with the Indians. His
            arrival at the island De los Pinos ; and, finally, his return unto Jamaica The fear we
            had, more than usual, of those Indians above- mentioned, by reason of the death of our
            two women-slaves, of which we told you in the former chapter, occasioned us to depart as
            fast as we could from that place. We directed our course thence towards the Cape of
            Gracias d Dios, where we had fixed our last hopes of finding provisions. For thither do
            usually resort many Pirates, who entertain a friendly correspondence and trade with the
            Indians of those parts. Being arrived at the said cape, we hugely rejoiced, and gave
            thanks unto God Almighty, for having delivered us out of so many dangers and brought us
            unto this place of refuge, where we found people who showed us most cordial friendship,
            and provided us with all necessaries whatsoever. The custom of this island is such that,
            when any Pirates arrive there, every one has the liberty to buy for himself an Indian
            woman, at the price of a knife or any old axe, wood-bill, or hatchet. By this contract
            the woman is obliged to remain in the custody of the Pirate all the time he stays there.
            She serves him in the meanwhile, and brings him victuals of all sorts that the country
            affords. The Pirate, moreover, has liberty to go when he pleases, either to hunt, or
            fish, or about any other divertisements of his pleasure ; but withal is not to commit
            any hostility, or depredation upon the inhabitants, seeing the Indians bring him in all
            that he stands in need of, or that he desires. Through the frequent converse and
            familiarity these Indians have with the Pirates, they sometimes use to go to sea with
            233 2 34 INDIANS OF GRACIAS A DIOS them, and remain among them for whole years, without
            re- turning home. Whence it comes that many of them can speak Enghsh and French, and
            some of the Pirates their Indian language. They are very dexterous at darting with the
            javelin, whereby they are very useful to the Pirates towards the victualling their
            ships, by the fishery of tortoises, and manitas, a sort of fish so called by the
            Spaniards. For one of these Indians is alone sufficient to victual a vessel of an
            hundred persons. We had among our crew two Pirates who could speak very well the Indian
            language. By the help of these men I was so curious [as] to inquire into their customs,
            lives, and policy, whereof I shall give you here a biief account. This island contains
            about thirty leagues in circumference, more or less. It is governed after the form of a
            little common- wealth, they having no king nor sovereign-prince among them. Neither do
            they entertain any friendship or correspondence with other neighbouring islands, much
            less with the Spaniards. They are in all but a small nation, whose number does not
            exceed sixteen or seventeen hundred persons. They have among them some few negroes, who
            serve them in quality of slaves. These happened to arrive there, swimming, after
            shipwreck made upon that coast. For, being bound for Terra Firma in a ship that carried
            them to be sold in those parts, they killed the Captain and mariners, with design to
            return unto their country. But, through their ignorance in marinery, they stranded their
            vessel hereabouts. Although, as I said before, they make but a small nation, yet they
            live divided, as it were, into two several provinces. Of these, the one sort employ
            themselves in cultivating the ground and making several plantations ; but the others are
            so lazy that they have not courage to build themselves huts, much less houses, to dwell
            in. They frequent chiefly the sea-coast, wandering disorderly up and down, without
            knowing or caring so much as to cover their bodies from the rains, which are very
            frequent in those parts, unless it be with a few palm-leaves. These they put upon their
            heads, and keep their backs always turned to the wind that blows. They use no other
            clothes than an apron, which being tied to their middle, cometh down so far as to hide
            the shameful parts of their bodies. Such aprons are made of the rinds of trees, which
            they strongly beat upon stones till they are softened. Of these same they make use
            INDIANS OF GRACIAS A DIGS 235 for bed-clothes, to cover themselves when they sleep. Some
            make to themselves bed-clothes of cotton, but these are but few in number. Their usual
            arms are nothing but azagayas, or spears, which they make fit for their use with points
            of iron or teeth of crocodiles. They know, after some manner, that there is a God, yet
            they live without any reHgion or divine worship. Yea, as far as I can learn, they
            believe not in nor serve the devil, as many other nations of America do both believe,
            invoke, and worship him. Hereby they are not so much tormented by him as other nations
            are. Their ordinary food, for the greatest part, con- sists in several fruits, such as
            are called bananas, racoven, ananas, potatoes, cassava ; as also crabs, and some few
            fish of other sorts, which they kill in the sea with darts. As to their drink, they are
            something expert in making certain pleasant and delicate Hquors. The commonest among
            them is called achioc. This is made of a certain seed of palm-tree, which they bruise
            and afterwards steep or infuse in hot water, till it be settled at the bottom. This
            liquor, being strained off, has a very pleasant taste, and is very nourishing. Many
            other sorts of Hquors they prepare, which I shall omit for brevity. Only I shall say
            something, in short, of that which is made of plantanos. These they knead betwixt their
            hands with hot water, and afterwards put into great calabashes, which they fill up with
            cold water, and leave in repose for the space of eight days, during which time it
            ferments as well as the best sort of wine. This liquor they drink for pleasure, and as a
            great regale[ment], in so much that, when these Indians invite their friends or
            relations, they cannot treat them better than to give them some of this pleasant drink.
            They are very unskilful in dressing of victuals ; and hence it is that they very seldom
            treat one another with banquets. For this purpose, when they go or send to any house to
            invite others, they desire them to come and drink of their liquors. Before the invited
            persons come to their house, those that expect them comb their hair very well, and
            anoint their faces with oil of palm mingled with a certain black tincture, which renders
            them very hideous. The women, in Hke manner, daub their faces with another sort of
            stuff, which causes them to look as red as crimson. And such are the greatest civiUties
            thev use in their ornaments and attire. Afterwards, he that 236 INDIAN SOCIAL CUSTOMS
            invites the other takes his arms, which are three or four azagayas, and goes out of his
            cottage the space of three or four hundred steps, to wait for and receive the persons
            that are to come to visit him. As soon as they draw nigh unto him, he falls down upon
            the ground, lying flat on his face, in which posture he remains without any motion, as
            if he were dead. Being thus prostrate before them, the invited friends take him up and
            set him on his feet, and thus they go altogether unto the hut. Here the persons who are
            invited use the same ceremony, falhng down on the ground, as the inviter did before. But
            he lifts them up one bj^ one, and, giving them his hand, cpnducts them into his cottage,
            where he causes them to sit. The women on these occasions perform few or no ceremonies.
            Being thus brought into the house, they are presented every one with a calabash full of
            the liquor above-mentioned, made of plantanos, which is very thick, almost like unto
            water- gruel, or children's pap, wherein is contained four quarts, more or less, of the
            said liquor. These they are to drink off as well as they can, and get down at any rate.
            The calabashes being emptied into their stomachs, the master of the house, with many
            ceremonies, goes about the room, and gathers his calabashes. And this drinking hitherto
            is reckoned but for one welcome, whereas every invitation ought to contain several
            welcomes. Afterwards, they begin to drink of the clear liquor above-mentioned, for which
            they were called to this treat. Hereunto follow many songs and dances and a thousand
            caresses to the women that are present : in so much that oftentimes, for a testimony of
            their great love unto them, they take their darts and with the points thereof pierce and
            wound their genital parts. This relation I confess I could not believe, though
            oftentimes it had been certified unto me, until such time as my own eyes were witnesses
            unto these and the like actions. Neither only on this occasion do they perform this
            ceremony of piercing their genitals, but also when they make love unto any woman,
            intending thereby to let them understand the greatness of their affection and constancy.
            They use not to marry any young maid without the consent of her parents. Hereupon, if
            any one desires to take a wife, he is first examined by the damsel's father concerning
            several points relating to good husbandry. These are most commonly : MARRIAGE AND BIRTH
            CUSTOMS 237 whether he can make azagayas, darts for fishing, or spin a certain thread
            which they use about their arrows. Having answered to satisfaction, the examiner calls
            to his daughter, for a little calabash full of the liquor above-mentioned. Of this he
            drinks first ; then gives the cup unto the young man ; and he finally unto the bride,
            who drinks it up ; and with this only ceremony the marriage is made. When any one drinks
            to the health of another, the second person ought to drink up the liquor which the other
            person has left in the calabash. But, in case of marriage, as was said before, it is
            consumed alone among those three, the bride obtaining the greatest part to her share.
            When the woman lies in, neither she nor her husband observe the time, as is customary
            among the Caribbees. But, as soon as the woman is delivered, she goes instantly unto the
            next river, brook, or fountain, and washes the new-born creature, swaddling it up
            afterwards in certain rollers, or swaddling bands, which there are called cabalas. This
            being done, she goes about her ordinary labour, as before. At their entertainments it is
            usual that, when the man dies, his wife buries him with all his azagayas, aprons, and
            jewels that he used to wear at his ears. Her next obligation is to come every day to her
            husband's grave, bringing him meat and drink for a whole year together. Their years they
            reckon by the moons, allowing fifteen to every year, which make their entire circle, as
            our twelve months make ours. Some historians writing of the Caribbee Islands do afirm
            that this ceremony of carrying victuals to the dead is generally observed among them.
            Moreover, that the devil comes unto the sepulchres, and carries away all the meat and
            drink which is placed there. But I myself am not of this opinion, seeing I have
            oftentimes with my own hands taken away these offerings, and eaten them instead of other
            victuals. Unto this I was moved, because I knew that the fruits used on these occasions
            were the choicest and ripest of all others, as also the hquors of the best sort they
            made use of for their greatest regale[ment] and pleasure. When the widow has thus com-
            pleted her year, she opens the grave, and takes out all her husband's bones. These she
            scrapes and washes very well, and afterwards dries against the beams of the sun. When
            they are sufficiently dried, she ties them all together, and puts them 238 FISHING AND
            HUNTING into a cabala, being a certain pouch or satchel, and is obliged for another year
            to carry them upon her back in the daytime, and to sleep upon them in the night, until
            the year be com- pletely expired. This ceremony being finished, she hangs up the bag and
            bones against the post of her own door, in case she be mistress of any house. But,
            having no house of her own, she hangs them at the door of her next neighbour or
            relation. The widows cannot marry a second time, according to the laws or customs of
            this nation, until the whole space of the two years above-mentioned be completed. The
            men are bound to perform no such ceremonies towards their wives. But, if any Pirate
            marries an Indian Woman, she is bound to do with him in all things as if he were an
            Indian man born. Then negroes that are upon this island live here in all respects
            according to the customs of their own country. All these things I have thought fit to
            take notice of in this place, though briefly, as judging them worthy the curiosity of
            some judicious and inquisitive persons. Now I shall continue the account of our voyage.
            After that we had refreshed and provided ourselves, as well as we could, at the island
            aforesaid, we departed thence, and steered our course towards the island De los Pinos.
            Here we arrived in fifteen days, and were constrained to refit again our vessel, which
            now the second time was very leaky and not fit for sailing any farther. Hereupon we
            divided our- selves, as before, and some went about that work of careening the ship,
            while others betook themselves to fishing. In this last we were so successful as to take
            in six or seven hours as much fish as would abundantly suffice to feed a thousand per-
            sons. We had in our company some Indians from the cape of Gracias a Dios, who were very
            dexterous both in hunting and fishing. With the help of these men we killed likewise in
            a short while and salted a huge number of wild-cows, sufficient both to satiate our
            hungry appetites and to victual our vessel for the sea. These cows were formerly brought
            into this island by the Spaniards, with design they should here mul- tiply and stock the
            country with cattle of this kind. We salted in like manner a vast number of tortoises,
            whereof in this island huge quantities are to be found. With these things our former
            cares and troubles began to dissipate, and our minds to be so far recreated as to forget
            the m' series we had lately FIGHT WITH A CROCODILE 239 endured. Hereupon we began to
            call one another again by the name of brothers, which was customary amongst us, but had
            been disused in our miseries and scarce remembered without regret. All the time we
            continued here, we feasted ourselves very plentifully, without the least fear of
            enemies. For as to the Spaniards that were upon the island, they were here in mutual
            league and friendship with us. Thus we were only constrained to keep watch and ward
            every night, for fear of the crocodiles, which are here in great plenty all over the
            island. For these, when they are hungry, will assault any man whatsoever and devour him,
            as it happened in this conjuncture to one of our companions. This man being gone into
            the wood in company with a negro, they fell into a place where a crocodile lay con-
            cealed. The furious animal with incredible agility assaulted the Pirate, and, fastening
            upon his leg, cast him upon the ground, the negro being fled who should assist him. Yet
            he, notwith- standing, being a robust and courageous man, drew forth a knife he had then
            about him, and with the same, after a dangerous combat, overcame and killed the
            crocodile. Which having done, he himself, both tired with the battle and weakened with
            the loss of blood that ran from his wounds, lay for dead upon the place, or at least
            beside his senses. Being found in this posture some while after by the negro, who
            returned to see what was become of his master, he took him upon his back and brought him
            to the sea-side, distant thence the space of a whole league. Here we received him into a
            canoe, and conveyed him on board our ship. After this misfortune none of our men dared
            be so bold as to enter the woods without good company. Yea, we our- selves, desirous to
            revenge the disaster of our companion, went in troops the next day to the woods, with
            design to find out crocodiles to kill. These animals would usually come every night to
            the sides of our ship and make resemblance of climbing up into the vessel. One of these,
            on a certain night, we seized with an iron hook, but he, instead of flying to the
            bottom, began to mount the ladder of the ship, till we killed him with other
            instruments. Thus, after we had remained there some considerable time and refitted
            ourselves with all things neces- sary, we set sail thence for Jamaica. Here we arrived
            within few days, after a prosperous voyage, and found Captain 240 RECALL OF GOVERNOR OF
            JAMAICA Morgan, who was got home before us, but had seen as yet none of his companions
            whom he left behind, we being the first that arrived there after him. The said Captain
            at that present was very busy, endeavour- ing to persuade and levy people to transport
            unto the isle of St Catharine, which he designed to fortify and hold as his own,
            thinking to make it a common refuge unto all sorts of Pirates, or at least of his own
            nation, as was said before. But he was soon hindered in the prosecution of this design
            by the arrival of a man-of-war from England. For this vessel brought orders from his
            Majesty of Great Britain, to recall the Governor of Jamaica from his charge over that
            island, unto the Court of England, there to give an account of his proceedings and
            behaviour in relation to the Pirates whom he had maintained in those parts, to the huge
            detriment of the subjects of the King of Spain. Unto this purpose the said man-of-war
            brought over also a new Governor of Jamaica, to supply the place of the preceding. This
            gentleman, being possessed of the govern- ment of the island, presently after gave
            notice unto all the ports thereof, by several boats which he sent forth to that intent,
            of the good and entire correspondence which his master the King of England designed
            henceforwards to maintain in those Western parts of the world towards his Catholic
            Majesty and all his subjects and dominions. And that unto this effect, for the time to
            come, he had received from his Sacred Majesty and Privy Council strict and severe orders
            not to permit any Pirate whatsoever to set forth from Jamaica, to commit any hostility
            or depredation upon the Spanish nation or dominions, or any other people of those
            neighbouring islands. No sooner these orders were sufficiently divulged but the Pirates,
            who as yet were abroad at sea, began to fear them, insomuch that they dared not return
            home unto the said island. Hereupon they kept the seas as long as they could, and
            continued to act as many hostilities as came in their way. Not long after, the same
            Pirates took and ransacked a con- siderable town, seated in the isle of Cuba, called La
            V ilia de los Cayos, of which we made mention in the description of the said island.
            Here they committed again all sorts of hos- tihty and inhuman and barbarous cruelties.
            But the new Governor of Jamaica behaved himself so constant to his duty, and the orders
            he had brought from England, that he appre- SOME ENGLISH PIRATES HANGED 241 hended
            several of the chief actors herein, and condemned them to be hanged, which was
            accordingly done. From this severity many others still remaining abroad took warning,
            and retired to the isle of Tortuga, lest they should fall into his hands. Here they
            joined in society with the French Pirates, inhabitants of the said island, in whose
            company they continue to this day. CHAPTER IX The relation of the shipwreck which
            Monsieur Bertram Ogeron, Governor of the isle of Tortuga, suffered near the Isles of
            Guadanillas. How both he and his companions fell into the hands of the Spaniards. By
            what arts he escaped their hands, and preserved his life. The enterprise which he
            undertook against Porto Rico to deliver his people. The unfortunate success of that
            design After the expedition of Panama above-mentioned, the inhabitants of the French
            islands in America, in the year 1673 (while the war was so fierce in Europe between
            France and Holland) , gathered a considerable fleet, for to go and possess themselves of
            the islands belonging to the States-General of the United Provinces in the West Indies.
            Unto this effect their admiral called together and levied all the Pirates and volunteers
            that would, by any inductions whatsoever, sit down under his colours. With the same
            design the Governor of Tortuga caused to be built in that island a good strong
            man-of-war, unto which vessel he gave the name of Ogeron. This ship he provided very
            well with all sorts of ammunition, and manned with five-hundred buccaneers, all resolute
            and courageous men, as being the vessel he de signed for his own safety. Their first
            intention was to go and take the isle of Curasao, belonging to the said States of
            Holland. But this design met with very ill success, by reason of a shipwreck, which
            impeded the course of their voyage. Monsieur Ogeron set sail from the port of Tortuga as
            soon as all things were in readiness, with intent to join the rest of the said fleet and
            pursue the enterprize aforementioned. Being arrived on the West side of the Island of St
            John de Puerto Rico, he was suddenly surprized with a violent storm. This increased to
            that a degree as caused his new frigate to 242 \ ^ BERTRAM OGERON WRECKED 243 strike
            against the rocks that neighbour upon the islands, called Guadanillas, where the vessel
            broke into a thousand pieces. Yet, being nigh unto the land of Porto Rico, all his men
            escaped, by saving their lives in boats, which they had at hand. The next day, all being
            now got on shore, they were dis- covered by the Spaniards who inhabit the island. These
            instantly took them to be French Pirates, whose intent was to take the said island anew,
            as they had done several times before. Hereupon they alarmed the whole country, and,
            gathering their forces together, marched out to their encounter. But they found them
            unprovided of all manner of arms, and consequently not able to make any defence, craving
            for mercy at their hands, and begging quarter for their lives, as the cus- tom is. Yet
            notwithstanding, the Spaniards, remembering the horrible and cruel actions those Pirates
            had many times committed against them, would have no compassion on their condition. But,
            answering them : Ha ! ye thievish dogs, here's no quarter for you ! they assaulted them
            with all fury imaginable, and killed the greatest part of the company. At last,
            perceiving they made no resistance nor had any arms to defend themselves, they began to
            relent in their cruelty, and stay their blows, taking prisoners as many as remained
            aUve. Yet still they would not be persuaded but that those unfortunate people were come
            thither with design to take again and ruin the island. Hereupon they bound them with
            cords, by two and two or three and three together, and drove them through the woods into
            the campaign, or open fields. Being come thus far with them, they asked them : What was
            become of their captain and leader? Unto these questions they constantly made answer :
            He was drowned in the shipwreck at sea ; although they knew full well it was false. For
            Monsieur Ogeron, being unknown unto the Spaniards, behaved himself among them as if he
            were a fool and had no common use of reason. Not- withstanding, the Spaniards, scarce
            believing what the prisoners had answered, used all the means they could possibly to
            find him, but could not compass their desires. For Mon- sieur Ogeron kept himself very
            close to all the features and mimical actions that might become any innocent fool. Upon
            this account he was not tied as the rest of his companions, 244 OGERON AND SURGEON
            ESCAPE but let loose, to serve the divertisement and laughter of the common soldiers.
            These now and then would give him scraps of bread and other victuals, whereas the rest
            of the prisoners had never sufficient wherewith to satisfy their hungry- stomachs. For,
            as to the allowance they had from the Spaniards, their enemies, it was scarce enough to
            preserve them alive. It happened there was found among the French Pirates a certain
            surgeon, who had done some remarkable services to the Spaniards. In consideration of
            these merits, he was unbound and set at liberty, to go freely up and down, even as
            Monsieur Ogeron did. Unto this surgeon Monsieur Ogeron, having a fit opportunity
            thereunto, declared his resolution of hazarding his life to attempt an escape from the
            cruelty and hard usage of those enemies. After mature deliberation, they both performed
            it, by flying unto the woods, with design there to make something or other that might be
            navigable, whereby to transport themselves elsewhere ; although unto this effect they
            had nor could obtain no other thing in the world that could be serviceable in building
            of vessels but one only hatchet. Thus they joined company, and began their march towards
            the woods that lay nearest the sea-coast. Having travelled all day long, they came about
            evening unto the sea-side almost unexpectedly. Here they found themselves without
            anything to eat, nor any secure place wherein to rest their wearied Hmbs. At last they
            perceived nigh the shore an huge quantity of fishes, called by the Spaniards corlabados.
            These frequently approach the sands of the shore in pursuit of other little fishes that
            serve them for their food. Of these they took as many as they thought necessary, and, by
            rubbing two sticks tediously together, they kindled fire, wherewith they made coals to
            roast them. The next day they began to cut down and prepare timber, wherewith to make a
            kind of small boat, in which they might pass over unto the isle of Santa Cruz, which
            belongs to the French. While they were busied about their work, they discovered, at a
            great distance, a certain canoe, which steered directly towards the place where they
            were. This occasioned in their minds some fears lest they should be found, and taken
            again by the Spaniards ; and hereupon they retired into the woods till such time as they
            could see thence and distinguish what THEY REACH SAMANA 245 people were in the canoe.
            But at last, as their good fortune would have it, they perceived them to be no more than
            two men, who in their disposition and apparel seemed to be fisher- men. Having made this
            discovery, they concluded unani- mously betwixt themselves to hazard their lives, and
            overcome them, and afterwards seize the canoe. Soon after they per- ceived one of them,
            who was a mulatto, to go with several calabashes hanging at his back towards a spring,
            not far distant from the shore, to take in fresh water. The other, who was a Spaniard,
            remained behind, waiting for his return. Seeing them divided, they assaulted the mulatto
            first, and discharging a great blow on his head with the hatchet, they soon bereaved him
            of hfe. The Spaniard, hearing the noise, made instantly towards the canoe, thinking to
            escape. But this he could not perform so soon, without being overtaken by the two, and
            there massacred by their hands. Having now compassed their design, they went to seek for
            the corpse of the mulatto, which they carried on board the canoe. Their intent was to
            convey them into the middle of the sea, and there cast them overboard, to be consumed by
            the fish, and by this means conceal this fact from being known unto the Spaniards,
            either at a short or long distance of time. These things being done, they took in
            presently as much fresh water as they could, and set sail to seek thence some place of
            refuge. That day they steered along the coast of Porto Rico, and came unto the cape
            called by the Spaniards Cabo Roxo. Hence they traversed directly to the isle of
            Hispaniola, where so many of their own comrades and com- panions were to be found. Both
            the currents of the waters and winds were very favourable unto this voyage, in so much
            that in a few days they arrived at a place called Samana, belonging to the said island,
            where they found a party of their own people. Monsieur Ogeron, being landed at Samana,
            gave orders unto the surgeon to levy all the people he could possibly in those parts,
            while he departed to revisit his government of Tortuga. Being arrived at the said port,
            he used all his endea- vours to gather what vessels and men he could to his assist- ance
            ; so that within a few days he compassed a good number of both, very well equipped and
            disposed to follow and execute his designs. These were to go unto the island of St John
            de 246 AMBUSHED BY THE SPANIARDS Puerto Rico, and deliver his fellow-prisoners whom he
            had left in the miserable condition as was said before. After having embarked all the
            people which the surgeon had levied at Samana, he made them a speech, exhorting them to
            have good courage, and telling them : You may all expect great spoil and riches from
            this enterprize, and therefore let all fear and cowardice he set on side. On the
            contrary, fill your hearts with courage and valour, for thus you will find yourselves
            soon satisfied of what, at present, hare hopes do promise. Every one relied much on
            these promises of Monsieur Ogeron, and, from his words, conceived no small joy in their
            minds. Thus they set sail from Tortuga, steering their course directly for the coasts of
            Porto Rico. Being come within sight of land, they made use only of their lower sails, to
            the intent they might not be discovered at so great a distance by the Spaniards, till
            they came somewhat near the place where they intended to land. The Spaniards,
            notwithstanding this caution, had intelli- gence beforehand of their coming, and were
            prepared for a defence, having posted many troops of horse all along the coast, to watch
            the descent of the French Pirates. Monsieur Ogeron, perceiving their vigilance, gave
            order to the vessels to draw nigh unto the shore and shoot off many great guns, whereby
            he forced the cavalry to retire unto places more secure within the woods. Here lay
            concealed many companies of foot, who had prostrated themselves upon the ground.
            Meanwhile the Pirates made their descent at leisure, and began to enter among the trees,
            scarce suspecting any harm to be there, where the horsemen could do no service. But no
            sooner were they fallen into this ambuscade than the Spaniards arose with great fury,
            and assaulted the French so courageously that in a short while they destroyed great part
            of them. And, thus leaving great numbers of dead on the place, the rest with difficulty
            escaped by retreating in all haste unto their ships. Monsieur Ogeron, although he
            escaped this danger, yet could willingly have perished in the fight rather than suffer
            the shame and confusion the unfortunate success of this enterprize was likely to bring
            upon his reputation, especially considering that those whom he had attempted to set at
            liberty were now cast into greater miseries through this mis- BRUTALITY TO FRENCH
            PRISONERS 247 fortune. Hereupon they hastened to set sail, and go back unto Tortuga the
            same way they came, with great confusion in their minds, much diminished in their
            number, and nothing laden with those spoils the hopes whereof had possessed their hearts
            and caused them readily to follow the promises of unfortunate Monsieur Ogeron. The
            Spaniards were very vigilant, and kept their posts nigh unto the sea-side till such time
            as the fleet of Pirates was totally out of sight. In the meanwhile they made an end of
            kiUing such of their enemies as being desperately wounded could not escape by flight. In
            like manner they cut off several limbs from the dead bodies, with design to show them to
            the former prisoners, for whose redemption these others had crossed the seas. . The
            fleet, being departed, the Spaniards kindled bonfires all over the island, and made
            great demonstrations of joy for the victory they had obtained. But the French prisoners
            who were there before had more hardship showed them from that day than ever. Of their
            misery and misusage was a good eye-witness, Jacob Binkes, Governor at that time in
            America for the States-General of the United Provinces. For he hap- pened to arrive in
            that conjuncture at the island of Porto Rico, with some men-of-war, to buy provisions
            and other necessaries for his fleet. His compassion on their misery was such as caused
            him to bring away by stealth five or six of the said prisoners, which served only to
            exasperate the minds of the Spaniards. For soon after they sent the rest of the
            prisoners to the chief city of the island, there to work and toil about the
            fortifications which then were making, forcing them to bring and carry stones and all
            sorts of materials belonging thereunto. These being finished, the Governor transported
            them unto Havana, where they employed them in like manner, in fortifying that city. Here
            they caused them to work in the day-time, and by night they shut them up as close
            prisoners, fearing lest they should enterprize upon the city. For of such attempts the
            Spaniards had had divers proofs on other occa- sions, which afforded them sufficient
            cause to use them after that manner. Afterwards at several times, wherein ships arrived
            there from New Spain, they transported them by degrees into Europe, and landed them at
            the city of Cadiz. But notwith- standing this care of the Spaniards to disperse them,
            they soon 248 LE SIEUR MAINTENON after met almost all together in France, and resolved
            among themselves to return again unto Tortuga with the first oppor- tunity [that] should
            proffer. To this effect, they assisted one another very lovingly with what necessaries
            they could spare, according to every one's condition ; so that in a short while the
            greatest part of those Pirates had nested themselves again at Tortuga, their common
            place of rendezvous. Here, some time after, they equipped again a new fleet, to revenge
            their former misfortunes on the Spaniards, under the conduct of one Le Sieur Maintenon,
            a Frenchman by nation. With this fleet he arrived at the island of Trinidad, situated
            between the isle of Tobago and the neighbouring coasts of Paria. This island they
            sacked, and afterwards put to the ransom of 10,000 pieces-of-eight. Hence they departed,
            with design to take and pillage the city of Caracas, seated over against the island of
            Curasao, belonging to the Hollanders. CHAPTER X A relation of what encounters lately
            happened at the islands of Cay ana and Tobago between the Count de Estres, Admiral of
            France, in America, and the Heer facob Binkes, Vice- Admiral of the United Provinces, in
            the same parts It is a thing already known unto the greatest part of Europe that the
            Prince of Courland began to estabUsh a colony in the island of Tobago ; as, also, that,
            somewhile after, his people, for want of timely recruits from their own country,
            abandoned the said island, leaving it to the first that should come and possess it. Thus
            it fell into the hands of the Heers Adrian and Cornelius Lampsius, natives of the city
            of Flushing, in the province of Zeeland. For, being arrived at the said island of
            Tobago, in the year 1654, they undertook to fortify it by command of their sovereigns,
            the States-General. Here- upon they built a goodly castle, in a convenient situation,
            capable of hindering the assaults of any enemies that might enterprize upon the island.
            The strength of this castle was afterwards sufficiently tried by Monsieur de Estres, as
            I shall presently relate, after I have first told you what happened before at Cayana in
            the year 1676. This year the States-General of the United Provinces sent their
            Vice-Admiral, Jacob Binkes, unto the island of Cayana, then in possession of the French,
            for to retake the said island, and hereby restore it unto the dominions of the United
            Pro- vinces aforementioned. With these orders he set forth from Holland on the i6th day
            of March in the said year, his fleet consisting of seven men-of-war, one fireship, and
            five other small vessels of less account. This fleet arrived at Cayana the 4th day of
            the month of May next following. Immediately after their arrival, the Heer Binkes landed
            nine-hundred men, who, approaching the castle, summoned the Governor to 349 ISO COUNT DE
            ESTRES' MISSION surrender at their discretion. His answer was : He thought of nothing
            less than surrendering, hut that he and his people were resolved to defend themselves,
            even to the utmost of their endeavours. The Heer Binkes, having received this answer,
            presently commanded his troops to attack the castle on both sides at once. The assault
            was very furious. But at length the French, being few in number and overwhelmed with the
            multitude of their enemies, surrendered both their arms and the castle. In it were found
            thirty-seven pieces of cannon. The Governor, who was named Monsieur Lesi, together with
            two priests were sent into Holland. The Heer Binkes lost in the combat 14 men only, and
            had 72 wounded. The King of France no sooner understood this success but he sent in the
            month of October following the Count de Estres, for to retake the said island again from
            the Hollanders. He arrived there in the month of December with a squadron of men-of-war,
            all very well equipped and provided. Being come on his voyage as far as the river called
            Aperovaco, he met there with a small vessel of Nantes, which had set forth from the said
            island of Cayana but a fortnight before. This ship gave him intelhgence of the present
            state and condition wherein he might be certain to find the Hollanders at Cayana. They
            told him there were 300 men in the castle ; that all about it they had fixed strong
            palisades, or empalements ; and that within the castle were mounted 26 pieces of cannon.
            Monsieur de Estres, being enabled with this intelligence to take his own measures,
            proceeded on his voyage, and arrived at a port of the said island 3 leagues distant from
            the castle. Here he landed 800 men, whom he divided into two several parties. The one he
            placed under the conduct of the Count de Blinac, and the other he gave unto Monsieur de
            St Faucher. On board the fleet he left Monsieur Cabaret, with divers other principal
            troops which he thought not fit or necessary to be landed. As soon as the men were set
            on shore, the fleet weighed anchor, and sailed very slowly towards the castle, while the
            soldiers marched by land. These could not travel otherwise than by night by reason of
            the excessive heat of the sun and intolerable exhalations of the earth, which here is
            very sulphurous, and consequently no better than a smoky and stinking oven. On the 19th
            day of the said month the Count de Estres ENGAGEMENT WITH DUTCH FLEET 251 sent Monsieur
            de Lesi (who had been Governor of the island, as was said before), demanding of them, to
            deUver the castle unto the obedience of the King, his master, and to him in his
            sovereign's name. But those who were within resolved not to deliver themselves up but at
            the expense of their lives and blood, which answer they sent unto Monsieur de Estres.
            Hereupon the French, the following night, assaulted and stormed the castle on seven
            several sides thereof all at once. The defendants, having performed their obligation
            very stoutly, and fought with as much valour as was possible, were at last forced to
            surrender. Within the castle were found 38 persons dead, besides many others that were
            wounded. All the prisoners were transported into France, where they were used with great
            hardship. Monsieur de Estres, having put all things in good order at the isle of Cayana,
            departed thence for that of Martinique. Being arrived at the said island, he was told
            that the Heer Binkes was at that present at the island of Tobago and his fleet lay at
            anchor in the bay. Having received this intelh- gence, Monsieur de Estres made no long
            stay there, but set sail again, steering his course directly for Tobago. No sooner was
            he come nigh unto the island but Vice-Admiral Binkes sent his land-forces, together with
            a good number of mariners, on shore, to manage and defend the artillery that was there.
            These forces were commanded by the Captains Van der Graef , Van Dongen and Ciavone, who
            laboured very hard all that night in raising certain batteries and filling up the
            palisades, or empalements, of the fortress called Sterreschans. Two days after, the
            French fleet came to an anchor in the Bay of Palmit, and immediately, with the help of
            eighteen boats, they landed all their men. The Heer Binkes, perceiving the French to
            appear upon the hills, gave orders to burn all the houses that were nigh unto the
            castle, to the intent the French might have no place to shelter themselves thereabouts.
            On the 23rd day of February Monsieur de Estres sent a drum over to the Hollanders to
            demand the surrender of the fort, which was absolutely denied. In this posture of
            affairs things con- tinued until the 3rd of March. On this day the French fleet came
            with full sail, and engaged the Dutch fleet. The Heer Binkes presently encountered them,
            and the dispute was very hot on both sides. In the meanwhile the land-forces belonging 2
            52 FRENCH ENTERPRIZE to the French, being sheltered by the thickness of the woods,
            advanced towards the castle, and began to storm it very briskly with more than ordinary
            force, but were repulsed by the Dutch with such vigour as caused them after three dis-
            tinct attacks to retire with the loss of. above 150 men, and 200 wounded. These they
            carried off, or rather dragged away, with no small difficulty, by reason of their
            disorderly retreat. All this while the two fleets continued the combat, and fought very
            desperately, until that on both sides some ships were consumed between Vulcan and
            Neptune. Of this number was Monsieur de Estres' own ship, mounted with 27 guns of
            prodigious bigness, besides other pieces of lesser port. The battle continued from break
            of day until the evening ; a little before which time Monsieur de Estres quitted the bay
            with the rest of his ships, unto the Hollanders, excepting only two, which were stranded
            under sail, as having gone too high within the port. Finally the victory remained on the
            side of the Hollanders, howbeit with the loss of several of their ships that were burnt.
            Monsieur de Estres, finding himself under the shame of the loss of this victory, and
            that he could expect no advantage for that present over the island of Tobago, set sail
            from those quarters the i8th day of March, and arrived the 21st day of June next
            following at the port of Brest in France. Having given an account of these transactions
            to his most Christian Majesty, he was pleased to command him to undertake again the
            enterprize of Tobago. Unto this effect, he gave orders for eight great men-of-war to be
            equipped with all speed, together with eight others of smaller account : with all which
            vessels he sent again Monsieur de Estres into America the same year. He set sail from
            the said port of Brest on the 3rd day of October following, and arrived the ist of
            December at the island of Barbados. Afterwards, having received some recruits from the
            isle of Martinique, he sent beforehand to review the island of Tobago, and consider the
            condition there- of. This being done, he weighed anchor and set sail directly for the
            said island, where he arrived the 7th day of the said month of December with all his
            fleet. Immediately after his arrival he landed 500 men, under the conduct of Monsieur de
            Blinac, Governor of the French islands in America. These were followed soon after by
            1000 more. FRENCH RETAKE TOBAGO 253 The 9th day of the said month they approached within
            600. paces of a certain post called Le Cort, where they landed all the artillery
            designed for this enterprize. On the loth day Monsieur de Estres went in person to take
            a view of the castle, and demanded of the Heer Binkes, by a messenger, the sur- render
            thereof, which was generously denied. The next day the French began to advance towards
            the castle, and on the 12th of the said month the Dutch from within began to fire at
            them with great perseverance. The French made a begin- ning to their attack by casting
            fire-balls into the castle with main violence. The very third ball that was cast in
            happened to fall in the path-way that led to the storehouse where the powder and
            ammunition was kept belonging to the castle. In this path was much powder scattered up
            and down, through the negligence of those that carried it to and fro for the neces- sary
            supplies of the defendants. By this means the powder took fire in the path, and thence
            ran in a moment as far as the storehouse above-mentioned ; so that suddenly both the
            storehouse was blown up, and with it Vice-Admiral Binkes himself, then Governor of the
            island, and all his officers. Only Captain Van Dongen remained alive. This mischance
            being perceived by the French, they instantly ran with 500 men, and possessed themselves
            of the castle. Here they found 300 men alive, whom they took prisoners and trans- ported
            into France. Monsieur de Estres after this com- manded the castle to be demolished,
            together with other posts that might serve for any defence, as also all the houses
            standing upon the island. This being done, he departed thence the 27th day of the said
            month of December, and arrived again in France after a prosperous voyage. CHAPTER XI
            Adventures of Captain Cook, in the year 1678. He is taken by the Spaniards. Bold
            exploits, and revenge of his losses, performed by some few Buccaneers that were on board
            his ship In the year 1678 Captain Cook, who followed the trade of the West Indies and
            our several plantations there, happened to go into the Bay of Campeche, there to load
            his vessel with logwood, as many others had done before. The forests about Campeche are
            a certain place adjoining to the Bay of Mexico, unto which for many years the Buccaneers
            have usually resorted to cut wood for the art of dyeing, and prepare hides for
            shoe-leather, and other uses, towards the lading of several ships that from all parts
            frequent the forementioned Bay, to trade with them. After he had taken in his lading,
            having also some of the Buccaneers aboard his vessel, he set sail for the island of
            Tobago, at which place he was to deliver his cargo ; but his fortune was to fall
            somewhat short, or leeward, in the phrase of the mariners, of his desired and intended
            port. Hereupon he came to anchor at the West end of a certain island called Rubia,
            whereof mention has been already made in the preceding history of the Buccaneers. Here
            Captain Cook had not lain long at anchor, expecting a wind for the prosecution of his
            voyage, when he was unex- pectedly surprized and taken by three Spanish men-of-war.
            These, having possessed themselves of his ship and cargo, presently after set both him
            and his companions ashore upon the aforesaid island. Here therefore being landed, they
            found a Dutch Governor or officer, with six men in his retinue, who were only settled
            there to purchase provisions for their vessels that should happen to touch in those
            parts. 254 CAPTAIN COOK 255 Our English had not been long on this island but there hap-
            pened to come into the road a Spanish boat, equipped with sixteen or eighteen men and
            laden with coconuts (whereof chocolate is made) and plate. The Buccaneers immediately
            put it into the thoughts of Captain Cook to make reprizal upon the countrymen of those
            who had so lately stripped them of all they had : he approving of their proposals, in
            order thereunto they acquainted the Governor's man with their intentions, and withal
            desired him, under promise of a good reward, to lend them a small number of fusees, or
            guns, where- with to put these their designs into execution. The Governor and his men,
            hearing the promise of so great a reward, were easily persuaded to accommodate them with
            arms at their request : six men, therefore, of the Buccaneers, being thus resolved and
            fitted with arms, placed themselves in ambuscade about that part of the island where the
            boat of the Spanish sloop was to come ashore. The boat happening to land there- abouts
            in a small time after, as they desired, they immediately set upon the men, and took them
            prisoners. Having bound them fast upon the strand, they seized the boat and embarked
            therein with resolution to take the vessel it belonged unto, which they performed in
            this manner : two of them they appointed among themselves to row the boat ; two more to
            charge their guns ; and the remaining couple were to fire into the Spanish bark as
            briskly as they could pour in their shot. In this posture they rowed in the wake, under
            the stern of the said vessel. The Spaniards on board soon perceived they were not to
            expect their own men again but enemies in lieu of them. Therewith immediately they put
            themselves into the posture of defence, and began to handle their arm$. But this they
            performed so unfortunately on their side, or rather fortunately for the English, that
            the Buccaneers killed the padre, or priest, they had on board, and the Captain or Master
            of the vessel Ukewise ; whereupon the rest surrendered themselves by throwing their arms
            overboard and craving quarter for their Uves. Thus at the same time they made themselves
            masters of the vessel and restitution of their former losses. Here, in the first place,
            they gave the Dutch Governor out of their gains a considerable present ; and his chief
            man they rewarded very liberally for the loan of the arms aforemen- 256 CAPTAIN COOK
            tioned. In the next, they assigned unto Captain Cook a valu- able consideration for his
            losses, and hkewise something unto each, and every one of the mariners that belonged to
            his ship. After which, the Buccaneers (for these were the chief, or rather only, men
            concerned in this attempt) divided among themselves nigh four-hundred pound to each,
            both in goods and plate. Thus they set sail from the isle of Rubia in the same Spanish
            bark they had taken, and arrived in few days after at Jamaica, where they took out her
            lading, and afterwards set fire unto the bottom, as being unfit for their purpose. Here
            they paid the Governor his duties, and embarked them- selves with their goods for
            England, where some of them live in good reputation unto this day. Yet their names are
            desired to be concealed in this place, this action resenting too much of self -justice,
            or petite piracy, which is a term they themselves have given unto it. CHAPTER XII ^A
            brief account of Captain Sharp and other his companions ; their voyage from Jamaica unto
            the province of Darien and South Sea ; with the robberies and assaults they committed
            therefor the space of three years, till their return for England in the year 1682. Given
            by one of the Buccaneers who was present at those transactions We set sail from Port
            Royal, upon the island of Jamaica, in the year of our Lord 1679. Our fleet consisted of
            five sail of ships, whereof the chief Commanders were named Captain Coxon, Cornelius
            Essex, Robert AUison, John Rose, and Captain Sharp. The first port we went unto was Port
            Moranto. Hence we steered our course directly for the coast of Cartagena, or rather for
            the islands of Pines, commonly called De los Pinos, not far distant from that coast. At
            these islands we victualled our ships, as at other times has been done by other men of
            the like trade. But in this passage from Port Moranto unto the Pine Islands we had the
            misfortune to lose, by stress of weather, two of our number of vessels, to wit Captain
            Sharp and CorneHus Essex, who both separated from us in a storm. However, having taken
            in what provision of victuals we thought necessary, we steered thence towards the island
            called Fuerte, or Porta. Being upon this course about the middle of the islands called
            Zavallos, or ZambuUos, we hap- pened to meet with a French man-of-war, who was mounted
            with eight guns, and who kept in our company for some days. His commission was but for a
            small space of time — only for three months. We shewed him our commission, which was now
            for three years to come. This we had purchased at a cheap rate, having given for it only
            the sum of ten ducats, or pieces-of-eight. But the truth of the thing was that at first
            our commission was made only for the space of three s 257 258 CAPTURE OF PORTO BELLO
            months, the same date as the Frenchman's was ; whereas among ourselves we had contrived
            to make it last for three years — for with this we were resolved to seek our fortunes.
            Having ranged for some while up and down the islands, which in those seas are pretty
            frequent, and finding nothing that could give us satisfaction, we at last resolved to
            attempt Porto Bello, which formerly had been taken and sacked by Sir Henry Morgan, and
            others, both English and French, hoping his fortune would favour our arms, and that we
            should bring away no less booty than he had done before. Unto this effect we thought it
            convenient to leave our ships at certain islands not far distant from Porto Bello, and
            put our men into fourteen or fifteen canoes, which we had taken for that purpose. With
            these we landed at a considerable distance from the town and port, and were constrained,
            after landing, to travel three whole nights before we could reach the place. By day we
            concealed ourselves in the woods and took our rest, for then we dared not to travel,
            fearing lest we should be discovered by the Spaniards, our mortal enemies, whom we
            intended to plunder : yet, notwithstanding, all the care we could possibly take, we were
            at last, before we came to the town, discovered by a negro, who ran before us unto the
            place and gave intelligence of our coming. Hereupon, per- ceiving we were descried, we
            hastened our march after his steps as fast as we could, and got into the town before he
            could raise the citizens or any considerable body of defence could be formed against us.
            Thus we possessed ourselves of the city without any considerable loss on our side, and
            plundered all we could find in the houses and elsewhere. Our stay here was but short,
            for fear lest the enemy should rally against us or pour in the country upon our small
            forces and thus intercept our retreat — especially as we had left our ships at the
            islands above-mentioned and were masters of only a few canoes to convey us over the seas
            unto them. Having been therefore in possession of the town the space of two days and two
            nights, we resolved to quit it and return unto our ships. We divided amongst us, out of
            the booty, about forty pound sterling to each man, beside what extraordinary shares were
            drawn by our officers, the owners of the vessels, carpen- ters, surgeons, and those who
            lost any limbs, or were killed in this expedition, according to the customary laws of
            the CAPTURE OF A PACKET-BOAT 259 Buccaneers, which are described in the History of these
            people but lately printed. In this exploit of taking the town of Porto Bello our number
            was not above that of 200 men, the residue being left behind to man and defend our
            ships. Yet, notwith- standing, these who guarded the ships had their shares equally
            distributed unto them, as well as those who went on shore. In all our whole number might
            consist of 300 fighting-men, which we brought out from Jamaica with us — not many more,
            if I well remember : which point I forgot to tell you at the beginning of this relation.
            Being returned on board our ships, we cruized to and fro for some days, hoping to find
            some other purchase by sea, as we had done by land. But nothing could we meet withal
            that would stay our thirst and hunger after more prey : only, being upon a certain tack,
            we happened to meet with a Span- ish barco de avifo, or packet-boat, which was called St
            Rose, mounted only with six guns, and which was bound for Spain, or from there to the
            West Indies, with letters and intelligence concerning the galleons, or floia, and other
            State affairs, as they are usually sent every year by the CathoUc King unto his
            Viceroys, or Governors, in those parts, or else by them unto His Majesty, upon the
            aforesaid account. This little ship, therefore, we immediately set upon and took, but
            found not so much in her as would answer our expectations. Neither the letters they had
            on board could we reach, from which we might possibly have learned something which would
            have pleased our fancies or flattered our hopes for some while ; for the Spaniards cast
            them into the sea, when they saw them- selves in danger of being taken, before we could
            possess our- selves of the vessel ; which was done according to the strict and almost
            inviolable orders the Captains of these packet boats, or navios de avifo (for so they
            are also named), that is packet-ships, do constantly receive from the King of Spain ;
            unto which effect also they take an oath, viz. to cast their letters overboard, and not
            deliver them up to any enemy whatsoever. Conformable to this point, all the Captains of
            the galleons belonging likewise are solemnly sworn to sink, burn, or otherwise to
            destroy their ships rather than permit them to be taken by an enemy, for fear of
            enriching him not so much with those their great vessels as with the treasure they bring
            home. 26o LANDING IN DARIEN After taking the packet-boat before-mentioned, perceiving
            our vessels to be foul, we steered our course for Boca del Toro, there to careen our
            ships. This place is already mentioned in the History of the Buccaneers, and is often
            frequented by Pirates for the same purpose. Here we met with Captain Peter Harris, in a
            Dutch ship of thirty-two guns, and also with Captain Richard Sawkins, who was in a small
            brigantine mounted with only four guns. Both these ships had put in there either to
            careen or refresh themselves with water and other provisions. Having cleansed and
            careened our bottoms to our satisfac- tion, we afterwards cruized again for some while,
            in hopes of finding some such purchase as we most desired. But, being frus- trated of
            our expectations, at last we resolved to quit again our ships and land on the coast of
            Darien, thinking there to find what we so long had sought for — or at least [to] plunder
            and pillage some towns belonging to that coast. This resolu- tion therefore we presently
            put in execution; and, standing over towards the land of Darien, we soon after went on
            shore there, and began to range up and down the woods, designing to take some prisoners
            who might serve us with intelligence and be our guides, as being totally ignorant of the
            country. Here we found an Indian that could speak Spanish, whom therefore we examined
            very strictly, where the gold and silver of that country did lie ; for we had heard that
            both these coveted metals were digged out or found in some parts of that province by the
            Spaniards. He told us that not far distant from there there was a place called Tocamora
            (for so it was named), which was the receptacle-town of all the gold that was found in
            those parts, saying often unto us in the Spanish language, and repeating these words,
            miicho oro ay en Tocamora, that is a great deal of gold lieth at Tocamora, and that he
            would guide us unto it. With these promises we were infinitely encouraged, and resolved
            not to return unto our ships until such time as we had made some considerable booty, at
            least sufficient for one voyage, to satisfy our earnest appetite for gold. We landed in
            Darien, according to what I can best remember, either about the latter end of March or
            the begin- ning of April, in the year 1680, when began the chiefest and hardest of our
            adventures both by land and sea — those I have rehearsed being only the preludiums of
            such as were to follow. COMPACT WITH INDIANS 261 By the way, as we marched towards
            Tocamora under the conduct of our Indian, we took other prisoners, and learned from them
            other things. That the Indians of that country hated mortally the Spaniards and were at
            enmity with them : that they had a chief Captain, or leader, whom they styled Emperor,
            and who would be glad of our assistance against the Spaniards, by whom he had been much
            wronged, and was therefore with them in open and continual war. That, in recompense of
            our service, he would certainly lead us unto those places where most gold and silver was
            to be had, these being unjustly detailed from him, and where it was but fighting for it,
            and having more than we should be able to carry away. These allurements put our minds
            upon new designs, and were sufficient to entice us to present our auxiliary service unto
            the Emperor of that country, as judging it more convenient to be put in possession, or
            rather led unto those so vastly rich places, by the Emperor and the Indians themselves
            than to have both Indians and Spaniards all at once against us ; especially in a foreign
            country where we knew not one step of the way. Thus, after an intercourse of some few
            messengers who were sent to and fro, we came at last (not to be too tedious in the
            narrative) unto a view and amicable parley with the Emperor himself in person, who
            readily accepted of our ser- vice and promised himself great matters from our aid and
            assistance against the Spaniards. He failed not to promise us great heaps of gold, would
            we but fight courageously under his conduct, and regain those places from the Spaniards
            where they were most certainly to be found. These things we easily believed as feasible,
            and therefore as readily did embrace his propositions ; yet, should we fail of our
            designs, we had still other things under consideration, which might in great probability
            be as profitable and turn to the same account. The sum of these was to descend by the
            river of Darien, or any other, into the South Sea, and there to rove up and down until
            such time as we could meet any rich prize, or galleon coming from Lima to Panama, or
            else to plunder again either the city of Panama or any other of so many rich towns and
            villages are known to border upon the coasts of that sea. As for shipping, though we had
            it not at present, yet we feared not to obtain it by the help of those canoes we should
            employ 262 SERVICE WITH INDIANS to carry us down the river. After which, we considered
            it would be no great difficulty to return homewards, either round about the Strait of
            Magellan, which navigation, though diffi- cult, had been performed by others, or through
            the same country of Darien, where we were at present. Thus we engaged, about the number
            of 300 men, in the service of this Indian Emperor, whom we took for our leader, in
            company of many others of his own subjects, who were to back our designs, as we intended
            to lead the van of most attempts. The name of this Emperor aforementioned was Andraeas,
            from which we guessed that some footsteps of Christianity had been planted in his
            country by the Spaniards, and that either he or his ancestors had been by them baptized,
            though at present they seemed to regard but little what belonged unto Christian
            religion. He had also a son, whose name was Augustin, and unto whom we made bold, among
            ourselves, to give the name of King Golden-Cap, from a certain cap, or hat, of pure and
            massive gold which he had then upon his head when first we saw him. The first enterprize
            which the said Emperor propounded unto us was to take the town of Santa Maria, situated
            pretty near unto the Southern Sea and at the distance of several days journey from the
            place where these things were agreed upon. This town, as it was said, had been taken
            from the Emperor by the covetous Spaniard, and was reported to be hugely rich in dust of
            gold, which there was gathered in great quantity out of the river that runs through the
            country. Here was a fort and a town pretty well garrisoned, as having between both about
            400 Spaniards for their defence and to guard the treasure which there was lodged of
            gold-dust, as has been said. We marched, therefore, in company of the Emperor Andraeas
            (who always went before us, and encouraged our men wherever they fought) the space of
            three days journey, to meet his son King Golden-Cap at his own habitation, or palace,
            lying in our way, he being to join with us in this expedition. He entertained us very
            nobly at this palace for a day or two, and sent us also presents of victuals to meet us
            by the way, having heard of our coming. Thence we de- parted with our entire little
            camp, the Emperor, and his son, in quest of the town of Santa Maria, as yet distant from
            there no less than four or five days journey. After several fatigues THEY CAPTURE SANTA
            MARIA 263 sustained by the way, together with the loss of some of our canoes by the
            downfalls of the rivers, and trees likewise which the Spaniards had cast therein to
            hinder our passage, we arrived by. night within two or three miles of Santa Maria, and
            there reposed ourselves in the woods until the next morning. Day being come, we marched
            towards the town, and gave the assault unto the place and fort : both which we carried,
            or possessed ourselves of, with no great difficulty and an incon- siderable loss on our
            side, consisting only of three men, though several others were wounded. Of the Spaniards
            we killed and wounded above 100. The fort was encompassed with palisades, called also by
            the Spaniards estacadas or huge strong and thick pales of wood. Having taken the fort
            and town, and examined our prisoners very severely concern- ing the treasure we there
            expected to find, all that we got out of them was very inconsiderable, in view of the
            huge expectations we had conceived in our minds. For the Spani- ards, having timely
            notice of our march, had conveyed away unto remoter places, towards Panama, some few
            days before, all that was valuable upon the place ; so that our disappoint- ment here in
            this particular was very great, and all that ever we could rob and pillage, either in
            the town or fort, scarce amounted unto twenty pound weight of gold and some small
            quantity of silver. Our stay here at Santa Maria was but short, not above the space of
            two days, our resolutions being to seek revenge for the huge loss, or rather
            disappointment, we had sustained of our vast expectations. We had here intelligence
            given us of some mine or mines of gold that were somewhere to be found farther on about
            this place, called St Maries River, but whether it might prove to be worth our time and
            labour to go seek them (especially considering we knew how not to come at the gold when
            we should find them out, and that the Spaniards and miners, or slaves, would be all
            fled, transporting with them what was already digged out) we could not easily determine.
            Hereupon we all unanimously agreed to visit the South Sea, unto which we were already
            very near, in those canoes we had brought with us, which were sufficient for our number,
            con- cluding either to attack Panama and ransack it anew, as Sir Henry Morgan had done
            before us, or at least that we 2 64 THEY ENTER THE SOUTH SEA should meet with some
            considerable prize in that Sea where ships do navigate so quietly and but few pirates
            were ever seen. Thus, having taken in what provisions we thought necessary, we fell down
            the river in our canoes, taking the opportunity of the tide, and arrived the next day at
            the mouth of the river in sight of the South Sea. Here we were all in danger of being
            lost with our canoes, the wind blowing extremely hard and causing a violent storm, which
            overwhelmed one of our canoes with seven or eight men, who had all inevit- ably perished
            had they not been taken up with the utmost extremity of danger of others who ventured
            their lives to save them. This river we went down into the South Sea I think was called
            Darien, though I cannot be very positive herein. Being now come into the Pacific, or
            South Sea, we sailed, or rowed, along the shore towards Panama, which is not far distant
            from the mouth of the river, where we disem- bogued^, touching at several places or
            little islands in our way to take in water or search for provisions for our fleet of
            canoes. All this while we had in our company the Emperor and his son Golden-Cap,
            together with the Indians they brought into the field, so that we were a pretty
            considerable fleet of fisher-boats or canoes : each canoe had six, eight, or ten men on
            board, yea some had fourteen and more. At Plantin Isle, which isle lies between the
            mouth of the river we came out at and Panama, we seized a Spanish bark, which had a
            considerable number of men on board her, I believe above lOO, but nothing else that was
            worth our acceptance. This vessel we took in hopes of a good prize, and withal to mend
            ourselves in shipping, for this was now the biggest bottom we had. By this time those of
            Panama had received advice of our adventures at Santa Maria, as also of our coming into
            the South Sea either in quest of that city or of some other hazard- ous attempt. They
            were, therefore, infinitely alarmed at these news, and in great haste had thrust out to
            sea three or four small vessels or barks, though withal pretty well manned, which they
            called La Armadilla, or The Little Fleet, out of design to guard their coasts and oppose
            our attempts. Thus the very next day we came into the South Sea one of these barks
            belonging to the Armadilla came up with us, ' Sec note 2 on p. 309. DESTRUCTION OF THE
            ARMADILLA 26s and very briskly fired at our fleet, as if they would fight us all ; but
            soon tacked about and bid us adieu, having killed [of] us one man and wounded six or
            seven more. Two days after we met with three more of these barks belonging to the
            Armadilla of Panama, whereof the one had on board, as well as I can remember, 90 men ;
            another had fourscore ; and the third threescore and five. These small men-of-war met
            with us at a great disadvantage, for that morning we had sent away the Spanish bark
            which we had taken at Plantin Isle, to seek for fresh water at some places, we having
            been disappointed of it where we had sought for it before ; and, to the intent she might
            go the safer and peradventure bring us some good purchase by the way, we had put on
            board her above 100 of our best men : so that what bottoms we had left were only canoes,
            and in them not above 200 good fighting- men, for of the Indians we made no great
            account, as wanting both our arms and experience to manage them. The Arma- dilla came up
            with full sail unto us, and engaged us very stoutly, thinking to take or destroy every
            canoe in our fleet ; but we, knowing scarce any quarter could be expected at their hands
            especially in those seas, were resolved never to surrender, and do the utmost of our
            endeavour to destroy them or make them fly. Thus, after the first volleys of shot, we
            presently encompassed one of these little men-of-war with our canoes, and as desperately
            ran him aboard with sword and pistol in hand, causing him suddenly to surrender. Being
            in posses- sion of him, we took another of their small number, and forced the third to
            fly away towards the town of Panama with all the sail he could make : this rencounter,
            or engagement, though but short, yet was very bloody — especially on the Spaniards' side
            — and sharp ; for in it we had a dozen of our men killed outright, and almost forty who
            were desperately wounded. How many the Spaniards lost or had wounded among them we could
            not learn — especially in the third vessel, which fought us all along very briskly and
            stood close to it for a good while even after the other two were taken ; so that we
            could not do otherwise than commend the courage of those Spaniards. The Armadilla being
            destroyed, we proceeded to the road of Panama, which we instantly blocked up with our
            canoes and other vessels, which now were three or four. Here in iGG BEFORE PANAMA the
            harbour, and at the mouth thereof, we took five or six vessels more, or rather ships,
            between great and small — but no great booty in them : amongst these only was one,
            called La Trinidad, or The Blessed Trinity, which was a ship of four-hundred tons and in
            which we found about threescore- thousand pieces-of-eight, that were sent to pay the
            garrison of the town or for some other effect. In this ship, being a good, strong and
            tight vessel, we came afterwards for England. The dividend of this prize amounted unto
            above 240 pieces- of-eight to each man ; yet had we good fortune in not being
            disappointed of this purchase, as we had been oftentimes before in other adventures ;
            for though we had blocked up the mouth of the road, and lay, as I have said, before
            Panama, yet this ship gave us the sHp, and got into the har- bour in the dark of the
            night both unseen and unknown to us. However, we having intelligence thereof, entered
            the harbour when they thought themselves in safety, and had the good luck to seize and
            make a prize of her, though not without some small loss of men. Both in this and other
            skir- mishes we lost in all before Panama 40 men, and had about 50 more wounded ; so
            that now our small number was almost, if not quite, reduced unto two-third parts
            thereof. The wounded we all put into one vessel, which we appointed to be the hospital
            of our fleet, and the other vessels we manned as well as our number would afford to do
            it. After having stayed some days before Panama and blocked up the road, we weighed
            anchor, and went unto a little island named Tobago, there to provide ourselves with
            several necessaries, which were at that instant something scarce with us. As for the
            town of Panama itself, we dared not to attempt it with so small a number of men, they
            being well provided to give us a hot reception : only once we landed 150 men, which were
            as many as we could well spare from manning and defending our fleet of canoes and ships
            ; but found we could do no good against the town, being repulsed with some damage, which
            notwithstanding we made a good retreat unto our fleet. Being almost ready to raise the
            blockade of Panama, Captain John Coxon (or Croxen) began to vary in his resolu- tions,
            and at last openly to mutiny against the rest of the Company : the effect hereof was
            that he departed from us and returned back with the Emperor and his son King Golden-
            DEPARTURE OF COXON 267 Cap and all the Indians and canoes they had brought with them,
            carrying also with him 50 of our English company and the best surgeon of the fleet, who
            belonged unto him and who would not go without his instruments to work withal, that is
            to say the medicaments, which we very much wanted for our wounded men. What medicines he
            left behind were not con- siderable in comparison of what he carried away ; but this
            point we knew not till afterwards, or we should have torn in pieces the said surgeon and
            his master rather than have parted with those things of which we had so much necessity.
            This piece of dishonesty of Captain Coxon weakened much our forces and diminished in
            great measure our number ; for, had he taken care of or carried away our wounded men, we
            should not much have resented his departure, the Indians being of no considerable help
            unto us. But here, that he may be known, I will not omit to tell you that the chief
            occasion of his grudge against us was because we reproached him for his ill-behaviour in
            the engagement we had with the Armadilla of Panama ; for in that dangerous action, to
            speak it all in a word, he shewed himself more like a coward than one of our profession,
            that is to say a true Buccaneer. What adventures he and his com- pany met withal after
            they separated from us I cannot give any just account thereof ; only that as we learned
            afterwards he went back unto the mouth of the river, and over land much by the same way
            he had come before, till he came to the North Sea (where doubtless he found the ships we
            had left behind us), being civilly entertained all along by those Indians and the good
            Emperor Andraeas and his son, though he had done them no great service — which sheweth
            the civility of those Indians, and what inclinations they had for us English rather than
            the Spaniards, their ancient masters. Thus we dis- engaged from the pretended service we
            had proffered unto that Emperor — I call it pretended, forasmuch as any one would easily
            guess that the real intent thereof was only to serve ourselves with gold and silver, and
            learn intelligence from those Indians where it was to be had, or, what is more obvious,
            to be led by them unto it — especially considering that, had we gone any other way about
            this matter, it might have cost us every one of our lives ; for these Indians of Darien
            are very fierce withal, and are the same people that killed and tore in pieces that
            famous Buccaneer L'OUonais 268 CAPTAIN SAWKINS KILLED (of whom you may read many notable
            exploits in the History of the Buccaneers) and many other of his companions, for landing
            upon and offering violence to their country and habitations. But our constant
            resolutions were, not to go back nor return homewards until such time as we had made a
            diligent search into those Southern Seas, and freighted, if possible, our vessels with
            gold, or at least as much silver as they could carry : such vast expectations had we
            framed now unto ourselves, in the vain ideas of our minds. Captain Coxon, who commanded
            in chief, being separated or departed from us, we chose in his place Captain Sawkins and
            Captain Sharp to lead us, and were now reduced unto 200 men, whereof many, as was said
            before, lay dangerously wounded in the hospital-vessel. Having, therefore, refitted
            ourselves at the island of Tobago, which is situated over-against the road of Panama, we
            sailed thence about the middle of May, 1680, in quest of some other purchase or design,
            coasting the shore towards the Northern parts of America commonly called California. We
            persisted in our course the space of eight or ten days, in all which time nothing
            remarkable happened unto us ; till at the end thereof we arrived at the isles of Quiblo,
            where there is a town called by the Spaniards Puebla Nueva. Here we landed to seek
            provisions, and by the by to plunder what we could get ; but, the country being alarmed
            since our blocking up the road of Panama, they had put themselves into an indifferent
            good posture of defence, and hereupon watched for our coming, and were resolved to
            entertain us as warmly as they could. Captain Sawkins therefore, landing before the
            rest, as being a man of undaunted courage, and running up with a small party to some
            breast-works they had made before the town, was here unfortunately killed, more through
            his own temerity and the rashness of his conduct than any other cause. Those who
            followed could not possibly rescue him, as being not yet quite landed : besides him, two
            or three more were killed and five or six wounded, which caused the residue of those he
            had led up to retreat unto the waterside as fast as they could. Thus we were beaten off
            from the place, and got nothing but blows for our pains. But this disaster occasioned a
            second mutiny amongst our men : our Commanders were not thought to be leaders fit SHARP
            MADE COMMANDER 269 enough for such great and hard enterprizes. Now Captain Sharp was
            left in chief, and he was censured by many. The contest grew so hot and came to that
            degree that we divided again into parties, and about threescore-and-ten more of our men
            fell off from us, separated, and returned back overland, as Coxon and the others had
            done before. Others who com- manded vessels threw up their commissions (I can only name
            unto you Captain Cook for one), in whose room others were placed to command their ships.
            Thus all things were in great distraction, and our company decreased daily ; yet others
            held constant to their resolutions, and were still determined to be buried in those seas
            rather than to return home without the gold they had fought for so long and through so
            many dangers. At the mouth of the river belonging to this place we surprised a bark, or
            great boat, which was laden with maize, or Indian wheat, which stood us in very good
            stead at that present ; for provisions now again began to grow somewhat scarce with us.
            Our Commander now was Captain Sharp, and our number was only of 130, or not quite 140.
            We sailed from Puebla Nueva, and steered our course for the islands called De los
            Galapagos, or in English Tortoise Islands, from the huge number of tortoises which there
            are to be found. These islands, which are seven or eight, all compre- hended under the
            same name, lie very close unto, if not under, the equinoctial line : there we intended
            to careen our vessels and seek more provisions ; but, the winds proving contrary for a
            long while, we could not reach them, and were con- strained to take up for the same
            purpose with another little island called Gorgona, where indifferent good accommodation
            was found for refitting our ships. Here we careened and got in provisions, staying here
            for these two intents above a month, so that it was towards the latter end of July
            before we departed thence. Three or four days after we set out from Gorgona we lost
            Captain Sharp in the dark of the night, and with him the best vessel we had, which was
            the Trinity, the same ship which we had taken out of the harbour of Panama. This loss
            occa- sioned sundry distractions in our minds, not knowing what would become of us after
            so many misfortunes : he was gone from us a whole fortnight or thereabouts ; neither had
            we any hopes of finding him any more, till at last, we happening to put in at Drake's
            Isle to seek for provisions, he happily arrived 270 DRAKE'S ISLAND ; GUAYAQUIL there
            three days after, which caused in us infinite joy, he having the best vessel and
            stoutest men on board : yes, we had missed of him this time Ukewise, and perhaps for
            ever, had we not, by a misfortune of sinking our canoe, which was sent ashore, tarried
            there one day longer than we determined. Having sailed from Drake's Isle, we arrived in
            seven or eight days after over against Guayaquil. Hereabouts, by night, we took a little
            Spanish man-of-war, like unto the vessel of the Armadilla of Panama ; who was come out
            from Guaya- quil, and in a true blue Spanish bravado had undertaken to take or destroy
            us with that little tool and only 30 or 40 men. The Captain's name was Don Thomas de
            Argandona, of which name and family, as I am credibly informed, there have been several
            sea-commanders in this age who were both skilful and courageous men. The vessel we
            thought fit to sink, as being of no use unto us and wanting men to man her. In the fight
            we lost none of our men, and only three were wounded ; what the Spaniards lost I do not
            remember. The prisoners told us that some of our men who had deserted us at Puebla Nueva
            had landed in a bark not far from Guayaquil, and that all of them were killed by the
            inhabitants of an island where they landed, excepting one : what became of the rest, I
            have not yet learned. This was the occasion of fitting out this bark against us, little
            thinking perhaps that we had a ship of four- hundred ton under us, and only being
            persuaded they should meet with some such little bark or canoe as that was, whose men
            their neighbours had destroyed a little before. About a week or ten days after, we took
            another prize more valuable than the former : this was a ship of three-hundred ton
            called St Peter, and was loaden with coco-nuts, broad- cloth, timber, and other goods,
            and was bound for Lima, which is the capital city of Peru. We took out of her what we
            most wanted, or thought fit for our designs, and, having cut down the main mast, let her
            go with all the prisoners we had, and most of the provisions that was on board her. This
            was about the beginning of September, 1680, as my notes tell me. Towards the latter end
            of October we descried the land of Arica, having sustained beforehand for many days
            infinite hunger and thirst. For provisions at length grew so scarce with us that we were
            allowed only five ounces of meal, and one pint of water to each man, the Captain himself
            having no THEY SEIZE COQUIMBO 271 more allowance than the rest : yea, at last, some were
            found among us who gave 30 pieces-of-eight for a pint of water, and very glad they were
            to get it, so near starving we were when we came to Arica. Here we could land no men,
            the sea was so big, which made us go to a port close by called He lo he. At this port we
            landed, and found some provisions, especially at a sugar-works not far distant thence.
            Here we refreshed, and feasted ourselves pretty well for three or four days. The
            Spaniards came unto us with a flag of truce, and promised to bring us in good store of
            beeves and hogs, as many as we de- manded, provided we would spare their ingenio de
            azucar, or sugar- works, and not pull it down ; which we promised to do. But, two days
            after, these treacherous Spaniards sent 300 horsemen against us, instead of bringing the
            cattle, with full intent to destroy us if possibly they could. We drew out our men into
            a plain, and at the first volley killed several of them, which made them wheel about and
            instantly retire, though at first they came very fiercely against us. With this we re-
            tired to our vessels, knowing no more good was to be done there at that time, nor at
            Arica ; for by this body of horse we perceived all the country was alarmed against us.
            From He lo he that day month we arrived at Coquimbo, upon which place we resolved to
            revenge our former affronts at Arica. Here we met with a body of 150 horse just at our
            landing, which always watch the bay ; who instantly set upon us with great fury, and
            made a circle about the first party of our men that were landed, thinking to make sure
            of our de- struction and cut us all in pieces. But we stood to our arms very
            courageously, killed and wounded several of them, and routed them soon, having only one
            man wounded on our side. We followed them close at their heels into the town, which we
            instantly took with no loss at all. This action was per- formed with only four-score
            men, a few more or less, and the first party that fought the horse were under 40. When
            we came into the town, we found it was of a considerable bigness, and had no less than
            eight or nine churches, which made us fear there were more inhabitants than we could
            master, as being so few in number that it were impossible to fight our way through them,
            should they come to a head and make any resistance. As therefore we met the inhabitants,
            we told them they must repair to the church or churches, or else expect no 272 COQUIMBO
            SACKED quarter from them that were following us who were many hundreds in number ; for
            we were only the forerunners of a greater body of Pirates that were at our heels. Having
            so done, and got several churches full of the inhabitants, we placed at each door a
            barrel of gunpowder with a train to it and a man standing with a lighted match, who told
            them that, if they offered to stir out, he would presently give fire ; but none offered
            to attempt it. So that by this means, while the inhabitants remained in that
            confinement, we plundered the town at our leisure. Here we found great store of
            provisions of all sorts ; for the town is very pleasant and finely adorned with orchards
            of fruit, vineyards, and gardens. At Coquimbo is also gold-dust to be found in a river
            that runneth close by the place. Here another piece of treachery was put upon us by the
            Governor of the town. After a flag of truce and some complements sent to and fro between
            us, he came to an amicable parley with our Captain and only two more, one on each side,
            where they drank very friendly together upon a hill close by the town, he keeping the
            fields with his horsemen and all those that were fled out of the town. There he pro-
            mised to ransom the town from fire, for 95,000 pieces-of-eight, which should be sent us
            in within a day or two. But that night or the next they contrived to fire our ship, an
            Indian swimming aboard under the stern with a ball of combustible matter, which he fixed
            there unseen to our men ; so that, had it not been discovered by the stink before it
            burst out into a flame, we had all, both on shore and land, inevitably perished. The
            next day they half-drowned the town by letting in many sluices of water upon us ; by
            which acts of hostility and treachery we perceived no faith nor money more than what we
            had already got was to be expected from them. Thus we set fire to the town, staying as
            long as we could till it was all in a flame, locked up the doors of the churches, and
            marched out, fighting our way down to our boats, which we easily did, for they made no
            great opposition after the first volleys of our shot, which killed some few of them.
            Here we set Captain Argandona on shore. Captain Peralta, who was taken in the ship that
            was bound for Lima, and other prisoners which we had still remaining on board our
            vessel, and whom we all along entertained very well. We were in possession of the town
            of Coquimbo only four or five days, and for our booty we brought WATLING MADE COMMANDER
            273 away five-hundred pound weight of plate, besides jewels, goods, and other things.
            From Coquimbo we sailed to the isles of Juan Fernandez, where we kept our Christmas that
            year 1680, finding there good plenty of provisions, and as much dissention among our men
            — who would not return home that year, as our Captain would have them to do, but make a
            farther search for gold, or golden prizes, into those seas. But the true occasion of
            their grudge was that Captain Sharp had got by these adven- tures, as it was said,
            almost a-thousand pound, whereas many of our men were scarce worth a groat : and good
            reason there was for their poverty, for at the Isle of Plata, called by us Drake's Isle,
            and other places, they had lost all their money to their fellow Buccaneers at dice — so
            that some had a great deal, and others just nothing. Those who were thrifty men sided
            with Captain Sharp, and were for returning home ; but the others chose another
            Commander, by name John Watling, and turned Sharp out of his commission, pretending they
            could do it as being a free election. And so they might do, for they were the greatest
            number by far ; and power may pretend to any thing. This contest had like to have come
            to blows among us ; but some prudent men moderated the matter, and per- suaded Captain
            Sharp's party to have patience for a while — at least seeing they were the fewest, and
            had moneys to lose, which the other party had not. By order of our new Commander Watling
            we set sail pre- sently after the beginning of the New Year 1681 from the isles of Juan
            Fernandez, and were resolved to go and plunder Arica, both to find employment for our
            discontented party, as being a vastly rich place, and to remember them for the shams put
            upon us at He lo he or Ylo. Just as we were ready to sail, three men-of-war came upon
            us, one of eight, another of twelve, and the third of sixteen guns. We had not so much
            as one gun, for all our vessel was of four-hundred ton or more. Neither had we now more
            than one ship, we having sunk the Mayflower, wherein Captain Cox sailed, upon the coast
            of Guayaquil, by reason we had broken her bowsprit with the stern of the Trinity, which
            had her in a tow, and could not fit her with another. These ships now being three
            against one, and we not able to divide them, as we endeavoured to do, by running on
            board their Admiral before the rest could come up. 274 REPULSE AT ARICA we thought fit
            to run for it. So we did, bidding them adieu in the night, and steering directly, as I
            have mentioned, for Arica. We landed at Arica, and fought the town with 93 men, which
            number was all we could conveniently spare. We got into the town and took several of
            their breast-works, yet were repulsed from the castle, and afterwards beaten out of the
            town by the country-people, who poured in upon us in huge numbers ; so that we were
            forced to retreat unto our boats, fighting our way through above 1000 men who were
            gathered against us : this was the hardest shock we had in all the South Sea. Captain
            Watling, our Commander-in-chief, was here killed ; through whose ill-conduct, as it was
            thought, this mis- fortune happened unto us. For, had he assaulted the fort in time,
            before the people and soldiers that ran out of the town were got into it, we had
            undoubtedly carried all before us. But he trifled away his time in giving quarter and
            taking prisoners upon the breastworks, till at last we had more prisoners than we could
            command. We placed some of these prisoners before the front of our men, when we
            assaulted the castle, just as Sir Henry Morgan did the nuns and friars at Porto Bello ;
            but the Spaniards fired as well at them as at us. In a word, we lost here 40 men, nine
            of which were taken prisoners, being our surgeons and others, while they were dressing
            the wounded at the hospital ; which loss of our surgeons increased our damage very much,
            and only 42 or 43 were left serviceable to fight our way through so many hundred of foot
            and horse unto our boats, we not losing one man by the way, though several were wounded
            : so much did we awe them with our fuzees, and so afraid were they to break in upon us,
            though we were almost three miles from our boats. This repulse we resented more than any
            other we ever sustained before, since here was more plate and gold than we could well
            carry away, by reason it is the emharcadero, or place where all the vast riches that are
            brought from the mountains of Potosy are shipped off for Panama, whence it goes into
            Spain. Now Captain Sharp was chosen again, his conduct being thought safer than any
            other man's, and they having had trial of another leader. Our surgeons we left behind
            had quarter from the enemy, they being able to do good service in that country ; but our
            wounded men were all knocked on the head, as we FURTHER DESERTIONS 275 understood
            afterwards. This misfortune fell to us on the 30th of January, being King Charles' day,
            as I can remember by some tokens. Having set sail from Arica, we cruized to and fro for
            the space of six weeks, but could meet with nothing that was to our purpose. By this
            time provisions grew scarce again, and our men began to mutiny anew ; some being for
            going home, and others for staying longer till they had got more moneys. To find them
            employment we put in at a place called Guasco. Here we landed some of our men, took some
            prisoners, and got in provisions, but did nothing else considerable. We landed again
            afterwards within two leagues of Ylo, or He lo he, where we took many prisoners, and
            thanked them for their former kindness unto us, which we had not yet forgotten, as they
            found by experience this time. After this, about the middle of April, 1681, our
            dissentions grew so high among us that above 40 more of our men deserted us, and in
            boats and canoes rowed away from us, to go home overland through the province of Darien,
            as their companions had done before. They steered their course in quest of St Maries
            River, belonging to that country, as was mentioned before : their chief grudge was
            against Captain Sharp, whom they envied and would not obey ; neither would we be brought
            to choose another Commander, knowing that neither by that means we should ever be able
            to keep them quiet. Thus we parted with them, allowing them what was necessary for their
            voyage, or they rather taking it away with them ; but we would not quarrel about it. Now
            our company and forces were extremely weakened, but our hearts as yet were good ; and,
            though we had met with many disappointments in several places, yet we hoped that at
            last, by some means or other, we should attain the ends of our desires, which was to
            enrich ourselves. Finding it very cold and bad weather in the latitude where we were, we
            sailed Northward, and about the beginning of May we came to the Gulf of Nicoya, where we
            anchored at an island called Chero. Here we took down our upper-deck, and sank our
            quarter-deck, and fitted ourselves very well to sea again. This was all performed by
            help of a Spanish carpenter and six or seven of his men, who were building some vessels
            in a river close by. We rewarded them for their pains with 276 DESERTION OF THE
            INTERPRETER one of our barks, which we gave them, and for their sakes turned loose all
            our prisoners, excepting some negroes, which we detailed to do our drudgery. One man was
            lost here, who was drowned, our drunken men overturning the boat as they came from
            shore. From Chero we went to the island of El Cavallo, where we lost our interpreter,
            who had done us good service all along, and at this place ran away from us, as we
            judged, unto the Spaniards, leaving behind him all that he had purchased in the voyage,
            which was worth nigh 500 pound in money and goods. What should be his intent in this
            action we could not know, except to betray us unto that nation. He was a Dutchman by
            birth, and his name James Marquis, and was very intelligent in the Spanish lingua, and
            besides that in several others. After his departure we had no great use for an
            interpreter, neither now did we much want one ; yet, in what occasions we had, we made
            use of one Mr. Ring- rose, who was with us in all this voyage, and being a good scholar
            and full of ingeniosity had also good skill in languages. This gentleman kept an exact
            and very curious Journal of all our voyage from our first setting out to the very last
            day ; took also all the observations we made, and likewise an accu- rate description of
            all the ports, towns, and lands we came to. His papers, or rather his diary, with all
            his drafts, are now in the hands of a person of my acquaintance at Wapping in London,
            and, as he telleth me, are very nigh being printed, which, if it be so, as I hope he
            will not fail to do it, I shall refer you for the truth of what I have here said, unto
            those papers ; for I desire to be corrected by them, if in any thing here delivered my
            memory has failed me, for I am certain he kept all along the best and truest account of
            all things that happened, beyond any man about us, and observed more particularities
            than any one else. Yet I am sure I have not much deviated from the truth in what is here
            set down ; only that, perhaps, I have omitted many things which I have for- gotten, my
            notes being very short concerning all the voyage. In June, 1 681, we cleaned our vessel
            in the gulf called Dulce, which we had not done so long before, and you may easily
            believe was by this time very foul. Having sailed thence, towards El Cabo de San
            Francisco, or Cape St Francis, some- where about that Cape in July we took a ship that
            was bound CAPTURE OF THE ROSARIO 277 for Panama and was laden with cacao-nuts, and had
            besides some small quantity of plate on board her. We took out of her the plate and
            goods, and what else we pleased, cut down the main-mast, and so let her go before the
            wind towards the port she was bound unto. About a fortnight after, at Cabo del Paffao,
            we took another small prize which was bound for Paita or Lima, that being the harbour,
            or landing-place, of all that goes up to that great city, the head of Peru. This was
            only a kind of packet-boat that was goin^ from Panama to Paita : she ran in under the
            shore when W6 gave her chase, and most of the passengers and other people got to land ;
            but we took the greatest part of them, and dismissed them the next day, not knowing what
            to do with them, so they were forced to foot it overland back again to Panama. The
            vessel likewise we turned loose before the wind, the next day after we had rummaged her
            pretty well, as having no farther service for her. The next after, we came up with
            another sail at Cape Paffao (where we took the packet-boat), which proved to be one of
            the greatest adventures of this whole voyage, if not the greatest of all, had we but
            known our own happy fortune, and how to make good use of it. This was a ship called El
            Santo Rosario, or The Holy Rosary, of an indifferent big burthen and loaded with brandy
            and oil, wine and fruit, besides good store of other provisions. They fired at us first,
            but we came up-board to board with them, and gave them such volleys of small shot that
            they were soon forced to surrender, having several of their men wounded, their Captain
            killed, and one only man more. In this ship, besides the lading above- mentioned, we
            found also almost 700 pigs of plate, but we took them to be some other metal, especially
            tin : and under this mistake they were slighted by us all, especially the Captain and
            seamen, who by no persuasions used by some few, who were for having them rummaged, could
            not be induced to take them into our ship, as we did most of the other things. Thus we
            left them on board the Rosario, aad, not knowing what to do with the bottom in that
            scarcity of men we were under, we turned her away loose unto the sea, being very glad we
            had got such good belly-timber out of her and thinking little what quantity of rich
            metal we left behind. It should seem this pUte was not yet thoroughly refined and fitted
            for to coin ; and this was the occasion that deceived us all. One 278 BOOK OF SEA-CHARTS
            only pig of plate, out of the whole number of almost 700, we took into our ship,
            thinking to make bullets of it ; and to this effect, or what else our seamen pleased,
            the greatest part of it was melted or squandered away. Afterwards, when we arrived at
            Antigua, we gave the remaining part of it, which was yet about one-third thereof, unto a
            Bristol man, who knew presently what it was (though he dissembled with us), brought it
            to England, and sold it there for seventy-five-pound sterling, as he confessed him^self
            afterwards to some of our men. Thus we parted with the richest booty we had gotten in
            the whole voyage, through our own ignorance and laziness. In this ship, the Rosario, we
            took also a great book full of sea-charts and maps, containing a very accurate and exact
            description of all the ports, sounding, creeks, rivers, capes, and coasts belonging to
            the South Sea, and all the navigations usually performed by the Spaniards in that ocean.
            This book, it seemeth, serveth them for an entire and complete Wagender^, in those
            parts, and for its novelty and curiosity was presented unto His Majesty after our return
            into England. It has been since translated into English, as I hear, by His Majesty's
            order, and the copy of the translation, made by a Jew, I have seen at Wapping ; but
            withal the printing thereof is severely prohibited, lest other nations should get into
            those seas and make use thereof, which is wished may be reserved only for England
            against its due time. The seaman who at first laid hold on it, on board the Rosario,
            told us the Spaniards were going to cast this book overboard, but that he prevented
            them, which notwithstanding we scarce did give entire credit unto, as knowing in what
            confusion they all were. Had the Captain himself been alive at that time, his story
            would have deserved more belief ; yet, howsoever, if the Spaniards did not attempt to
            throw this book into the sea, at least they ought to have done it for the reasons that
            are obvious to every man's under- standing and are hinted at before. We parted with the
            Rosario and her plate the last day of July, 1681. Here it was, at Cape Paffao,
            immediately after our turning away to sea the Rosario, and on the first or second day of
            Aitgust, 1681, that we set up our resolutions to seek no farther into those seas, but to
            come away for England round about the Strait of Magellan or by Strait Le Maire. This
            voyage ^ Lucas Wagenaer, Den Nieuwen Spieghel der Zccvaert . , . in diversche Zeecaerien
            begrepen ; folio, Amr.terdam 1596. THEY SAIL FOR ENGLAND 279 we thought less dangerous
            by far, seeing others had performed it before us, than to go overland, as our companions
            went, through such great and imminent dangers both of Indians and Spaniards ; through
            which nations, peradventure, we should be forced to fight our way almost every step we
            made : after which, when we came to the North Sea, we knew not how to get any shipping
            to convey us unto Jamaica ; for we could not question but our own ships were either
            departed long be- fore that time or at least taken up and carried away by our companions
            and deserters ; besides that we had too much goods and luggage to carry overland, taken
            out of our several prizes, which we were unwilling to lose. Our chief motives for this
            sudden departure for England were the huge scarcity of men we had at that present ; for
            now our whole number was reduced unto 64 men, whereof many were not fit to bear arms, as
            being negroes and others, that had only courage or skill to do our drudgery : this
            number, we feared, by any farther encounters might be so far lessened as scarce to be
            able to man our ship, at least to convey us home in safety; whereby, should we weaken it
            more, we might come to lose all we had got. And now we had purchased in the Rosario good
            store of provisions, especially of wine and brandy, sufficient to last, as we hoped, for
            such a voyage ; which, should we diminish upon farther adventures, we knew not when we
            should be so well provided again. The last motive was that most of our men had gotten
            pretty well by this voyage, and were afraid to lose by farther adventures what they had
            already purchased ; for, though some of our men had made away or lost all their money at
            play, yet others were so much the richer by their losses. For these reasons we set sail
            from Cape Paffao on the third day of August, to seek for the Strait of Magellan, or that
            of Le Maire, thereby to return into England, or at least unto the Leeward Islands. This
            voyage round about the Strait of Magellan, or rather beyond it, as also beyond the
            Strait of Le Maire, we performed in just six months, a day or two more or less, till we
            arrived at Antego at the end of January, 1681, having set forth from Cape Paffao, in the
            South Sea, at the beginning of August, 1681, as was said before. In all this long and
            tedious voyage very little happened unto us that was remarkable, neither had we any
            encounter with enemies either by sea or land that is 28o HOSTILE RECEPTION AT LIMA worth
            rehearsing — only two or three things I shall hint unto you by the by. At Paita, which
            is the landing-place, or harbour, belonging to the court of Lima, situated some few
            miles distant from the sea, we endeavoured to land some of our men upon the side of the
            bay. Having manned already our canoes for this intent with 30 or 40 men, which was now
            the greatest number we could spare, we descried many hundred men, both horse and foot,
            drawn up into battle-array, who waited for our landing. By this sight we perceived that
            we were discovered, and that the whole country was alarmed against us, whereby we judged
            it would be the greatest piece of rashness in the world to go ashore and throw
            ourselves, being so few, into the mouths of so many enemies. Hereupon we gave over the
            design we had against that rich place, went back into our ship, and sailed away for the
            Strait of Fernando de Magellan. In October we had very hard weather, that we had much
            ado to keep the seas. This was, if I well remember, about 50 degrees and a half of
            Southern latitude. Here, in this stress of weather, we spied a high land, unto which we
            made, and came to an anchor in a good harbour, where we moved our ship to the land. Here
            we stayed all the remaining part of that month, which was about three weeks, fishing and
            fowling for our maintenance, as much as the weather would permit us — thereby to save
            our other provisions. We took one Indian prisoner, but could not learn of him what
            country that was, as not understanding his language : we sought for others, but they
            were fled. These Indians are very wild, and do eat raw flesh. Unto this place we gave
            the name of the Duke of York's Island, more by guess than anything else ; for whether it
            were an island or continent we could not tell — only we conceived it to be so, and that
            other islands there might be adjoining unto it. One of our company, whose name was
            Shergall, was drowned as we went into the harbour, falling overboard from the
            sprit-sail-top. About the beginning of November, we set forth again hence, seeking for
            the Straits either of Magellan or Le Maire, but could find neither of them. The hardness
            of the weather was such that we missed both of them, and were driven many degrees beyond
            them : neither could we make any land, but came round about such a way as peradventure
            never any DISPERSAL OF THE BUCCANEERS 281 mortals came before us. Yet nothing remarkable
            did we see or meet withal, except hard weather, and here and there some floats of ice of
            two or three leagues long. We were very nigh 60 degrees of Southern latitude : this is
            all I can remember, not having any Journal nor the particular observations by me that
            were taken when the weather permitted. Thus we arrived, by God's infinite mercy, in
            safety at the island of Barbados, just at the latter end of January, 1681. Here a boat
            came off to us that belonged to the Richmond frigate : we were afraid of the said
            frigate, lest she should seize us for pirateering, and strip us of all we had got in the
            whole voyage. Hereupon we stood away for the isle of Antigua, but could not get leave to
            come into the harbour, though to obtain it we sent a present of jewels unto the Gover-
            nor's lady ; but he would not grant it, and our jewels were returned us very civilly.
            Hence we resolved every one to shift for ourselves : the ship in which we came home,
            which was the Trinity, as I have said before, taken by us at Panama, we gave away to
            seven or eight of our men who had payed away all their money. Thus we dispersed, some of
            our com- pany coming to England, others going to Jamaica, Barbados, New England,
            Virginia, and other places. The island of Bar- bados was the very first land we descried
            in the whole voyage of three-months' time, that is ever since we set out from the Duke
            of York's Island, as we named the place at the beginning of November. This navigation,
            performed by us, proves that several degrees more to the South of the Strait of
            Magellan, or that of Le Maire — especially about 58, 59, or 60 degrees of Southern
            latitude — there is a much easier passage from the North unto the South Sea than through
            either of these two Straits. Also that there is no such continent as Terra A ustralis
            incognita, as is named and described in all the ancient maps : so that it is but
            steering many degrees higher to the South and one may go as easily into the South Sea,
            or come thence into the North Sea, as we can go from England to Jamaica, only that the
            voyage, peradventure, will be something longer than by the Strait of Magellan, which
            makes not much to the purpose, but is rather much better seeing it is performed through
            an open sea and with less danger by far than through either of those Straits. All these
            things I hope will very dis- tinctly be made out in the papers, maps, and drafts of that
            282 TRIAL AT THE MARSHALSEA ingenious man Mr Ringrose above-mentioned, unto which I must
            of necessity refer you, against the time of their coming forth in print. Captain Sharp
            our Commander, myself, and several others came for England, soon after the performance
            of this voyage. Here several of us were put into prison and tried for our lives, at the
            suit of Don Pedro de Ronquillo, the Spanish Ambas- sador, for committing piracy and
            robberies in the South Sea ; but we were acquitted by a jury after a fair trial, they
            wanting witnesses to prove what they intended : neither had they had any at all against
            us, were it not for two or three villains of our own company, among which were two
            negroes who turned cat in the pan^, and had a spleen against Captain Sharp and others
            that had profited more by the voyage than they had done. One chief article against us
            was the taking of the Rosario and killing the Captain thereof and another man ; but it
            was proved the Spaniards fired at us first, as I have hinted at above, and thus it was
            judged we ought to defend ourselves. During the space of our imprisonment and trial
            several others of our company were forced to abscond and keep themselves concealed very
            close, for fear of being taken and brought under the same indictment. Also at Jamaica
            three of our company who arrived there were taken and cast into prison, and one of them
            was hanged who was wheedled into an open confession of his crime : the other two stood
            it out, and escaped, as I suppose, for want of witnesses to prove the fact against them.
            Our trial was at the Marshalsea in Southwark, by a Court of Admiralty. Thus far I have
            given you an account of our adventures in the South Sea. But here you inquire of me what
            is become of Captain Sharp since the time of his trial ? I must tell you I could wish I
            had a better account to give of him than what I have at present : he wasted all his
            money here in good fellowship in a short while after that he was set at liberty ; much
            he spent also while he was under confinement, so that he was soon reduced low, as most
            of the Buccaneers use to be after their voyages, according to what is truly enough
            related of them in that History. Having spent all his money, he resolved to go seek for
            m.ore, and that by the same means he ^ An old proverbial saying (occurring in Heywood's
            Proverhes, 1546): to prove perfidious, to change sides — probably a culinary metaphor,
            from cate (cake). THE LAST OF CAPTAIN SHARP 283 had used formerly ; yet an order there
            was, either from the Privy Council or the Court of Admiralty, that no Commander should
            carry him into those parts of the West Indies again, fearing lest he should do more
            mischief unto the Spaniards, contrary to the articles, beyond the line, for they had
            notice given them he intended to return thither to make new dis- coveries upon those
            coasts, and unto this effect had already taken up his passage in one of His Majesty's
            frigates — but this order prevented him. As for merchant-ships, they refused to carry
            ^lim, fearing he would tempt the men to revolt agninst the masters, and by this means
            run away with the ship to privateering, as he had done before. Not finding, therefore,
            any means to get out of England, he got together a Httle money, and with this he bought
            an old boat, which, as I am told, used to lie above London Bridge, for the sum of £20
            sterling. Into this boat he put a small quantity of butter and cheese, and a dozen or
            two pieces of beef : these were his provisions : his crew were only 16 m.en. With this
            equipage he sailed down the river, and came unto the Downs : hereabouts, as 'tis said,
            he met with a French vessel, which he clapt aboard, seized, and made himself master
            thereof. Presently after he sank his own boat, which he in- tended to carry no farther
            than until he could provide himself with a better bottom. Upon Romney Marsh he espied
            some cattle, and thereupon sent some men ashore to provide what they thought lit for the
            present victualling of their vessel. Thus he is gone out of England, but whither, upon
            what design, or what adventures he has met withal since, I cannot tell you. THE

            READER The general applause wherewith the History of the Buccaneers has been received
            could have no other effect than easily to persuade the Publisher of that piece to
            undertake the Second Volume thereof, especially considering that the same points which
            deserved the credit and commendation of the first did seem to subsist for the like
            esteem and reception of the second. These were the fidehty of the relations both here
            and there pubUshed, the authors having been not only eye-witnesses but also actors in
            the transactions they report ; the candour and sincerity of the style ; the variety and
            pleasantness of these voyages ; the greatness of the attempts here related ; the un-
            paralleled courage of the Buccaneers ; the strangeness of their performances ; the
            novelty of their exploits ; and, withal, the glory and grandeur of valour which here is
            seen to be inherent to our English nation, and as pregnant of great actions in the
            present as in the former ages. Unto which points may be added in this Second Volume for
            its recommendation the grand discovery of a new passage into the South Sea, beyond the
            Straits of Magellan and Le Maire through an open and in no wise dangerous ocean without
            those formidable perils from rocks, currents, and shoals which hitherto have rendered
            the two passages aforementioned altogether inaccessible to u 289 290 THE PREFACE TO THE
            READER trading : a navigation performed by Captain Sharp and his companions, many
            degrees beyond what Sir Francis Drake, Jacob Le Maire, Noord, or Magellan himself, who
            first circum- navigated the world, ever reached unto in their saiUngs. This discovery
            alone, as hugely beneficial to mankind, so may it seem sufficient of itself to recommend
            the present piece unto the public, even as extremely necessary to all such as navigaie
            the ocean, and no less delightful unto those persons whose studies are directed to the
            search of nature, to the arts of mathematics or navigation. Besides which point, both of
            art, curiosity, and usefulness, we have given unto us here by Mr Ringrose an exact
            account of many places in the South Sea ; the very draughts and maps of many ports,
            islands, bays, gulfs, points, and coasts, hitherto unknown to the greatest part of
            Europe — their appearance at sea, their surroundings, landings, and bearings ; together
            with what variety of winds and weather, of currents and calms, and other observations
            the Buccaneers experimented in those parts. All which things, as they manifest unto us
            the inquisitiveness of the author, so ought we highly to applaud his curiosity and
            genius, who all along the course of this voyage not only fought with his sword in the
            most desperate engagements and battles of the Bucca- neers against the Spaniards, but
            with his pen gave us a true account of those transactions, and with his pencil has de-
            lineated unto us the very scenes of those tragedies. Thus we find him totally employed
            towards our information and in- struction at home while he endured the greatest fatigues
            and hardship abroad : at the same time making quadrants at sea that others sat idle and
            murmuring upon the decks ; at the same time shipwrecked and almost naked and starving
            upon a desert island, and yet describing, even more exactly than the Spaniards
            themselves, the Gulf of Ballona (otherwise called of San Miguel) , where he was cast
            away. These things, I say, as they are not undeserving of the highest praise and
            commendation in this ingenious gentleman, Mr Ringrose their author, so shall the curios
            of nature and posterity itself be his eternal debtors for their acquaintance with these
            writings. Some imperfect account of these transactions, both short and in many things
            defective, I gave last year unto the public, at the end of the second impression of the
            History of the THE PREFACE TO THE READER 291 Buccaneers. But, such as that relation was,
            I had no better then to give ; neither had I then seen the present Journal of Mr
            Ringrose, and that same account being received from the hands of some of the Buccaneers
            themselves at Wapping, it was esteemed fit, both by me and others, to be published at
            that time. But as the author of those papers, mistrusting both his own memory and
            sufficiency, remits himself in that narrative unto the Journal of Mr Ringrose, and
            desires by this alone to be corrected or supplied either in what he was mis- taken or
            deficient — so now, this Diary being published, I hope I have vindicated myself from any
            fault in history, having brought these papers to light by which those others were
            beforehand both acknowledged and desired to be amended. As to my other Journal of this
            voyage, I shall not concern myself in the least with their veracity, nor meddle with
            their relations — knowing that, if any other person did take it, that no person in the
            voyage was so able as Mr Ringrose. Yet I know that divers narratives, in many points
            differing from one another, have at several times been made public of one and the same
            battle, one and the same siege, voyage, journey, or other transaction. And indeed all
            human affairs, whereso- ever reported by various persons, though all were present at the
            times and places of their circumvolution, are necessarily subject to some diversity in
            the rehearsal — one person observ- ing, omitting, contracting, dilating, understanding,
            or mis- taking one particular point or part of any transaction more than another. Having
            premised this much, I shall here only declare that what is here asserted shall be
            supported by Mr Ringrose him- self whenever he returns into England — yea, and owned for
            truth by Captain Bartholomew Sharp, as the chiefest actor in these affairs, as soon as
            he comes home again ; and, if any other person can show unto the world any Journal of
            the same voyage more complete, more exact, more elaborate, more curious and informing
            than Mr Ringrose has done, he shall deserve the laurel for me. The case being thus
            stated concerning the present narrative or Journal, I hope no person for the future will
            asperse or mis- construe the sincerity of my intentions in relation to the public. This
            I speak under that due resentment I ought to have for being traduced the last year by
            some persons who, 292 THE PREFACE TO THE READER being transported with too much passion
            and partiahty, would have nobody else to be an admirer of the person and valorous
            actions of Sir Henry Morgan or the rest of the Buccaneers but themselves. As if to
            publish a translation of the unparalleled exploits of that Jamaican hero — ^to give him
            this commend- able title ; to say that both he and his companions had acted beyond
            mortal men in America ; to compare them to Alex- ander, Julius Caesar, and the Nine
            Worthies of Fame ; to propose them unto our English nation as the truest patterns of
            undaunted and exemplary courage that it ever produced, were to disparage the conduct of
            Sir Henry Morgan and his companions — as if all this were intended only to diminish the
            glory of his actions and eclipse the splendour of his and their valorous triumphs.
            Methinks, if envy reach thus far, with the same reason or unjust measure those persons
            may say that to publish this present Journal is to divulge nothing else than a satire
            against Captain Sharp ; and that Mr Ringrose, who everywhere admires his conduct and
            extols his actions to the skies — yea, and was present himself and concerned in the same
            affairs — did mean nothing else than to traduce his own and Captain Sharp's name as
            infamous unto posterity. For my part, I judge myself so far distant from blemishing^ in
            the least or disparaging Sir Henry Morgan or his heroic actions, that I believe I have
            showed myself to be the greatest admirer of his personal valour and conduct — yea, I
            think I have done more towards the advantage both of the honour and credit of that great
            commander, by soliciting and pubHshing that trans- lation, than all the authors of our
            English nation besides. And I could unfeignedly wish that these persons who pretend to
            be so passionate for Sir Henry Morgan and his huge deserts as to misinterpret the
            sincere respects and service I have en- deavoured to perform unto his merits would outdo
            that I have already done in this particular, and give us either a more full, exact, and
            true account of his exploits, or the best panegyric of his prowess that ever was written
            ; and then experiment whether I did not readily embrace the printing such a thing at my
            own cost and charge, or rather render them ten thousand thanks for his commendations
            than carp at their actions for perusing and printing the same. ^ Aspersing : cf. Mrs.
            Hutchinson, Memoirs of Col. Hutchinson, ed. 1846, p. 51 : " Blemish not a man that is
            innocent." THE PREFACE TO THE READER 293 For what if the French or Dutch author of the
            History of the Buccaneers did mistake himself in two or three points re- lating to Sir
            Henry Morgan ? Must therefore the Publisher be blamed for faithfully printing what was
            most faithfully translated ? Must the saddle be set upon the wrong horse, and the faults
            of the author be imputed unto the printer ? Thus, if Mr Ringrose should happen to commit
            any mistake in these present papers, that blame should be presently mine ; and happy
            should be all authors if so readily their errors could be discharged upon the
            Publishers. Besides, what authors can there be found so accurate in all things as not to
            be subject now and then to some little lapses of their pen ? Were it so in John
            Esquemeling ; as he ought to be pardoned for any small peccadillo shot wittingly nor
            willingly committed, con- cerning what he relates of Sir Henry Morgan, so am I hitherto
            persuaded that he never designed to offend that great person, or falsely traduce his
            memory in the least. My argument is : Because he himself had the hand of a private
            Buccaneer in those affairs, he himself was a sharer in those booties, an actor in those
            enterprizes, and could no more blame Sir Henry Morgan for leading unto those attempts
            than blemish him- self for following unto them. Another reason, even more prevalent, is
            that he all along speaks more honourably of Sir Henry Morgan than of any other Commander
            of the Bucca- neers though they were his own countrymen, either Francis L'Ollonais or
            Roche BrasiHano, whereof the one was a Dutch- man and the other was born in France. So
            that to say that he represents the EngHsh Buccaneers as the worst of men is plainly to
            forget that he relates ten times greater villainies of his own nation and countrypeople
            ; and that the partiality they accuse him of, if any such can be found in that author,
            is rather bent against the French and other nations than the EngHsh. Does he in any
            place of his History lay all the faults and cruelties of the English Buccaneers upon Sir
            Henry Morgan ? Or do we believe that, if committed without order, as in most armies many
            things are so done, the General or Commander-in-Chief ought to be accountable for them ?
            Or, if those things were performed by order, that the Spaniards had not deserved them at
            the hands of the Buccaneers ? Aye, but he mistakes the pedigree of Sir Henry Morgan.
            Truly a great fault, and unpardonable in John Esquemehng, 2 94 THE PREFACE TO THE READER
            a foreigner to our nation and an illiterate Buccaneer, that he should not be better read
            in our English history ! So did he also mistake his very name, calling him Captain John
            Morgan (for Henry) ; but that fault was rectified in the translation. As if every
            private soldier ought to be thoroughly acquainted with the Christian name of his
            General, and know whether he was baptized John or Thomas, Richard or William ! Now what
            dishonour can it be refuted unto the merits of Sir Henry Morgan to be misrepresented by
            John Esquemeling, for the son of a rich yeoman in Wales, whereas at the same time he
            says that he was of good quality in that country even as most who bear that name in
            Wales are known to be ? Does not all our English nation know the family of the Morgans
            to be one of the ancientest and best qualified in all Wales or England, and that to be
            descended of a rich yeoman of the same family is as great an honour and as honourable a
            pedigree as any private gentleman needs to pretend to ? But then Sir Henry Morgan did
            not burn Panama. And what disgrace was it to that worthy person if he had set fire unto
            it, for those reasons he knew best himself ? Certainly no greater dishonour than to take
            and plunder the said city. Thus are all these persons so far transported with passion
            towards Sir Henry Morgan as to bereave him of the glory of his greatest actions, whether
            true or false. For, whether he fired the town or not (for that question I shall not make
            mine), this I am sure, that it was constantly so reported and be- lieved here in
            England, viz. that the English had set fire unto it, that unto this day the Buccaneers
            do believe it to be so ; and consequent unto this belief Mr Ringrose in these papers
            says plainly in some place or other that Panama was once burnt by Sir Henry Morgan ;
            that the Spaniards themselves never believed or reported this fact otherwise, neither
            will they easily be persuaded to the contrary unto this very day, as I am credibly
            informed by those persons who lived in Spain at the same time that the news of the
            taking of Panama was brought into Spain, and who have been resident there many years
            since. For what concerns what now is published that the Governor of Panama fired the
            town himself is rather believed by the Spaniards to be a sham of the Governor's making —
            thereby to save his own bacon — against whom they rail as the greatest coward that ever
            was, for deserting the town and flying to the THE PREFACE TO THE READER 295 mountains at
            the approach of the EngUsh. How then, say they, could he fire it himself, or give orders
            to have it fired, when we know he was upon the spur 30 or 40 miles distant from there ?
            Had he done it, he would have set fire unto every house before he had left the town and
            not so many hours after the English were in possession of the place and be at such a
            distance from it. Thus, both the English nation and the Spanisli having agreed to give
            the honour of this action, either truly or falsely, to Sir Henry Morgan, I cannot but
            admire that those who pretend to be the greatest admirers of his merits should endeavour
            to divest him of it. What concerns two or three points more relating to Sir Henry Morgan
            in the History of the Buccaneers : I shall not undertake to apologize for John
            Esquemeling, in case he has misrepresented them. All I shall say is this : that that
            worthy person is not the first General or Chief Commander whose actions have been
            misconstrued or misunderstood by the common soldiers, and consequently ill represented
            by them at home. Neither is anything in this world more subject to glosses and false
            representations than the heroic actions of great men by their servants or inferiors. If
            this be the case of John Esquemeling, and that he was mal-contented with his fortune at
            Panama, what is that to me ? What fault was that of mine ? Meanwhile, why have not these
            persons so zealous of the honour of Sir Henry Morgan given us the true Journal of his
            huge exploits, but rather suffer his famous actions to lie dormant for so many years in
            England at the same time that other nations have published them abroad ? And then why
            must I be blamed by these persons, his admirers, for doing for the renown of Sir Henry
            Morgan what I could, if I could not do so much as I would willingly have done ? [The
            Publisher]. PART IV CHAPTER I Captain Coxon, Sawkins, Sharp, and others set forth in a
            fleet towards the province ofDarien, upon the continent of America. Their designs to
            pillage and plunder in those parts. Number of their ships, and strength of their forces
            by sea and land At a place called Boca del Toro was the general rendezvous of the fleet,
            which lately had taken and sacked Porto Bello the second time — that rich place having
            been taken once before, under the conduct of Sir Henry Morgan, as is related in the
            History of the Buccaneers. At this place also were two other vessels, the one belonging
            to Captain Peter Harris, and the other to Captain Richard Sawkins ; both Englishmen and
            privateers. Here, therefore, a report was made to the fleet of a peace concluded between
            the Spaniards and the Indians of the land of Darien, who for the most part wage
            incessant wars against one another. Also, that since the conclusion of the said peace
            they had been already tried and found very faithful unto Captain Bournano, a French
            commander, in an attempt on a certain place called Chepo, near the South Sea. Further,
            that the Indians had promised to conduct him to a great and very rich place named Toca-
            mora ; upon which he had hkewise promised them to return in three months time with more
            ships and men. Hereupon we all agreed to go and visit the said place, and thus dispersed
            ourselves into several coves (by the Spaniards called cuevas, or hollow creeks under the
            coasts), there to careen and fit our vessels for that purpose. In this place, Boca del
            Toro, 297 2 98 THE FLEET SETS FORTH we found plenty of fat tortoises, the pleasantest
            meat in the world. When we had refitted our vessels, we met at an island called by us
            the Water-key ; and this was then our strength, as follows : — Tons Guns Men Captain

            Row 20 25 Captain Mackett 14 20 We sailed thence March 23rd, 1679, and in our way
            touched at the islands called Samballas. These are certain islands, reaching eight
            leagues in extent and lying fourteen leagues Westward of the river of Darien. Being here
            at anchor, many of the Indians, both men and women, came to see us. Some brought
            plantains, others other fruits and venison, to exchange with us for beads, needles,
            knives, or any trifling bauble whereof they stand in need. But what they most chiefly
            covet are axes and hatchets to fell timber withal. The men here go almost naked, as
            having only a sharp and hollow tip, made either of gold, silver, or bark, into which
            they thrust their privy members, which tip they fasten with a string about their middle.
            They wear as an ornament in their noses a golden or silver plate, in shape like a
            half-moon, which, when they drink, they hold up with one hand while they lift the cup
            with the other. They paint themselves sometimes with streaks of black ; as the women do
            in like manner with red. These have in their noses a pretty thick ring of gold or silver
            ; and for clothing they cover themselves with a blanket. They are generally
            well-featured women : among them I saw several fairer than the fairest of Europe, with
            hair like the finest flax. Of these it is reported they can see far better in the dark
            than in the light. These Indians mishked our design for Tocamora, and dissuaded us from
            it, asserting it would prove too tedious a march, and the way so mountainous and
            uninhabited that it would be extremely difficult to get provisions for our men. Withal
            they proffered to guide us, undescried, within a few THE SAMBALLAS ISLANDS 299 leagues
            of the city of Panama, in case we were pleased to go thither, where we could not choose
            but ourselves know we should not fail of making a good voyage. Upon these and other
            reasons which they gave us, we concluded to desist from the journey of Tocamora and to
            proceed to Panama. Having taken these resolutions, Captain Bournano's and Captain Row's
            vessels separated from us, as being all French and not willing to go to Panama, they
            declaring themselves generally against a long march by land. Thus we left them at the
            Samballas. Thence an Indian Captain, or Chief Com- mander, named Andraeas, conducted us
            to another island called by the English The Golden Island, situated somewhat to the
            Westward of the mouth of the great river of Darien. At this island we met, being in all
            seven sail, on April 3rd, 1680. Here at The Golden Island the Indians gave us notice of
            a town called Santa Maria, situated on a great river which bears the same name and which
            runs into the South Sea by the Gulf of San Miguel. In the town was kept a garrison of
            400 soldiers ; and from this place much gold was carried to Panama which was gathered
            from the mountains thereabouts. In case we should not find sufficient purchase there, we
            might thence proceed by sea to Panama, where we could not easily fail of our designs.
            This motion of the Indians we liked so well that we landed 331 men, on April 5th, 1680,
            leaving Captains Alleston and Mackett with a party of seamen to guard our ships in our
            absence with which we intended to return home. The men that were landed had each of them
            three or four cakes of bread (called by the English doughboys i) for their provision of
            victuals ; and for drink the rivers afforded enough. At the time of our landing Captain
            Sharp was very faint and weak, having had a great fit of sickness lately, from which he
            had scarcely recovered. Our several com- panies that marched were distinguished as
            follows. First, 1 A nautical term for hard dumplings boiled in sea-water : cf. Dampier,
            Voyages (1697), ed. 1729, i, 5, 1 10 : " This we served instead of butter, to eat with
            the Dough-boys or dumplins." Still in use in the navy : cf. Pall Mall Budget, 22 Aug.,
            1887, p. 13, col. 2 : " Each man had also a dough-boy made with J lb. of flour and
            boiled in the soup." The modern use of the word to designate an American private soldier
            refers to the shape of the buttons on his tunic. 30O PROVISIONS AND COLOURS Captain
            Bartholomew Sharp with his company had a red flag, with a bunch of white and green
            ribbons. The second division, led by Captain Richard Sawkins with his men, had a red
            flag striped with yellow. The third and fourth, led by Captain Peter Harris, had two
            green flags, his company being divided into two several divisions. The fifth and sixth,
            led by Captain John Coxon, who had some of AUeston's and Mackett's men joined to his,
            made two divisions or companies, and had each of them a red flag. The seventh was led by
            Captain Edmund Cook, with red colours striped with yellow, with a hand and sword for his
            device. All or most of them were armed with fuzee, pistol, and hanger. CHAPTER II They
            march towards the town of Santa Maria with design to take it. The Indian King of Darien
            meets them by the way. Difficulties of this march, with other occurrences till they
            arrive at the place Being landed on the coast of Darien, and divided into com- panies as
            was mentioned in the preceding chapter, we began our march towards Santa Maria, the
            Indians serving us for guides in that unknown country. Thus we marched at first through
            a small skirt of a wood, and then over a bay almost a league in length. After that, we
            went two leagues directly up a woody valley, where we saw here and there an old
            plantation, and had a very good path to march in. There we came to the side of a river,
            which in most places was dry, and built us houses, or rather huts, to lodge in. Unto
            this place came to us another Indian, who was a chief commander and a man of great
            parts, named Captain Antonio. This Indian officer encouraged us very much to undertake
            the journey to Santa Maria, and promised to be our leader, saying he would go along with
            us now but that his child lay very sick. However, he was assured it would die by the
            next day, and then he would most certainly follow and overtake us. Withal he desired we
            would not lie in the grass for fear of monstrous adders, which are very frequent in
            those places. Breaking some of the stones that lay in the river, we found them shine
            with sparks of gold. These stones are driven down from the neighbouring mountains in
            time of floods. This day four of our men tired, and returned to the ships. So we
            remained in all 327 men, with 6 Indians to conduct us. That night some showers of rain
            fell. The next day of our march we mounted a very steep hill, and on the other side at
            the foot thereof we rested on the 301 302 THIRD DAY'S MARCH bank of a river, which
            Captain Andraeas told us ran into the South Sea, being the same river on which the town
            of Santa Maria was situated. Hence we continued our march until noon, and then ascended
            another mountain very much higher than the former. Here we ran much danger often- times
            and in many places, the mountain being so perpendicular and the path so narrow that but
            one man at a time could pass. We arrived by the dark of the evening to the other side of
            the mountain, and lodged again by the side of the same river, having marched that day,
            according to our reckoning, about i8 miles. This night likewise some rain fell. The next
            morning being April 7th, we marched all along the river aforementioned, crossing it
            often, almost at every half-mile, sometimes up to the knees and at other times up to the
            middle in a very swift current. About noon we came to a place where we found some Indian
            houses. These were very large and neat : the sides were built with cabbage-trees, and
            the roofs of wild canes thatched with palmetto royal, but far neater than ours at
            Jamaica. They had many divisions into rooms, though no ascent by stairs into chambers.
            At this place were four of these houses together, that is, within a stone's throw one of
            another, each of them having a large plantain-walk before it. At the distance of
            half-a-mile from this place lived the King or chief Captain of these Indians of Darien,
            who came to visit us in royal robes with his queen and family. His crown was made of
            small white reeds, which were curiously woven, having no other top than its lining,
            which was of red silk. Round about the middle of it was a thin plate of gold, more than
            two-inches broad, laced behind — whence did stick two or three ostrich-feathers. About
            this plate went also a row of golden beads, which were bigger than ordinary peas ;
            underneath which the red lining of the crown was seen. In his nose he wore a large plate
            of gold in the form of a half-moon, and in each ear a great golden ring, nearly
            four-inches in diameter, with a round thin plate of gold of the same breadth, having a
            small hole in the centre by which it hung to the ring. He was covered with a thin,
            white, cotton robe, reaching to the small of his legs, and round its bottom a fringe of
            the same, three-inches deep. So that by the length of this robe our sight was impeded,
            that we could see no higher than his naked ankles. In his hand he had a FOURTH DAY'S
            MARCH 303 long bright lance, as sharp as any knife. With him he had three sons, each of
            them having a white robe, and their lances in their hands, but standing bareheaded
            before him ; as also were eight or nine persons more of his retinue, or guard. His queen
            wore a red blanket, which was closely girt about her waist, and another that came
            loosely over her head and shoulders, like our old-fashioned striped hangings. She had a
            young child in her arms, and two daughters walked by her, both marriageable, with their
            faces almost covered with stripes or streaks of red, and almost laden about their neck
            and arms with small beads of several colours. These Indian women of the province of
            Darien are generally very free, airy, and brisk, yet withal very modest, and cautious in
            their husbands' presence, of whose jealousy they stand in fear. With these Indians we
            made an exchange, or had a truck as it is called, for knives, pins, needles, or any
            other such like trifles ; but in our deaUng with them we found them to be very cunning.
            Here we rested ourselves for the space of one day, and withal chose Captain Sawkins to
            lead the Forlorn, to whom, for that purpose, we gave the choice of four-score men. The
            King ordered us each man to have three plantains, with sugar- canes to suck, by way of a
            present. But, when these were consumed, if we could not truck we must have starved, for
            the king himself did not refuse to deal for his plantains. This sort of fruit is first
            reduced to mash, then laid between leaves of the same tree, and so used with water ;
            after which preparation they call it miscelaw. On April 9th we continued our march along
            the banks of the river above-mentioned, finding on our way here and there a house. The
            owners of the said houses would most com- monly stand at the door, and give, as we
            passed by, to every one of us either a ripe plantain or some sweet cassava-root. Some of
            them would count us by dropping a grain of corn for each man that passed before them,
            for they know no greater number, nor can count no farther, than twenty. That night we
            arrived at three great Indian houses, where we took up our lodgings, the weather being
            clear and serene all night. The next day Captain Sharp, Captain Coxon, and Captain Cook,
            with about threescore-and-ten of our men, embarked themselves in fourteen canoes upon
            the river, to glide down 304 SIXTH DAY'S MARCH the stream. Among this number I also
            embarked, and we had in our company our Indian Captain Andraeas, of whom mention was
            made above, and two Indians more in each canoe, to pilot or guide us down the river.
            But, if we had been tired whilst travelling by land before, certainly we were in a worse
            condition now in our canoes. For at the distance of almost every stone's cast we were
            constrained to quit and get out of our boats, and haul them over either sands or rocks,
            and at other times over trees that lay across and filled up the river so that they
            hindered our navigation ; yea, several times over the very points of land itself. That
            very night we built ourselves huts for shelter upon the riverside, and rested our
            wearied limbs until next morning. This being come, we prosecuted our journey all day
            long with the same fatigue and toil as \ve had done the day before. At night came a
            tiger and looked on us for some while, but we did not dare to fire at the animal,
            fearing we should be descried by the sound of our fuzees — the Spaniards, as we were
            told, not being at any great distance from that place. But the next day, which was April
            12th, our pain and labour was rather doubled than diminished — not only for the
            difficulties of the way, which were intolerable, but chiefly for the absence of our main
            body of men, from whom we had parted the day before. For now, hearing no news of them,
            we grew extremely jealous of the Indians and their councils, suspecting a design of
            those people thus to divide our forces and then, by cutting us off, to betray us to the
            Spaniards, our implacable enemies. That night we rested ourselves by building huts, as
            we had done and as has been mentioned before. On Tuesday morning, the next ensuing day,
            we continued our navigation down the river, and arrived at a beachy point of land, at
            which place another arm joins the same river. Here, as we understood, the Indians of
            Darien did usually rendezvous whensoever they drew up in a body with intention to fight
            their ancient enemies, the Spaniards. Here also we made a halt, or waited for the rest
            of our forces and company, the Indians having now sent to seek them, as being themselves
            not a little concerned at our dissatisfaction and jealousies. In the afternoon our
            companions came up with us, and were hugely glad to see us, they having been in no
            EIGHTH DAY'S MARCH 305 less fear for us than we had been at the same time for them. We
            remained and rested there that night also, with design to fit our arms for action, which
            now, as we were told, was near at hand. We departed thence early the next morning, which
            was the last day of our march, having in all now the number of threescore-and-eight
            canoes, wherein were embarked 327 of us Englishmen, and 50 Indians, who served us for
            guides. To the point above-mentioned the Indians had hitherto guided our canoes with
            long poles or sticks ; but now we made ourselves oars and paddles to row with, thus to
            make what speed we could. Thus we rowed with all haste imagin- able, and upon the river
            we happened to meet two or three Indian canoes that were laden with plantains. About
            mid- night we arrived and landed at the distance of half-a-mile more or less from the
            town of Santa Maria, whither our march was all along intended. The place where we landed
            was deeply muddy, insomuch that we were constrained to lay our paddles on the mud to
            wade upon, and withal lift our- selves up by the boughs of the trees to support our
            bodies from sinking. Afterwards we were forced to cut our way through the woods for some
            space, where we took up our lodgings for that night, for fear of being discovered by the
            enemy, to whom we were so near. CHAPTER III They take the town of Santa Maria with no
            loss of men, and hut small booty of what they fought for. Description of the place,
            country, and river adjacent. They resolve to go and plunder for the second time the city
            of Panama The next morning, which was Thursday, April 15th, about break of day, we heard
            from the town a small arm discharged, and after that a drum beating a travailler. With
            this we were roused from our sleep, and, taking up our arms, we put our- selves in order
            and marched towards the town. As soon as we came out of the woods into the open ground,
            we were descried by the Spaniards, who had received inteUigence beforehand of our
            coming, and were prepared to receive us, having already conveyed away all their treasure
            of gold and sent it to Panama. They ran immediately into a large palisaded fort, having
            each pale or post twelve-foot high, and began to fire very briskly at us as we came. But
            our vanguard ran up to the place, and, pulling down two or three of their palisades,
            entered the fort incontinently, and made themselves masters thereof. In this action not
            fifty of our men had come up before the fort was taken, and on our side only two were
            wounded, and not one killed. Notwithstanding, within the place were found two hundred
            and three-score men, besides which number two-hundred others were said to be absent,
            having gone up into the country to the mines to fetch down gold, or rather to convey
            away what was already in the town. This golden treasure comes down another branch of
            this river to Santa Maria from the neighbouring mountains, where are thought to be the
            richest mines of the Indies, or at least of all these parts of the Western world. Of the
            Spaniards we killed in the assault 26, and wounded to the number of 16 more. But their
            governor, their priest, and all or most of their chief men made their escape by flight.
            306 REDEMPTION OF KING'S DAUGHTER 307 Ha.ving taken the fort, we expected to find here a
            consider- able town belonging to it. But it proved to be only some wild houses made of
            cane, the place being chiefly a garrison designed to keep in subjection the Indians, who
            bear a mortal hatred towards, and are often apt to rebel against, the Spaniards. But,
            bad as the place was, our fortune was much worse. For we came only three days too late
            to meet with three-hundred-weight of gold, which was carried thence to Panama in a bark
            that is sent thence twice or thrice every year to fetch the gold brought to Santa Maria
            from the mountains. This river, called by the name of the town, is hereabouts twice as
            broad as the river Thames at London, and flows above three-score miles upwards, rising
            to the height of two-fathom-and-a-half at the town itself. As soon as we had taken the
            place, the Indians who belonged to our company and had served us for guides came up to
            the town. For whilst they heard the noise of the guns they were in great consternation
            and dared not approach the palisades, but hid themselves closely in a small hollow, so
            that the bullets, while we were fighting, flew over their heads. Here we found and
            redeemed the eldest daughter of the King of Darien, of whom we made mention above. She
            had, as it should seem, been forced away from her father's house by one of the garrison
            (which rape had hugely incensed him against the Spaniards), and was with child by him.
            After the fight the Indians destroyed as many of the Spaniards as we had done in the
            assault, by taking them into the adjoining woods and there stabbing them to death with
            their lances. But, so soon as we learnt of this barbarous cruelty, we hindered them from
            taking any more out of the fort, where we confined them every one prisoners. Captain
            Sawkins, with a small party of ten more, put himself into a canoe and went down the
            river, to pursue and stop, if it were possible, those that had escaped, for they were
            the chief people of the town and garrison. But now, our great expectations of taking a
            huge booty of gold at this place being totally vanished, we were unwilling to have come
            so far for nothing, or to go back empty-handed, especially considering what vast riches
            were to be had at no great distance. Hereupon we resolved to go to Panama, [in] which
            place, if we could take [it], we were assured we should get treasure enough to satisfy
            our hungry 3o8 CAPTURE OF SANTA MARIA appetite for gold and riches, that city being the
            receptacle of all the plate, jewels, and gold that is dug out of the mines of all Potosi
            and Peru. Unto this effect, therefore, and to please the humours of some of our company,
            we made choice of Captain Coxon as our General or Commander-in-chief. Before our
            departure we sent back what small booty we had taken here by some prisoners under the
            charge of twelve of our men, to convey it to the ships. Thus we prepared to go forward
            on that dangerous enter- prise of Panama. But the Indians who had conducted us having
            got from us what knives, scissors, axes, needles, and beads they could, would not stay
            any longer, but all, or the greater part of them, returned to their home. Which not-
            withstanding, the king himself. Captain Andraeas, Captain Antonio, the king's son,
            called by the Spaniards Bonete de Oro, or King Golden-Cap, as also his kinsman, would
            not be persuaded by their falHng off to leave us, but resolved to go to Panama, out of
            the desire they had to see that place taken and sacked. Yea, the king promised, if there
            should be occasion, to join 50,000 men to our forces. Besides which promises, we had
            also another very considerable encourage- ment to undertake this journey. For the
            Spaniard who had forced away the king's daughter, as was mentioned above, fearing lest
            we should leave him to the mercy of the Indians, who would have but little mercy on him,
            having shown themselves so cruel to the rest of his companions, for the safety of his
            Hfe had promised to lead us not only into the town but even to the very bedchamber door
            of the governor of Panama, and that we should take him by the hand and seize both him
            and the whole city before we should be discovered by the Spaniards, either before or
            after our arrival. CHAPTER IV The Buccaneers leave the town of Santa Maria, and proceed
            by sea to take Panama. Extreme difficulties, with sundry acci- dents and dangers of thai
            voyage Having been in possession of the town of Santa Maria only the space of two days,
            we departed thence on Saturday, April 17th, 1680. We all embarked in 35 canoes and a
            peri- agua^, which we had taken here lying at anchor before the town. Thus we sailed, or
            rather rowed, down the river in quest of the South Sea, upon which Panama is seated,
            towards the Gulf of Ballona, whereat we were to disembogue^ into that ocean. Our
            prisoners, the Spaniards, begged very earnestly that they might be permitted to go with
            us and not be left to the mercy of the Indians, who would show them no favour and whose
            cruelty they so much feared. But we had much ado to find a sufficient number of boats
            for ourselves, the Indians that left us having taken with them, either by consent or
            stealth, so many canoes. Yet, notwithstanding this, they found soon after either bark
            logs, or old canoes, and by that means shifted so well for their lives as to come along
            with us. Before our departure we burnt both the fort, the church, and the town, which
            was done at the request of the King, he being extremely incensed against it. Among these
            canoes it was my misfortune to have one that was very heavy, and consequently sluggish.
            By this means we were left behind the rest a little way, there being only four * A

            3IO BUCCANEERS LEAVE SANTA MARIA men besides myself that were embarked therein. As the
            tide fell, it left several shoals of sand naked, and hence, we not knowing of the true
            channel amongst such a variety of streams, happened to steer within a shoal for above
            two miles before we perceived our error. Hereupon we Were forced to lay by until high
            water came, for to row in such heavy boats against the tide is totally impossible. As
            soon as the tide began to turn, we rowed away in prosecution of our voyage, and withal
            made what haste we could ; but all our endeavours were in vain, for we could neither
            find nor overtake our com- panions. Thus at about ten o'clock at night, the tide being
            low, we stuck up an oar in the river, and slept by turns in our canoe, several showers
            of rain falling all the night long which pierced us to the skin. But, the next morning,
            no sooner had day come than we rowed away down the river as before, in pursuit of our
            people. Having gone about the space of two leagues, we were so fortunate as to overtake
            them. For they had lain that night at an Indian hut, or embarcadero, that is to say
            landing place, and had been taking in water till then. Being arrived at the place, they
            told us that we must not omit to fill our jars there with water, otherwise we should
            meet with none in the space of six days' time. Hereupon we went every one of us the
            distance of a quarter-of-a-mile from the embarcadero to a little pond to fill our water
            in calabashes, making what haste we could back to our canoe. But, when we returned, we
            found not one of our men, they all being departed and already got out of sight. Such is
            the procedure of these wild men that they care not in the least whom they lose of their
            com- pany or leave behind. We were now more troubled in our minds than before, fearing
            lest we should fall into the same misfortune we had so lately overcome. Hereupon we
            rowed after them as fast as we possibly could, but ail in vain. For here are found such
            huge numbers of islands, greater and lesser, as also quays about the mouth of the river,
            that it was not diificult for us, who were un- acquainted with the river, to lose
            ourselves a second time amongst them. Yet notwithstanding, though with much trouble and
            toil, we found at last that mouth of the river that is called by the Spaniards Boca
            Chica, or The Little Mouth. But, as it happened, it was now young flood, and the A
            TEDIOUS NIGHT 311 stream ran very violently against us ; so that, though we were not
            above a stone's cast from the said mouth, and this was witliin a league broad, yet we
            could not by any means come near it. Hence we were forced to put ashore, which we did
            accordingly, until high-water. We hauled our canoe close by the bushes, and, when we got
            out, we fastened our rope to a tree, which the tide had almost covered, for it flows
            here nearly four-fathom deep. As soon as the tide began to turn, we rowed away from
            there to an island, distant about a league and a half from the mouth of the river, in
            the Gulf of San Miguel. Here in the gulf it went very hard with us whensoever any wave
            dashed against the sides of our canoe, for it was nearly twenty-feet in length and yet
            not quite one-foot-and-a-half in breadth where it was at the broadest, so that we had
            only just room enough to sit down in her, and a little water would easily have both
            filled and overwhelmed us. At the island aforesaid we took up our resting-place for that
            night, though it was, from the loss of our company and the great dangers we were in, the
            sorrowfullest night that until then I had ever experienced in my whole life. For it
            rained impetuously all night long, insomuch that we were wet from head to foot and had
            not one dry thread about us ; neither, through the violence of the rain, were we able to
            keep any fire burning wherewith to warm or dry ourselves. The tide ebbs here a good
            half- mile from the mark of high-water, and leaves bare wonderfully high and
            sharp-pointed rocks. We passed this heavy and tedious night without one minute of sleep,
            being all very sorrowful to see ourselves so far and remote from the rest of our
            companions, as also totally destitute of all human com- fort ; for a vast sea surrounded
            us on one side and the mighty power of our enemies, the Spaniards, on the other. Neither
            could we descry at any hand the least thing to relieve us, all that we could see being
            the wide sea, high mountains, and rocks ; while we ourselves were confined to an
            egg-shell, instead of a boat, without so much as a few clothes to defend us from the
            injuries of the weather. For at that time none of us had a shoe to our feet. We searched
            the whole quay to see if we could find any water, but found none. CHAPTER V Shipwreck of

            loss of his companiojis till he found them again. Description of the Gulf of Vallona On
            Monday, April 19th, at break of day, we hauled our canoe into the water again, and
            departed from the island aforementioned : wet and cold as we were, we rowed away towards
            the Punta de San Lorenzo, or Point St Lawrence. In our way we met with several islands
            which lie straggling thereabouts. But now we were again so hard put to it by the
            smallness of our vessel and being in an open sea, that it had become the work of one
            man, yea sometimes of two, to cast out the water, which came in on all sides of our
            canoe. After struggling for some time with these difficulties, as we came near one of
            those islands a heavy sea overturned our boat, by which means we were all forced to swim
            for our lives. But we soon got to the shore, and to the same place our canoe came
            tumbling after us. Our arms were very fast lashed to the inside of the boat, and our
            locks were as well cased and waxed down as was possible ; so were also our cartouche-
            boxes and powder-horns. But all our bread and fresh water was utterly spoilt and lost.
            Our canoe being tumbled on shore by the force of the waves, our first business was to
            take out and clear our arms. This we had scarcely done when we saw another canoe fall
            into the same misfortune at a little distance to leeward of us, amongst a great number
            of rocks that bounded the island. The persons that were cast away proved to be six
            Spaniards of the garrison of Santa Maria, who had found an old canoe and had followed us
            to escape the cruelty of the Indians. 312 SHIPWRECK OF MR RINGROSE 313 They presently
            came to us, and made us a fire ; which being done, we got our meat and broiled it on the
            coals, and all of us ate amicably together. But we stood in great need of water, or
            other drink to our victuals, not knowing in the least where to get any. Our canoe was
            thrown up by the waves to the edge of the water, and there was no great fear of its
            splitting, being full six inches in thickness, on the sides thereof. But that in which
            the Spaniards came split itself against the rocks, being old and slender, into an
            hundred pieces. Though we were thus shipwrecked and driven ashore, as I have related,
            yet otherwise and at other times is this Gulf of San Miguel a mere mill-pond for
            smoothness of water. My company was now altogether for returning and pro- ceeding no
            farther, but rather for living amongst the Indians, in case we could not reach the ships
            we had left behind us in the Northern Sea. But with much ado I prevailed with them to go
            forward at least one day longer, and, in case we found not our people the next day, that
            then I would be willing to do anything which they should think fit. Thus we spent two or
            three hours of the day in consulting about our affairs, and withal keeping a man to
            watch and look out on all sides for fear of any surprisal by the Indians or other
            enemies. About the time that we were come to a conclusion in our debates, our watchman
            by chance spied an Indian, who, as soon as he saw us, ran into the woods. I sent
            immediately two of my company after him, who overtook him, and found that he was one of
            our friendly Indians. Thus he led them to a place not far distant where seven more of
            his company were with a great canoe which they had brought with them. They came to the
            place where I was with the rest of my company, and seemed to be glad to meet us on that
            island. I asked them by signs for the main body of our company, and they gave me to
            understand that if we would go with them in their canoe, which was much bigger than
            ours, we should be up with the party by the next morning. This news, as may easily be
            supposed, not a little rejoiced our hearts. Presently, after this friendly invitation,
            they asked who the other six men were whom they saw in our company, for they easily
            perceived us not to be all of one and the same coat and lingua. We told them they were '
            Wankers ', which is the name they commonly give to the Spaniards in their own 314
            SHIPWRECK OF MR RINGROSE language. Their next question was, if they should kill those
            Spaniards ; but I answered them : No, by no means ; I would not consent to have it done.
            With which answer they seemed to be satisfied for the present. But, a Uttle while after,
            my back being turned, my company thinking that they should thereby oblige the Indians,
            beckoned to them to kill the Spaniards. With this the poor creatures, perceiving the
            danger that threatened them, made a sad shriek and outcry, and I came in time to save
            all their hves. But withal I was forced to give way and consent that they should have
            one of them for to make their slave. Hereupon I gave the canoe that I came in to the
            five Spaniards remaining, and bid them get away and shift for their lives, lest those
            cruel Indians should not keep their word, and they should run the same danger again they
            had so lately escaped. Having sent them away whilst I rested myself here, I took a
            survey of this gulf and the mouth of the river, which I finished the same day, and do
            here present to the view of the reader. But now, thanks be to God, joining company with
            those Indians, we got into a very large canoe, which for its bigness was better able to
            carry twenty men than our own that we had brought to carry five. The Indians had also
            fitted a very good sail to the said canoe, so that, having now a fresh and strong gale
            of wind, we set sail thence, and made therewith brave way, to the infinite joy and
            comfort of our hearts, seeing ourselves so well accommodated and so happily rid of the
            miseries we but lately had endured. We had now a smooth and easy passage after such
            tedious and laboursome pains as we had sustained in coming so far since w^e left Santa
            Maria. Under the point of St Lawrence, mentioned above, is a very great rippling of the
            sea, occasioned by a strong current which runs hereabouts, and which often alm.ost
            filled our boat with its dashes as we sailed. This evening, after our departure from the
            island where we were cast away, it rained vehemently for several hours, and the night
            proved to be very dark. About nine o'clock that night we descried two fires on the shore
            of the continent over against us. These fires were no sooner perceived by the Indians of
            our canoe than they began to shout for joy and cry out. Captain Antonio, Captain
            Andrceas, the names of their Indian Captains and leaders ; and to affirm they were
            assured those fires were made CAPTURED BY SPANIARDS 315 by their companions. Hence they
            made for the shore towards those fires as fast as they could drive. But, so soon as our
            canoe came among the breakers nigh the shore, out came from the woods about three-score
            Spaniards with clubs and other arms, and, laying hold of our canoe on both sides
            thereof, hauled it out of the water quite dry ; so that by this means we were all
            suddenly taken and made their prisoners. I laid hold of my gun, thinking to make some
            defence for my- self ; but all was in vain, for they suddenly seized me between four or
            five of them and hindered me from action. Meanwhile our Indians leaped overboard, and
            got away very nimbly into the woods, my companions standing amazed at what had happened
            and the manner of our surprisal. I asked them presently if any of them could speak
            either French or English ; but they answered : No. Hereupon, as well as I could I
            discoursed to some of them, who were more intelli- gent than the rest, in Latin, and by
            degrees came to under- stand their condition. These were Spaniards who had been 31 6
            THEY ARE CIVILLY TREATED turned ashore here by our EngHsh party, who left them upon this
            coast lest by carrying them nearer to Panama any of them should make their escape and
            discover our march towards that city. They had me, presently after I was taken, into a
            small hut which they had built, covered with boughs, and made there great shouts for
            joy, because they had taken us, designing in their minds to use us very severely for
            coming into those parts, and especially for taking and plundering their town of Santa
            Maria. But, while the captain of those Spaniards was examining me, in came the poor
            Spaniard that was come along with us, and reported how kind I had been to him and the
            rest of his companions, by saving their lives from the cruelty of the Indians. The
            captain, having heard him, arose from his seat immedi- ately and embraced me, saying
            that we Englishmen were very friendly enemies and good people, but that the Indians were
            very rogues and a treacherous nation. Withal he desired me to sit down by him, and to
            eat part of such victuals as our companions had left them when they were turned ashore.
            Then he told me that for the kindness I had showed to his countrymen he gave us all our
            Hves and liberties, which other- wise he would certainly have taken from us. And, though
            he could scarcely be persuaded in his mind to spare the Indians' lives, yet for my sake
            he pardoned them all, and I should have them with me in case I could find them. Thus he
            bid me like- wise take my canoe, and go in God's name, saying withal he wished us as
            fortunate as we were generous. Hereupon I took my leave of him, after some little stay,
            though he invited me to tarry all night with him. I searched out, and at last found, my
            Indians, who for fear had hid themselves in the bushes adjoining to the neighbouring
            woods where they lay concealed. Having found them, the Captain led me very civilly down
            to the canoe, bidding my companions and the Indians get in after me : as they at first
            hauled us ashore, so now again they pushed us off to sea, by a sudden and strange
            vicissitude of fortune. All that night it rained very hard, as was men- tioned above ;
            neither durst we put ashore any more at any place, it being all along such as by
            mariners is commonly called an " iron coast ". The next morning being come, we sailed,
            and paddled, or rowed, till about ten o'clock. At which time we espied a THEY REJOIN
            THEIR COMPANY 317 canoe making towards us with all speed imaginable. Being come up with
            us, and in view, it proved to be of our own EngHsh Company, who, mistaking our canoe for
            a Spanish periagua, was coming in all haste to attack us. We were infinitely glad to
            meet them, and they presently conducted us to the rest of our company, who were at that
            instant coming from a deep bay which lay behind a high point of rocks, where they had
            lain at anchor all that night and morning. We were all mutually rejoiced to see one
            another again, they having given both me and my companions up for lost. CHAPTER VI The
            Buccaneers prosecute their voyage, till they come within sight of Panama. They take
            several harks and prisoners by the way. Are descried by the Spaniards before their
            arrival. They order the Indians to kill the prisoners From the place where we rejoined
            our -EngHsh forces we all made our way towards a high hummock of land, as it appeared at
            a distance, but was nothing else than an island seven leagues distant from the bay
            aforementioned. On the highest part of this island the Spaniards keep a watch or '
            look-out ' (for so it is termed by the seamen) for fear of pirates or other enemies.
            That evening we arrived at the island, and, being landed, went up a very steep place
            till we came to a little hut where the watchman lodged. We took by surprizal the old man
            who watched in the place but happened not to see us till we were got into his plantain
            walk before the lodge. He told us in his examination that we were not as yet descried by
            the Spaniards of Panama or any others that he knew, which relation of the old fellow
            much encouraged us to go forwards with our design of surprising that rich city. This
            place, if I took its name rightly, is called Parol de Plantanos, or, in English,
            Plantain-Watch. Here, not long before it was dark that evening, a certain bark came to
            an anchor at the outward side of the island which instantly was descried by us. Hereupon
            we speedily manned out two canoes, who went under the shore and surprised the said boat.
            Having examined the persons that were on board, we found she had been absent the space
            of eight days from Panama, and had landed soldiers at a point of land not far distant
            from this island, with intention to fight and curb certain Indians and negroes who had
            done much hurt in the country thereabouts. The bark being taken, most of 318 VOYAGE TO
            PANAMA CONTINUED 319 our men endeavoured to get into her, but more especially those who
            had the lesser canoes. Thus there embarked thereon to the number of 137 of our company,
            together with that sea-artist and valiant commander, Captain Bartholomew Sharp. Witli
            him went also on board Captain Cook, whom we mentioned at the beginning of this history.
            The remaining part of that night we lay at the quay of the said island, expecting to
            prosecute our voyage the next day. Morning being come, I changed my canoe and embarked
            myself on another, which, though it was something lesser than the former, yet was
            furnished with better company. Departing from the island, we rowed all day long over
            shoal- water, at the distance of about a league from land, having sometimes not above
            four-foot water and white ground. In the afternoon we descried a bark at sea, and
            instantly gave her chase. But the canoe wherein was Captain Harris happened to come up
            the first with her, who, after a sharp dispute, took her. Being taken, we put on board
            the saSH bark 30 men. But the wind would not suffer the other bark, in chasing, to come
            up with us. This pursuit of the vessel did so far hinder us in our voyage, and divide us
            asunder, that, night soon coming on, we lost one another and could no longer keep in a
            body together. Hereupon we laid our canoe ashore, to take up our rest for that night at
            the distance of two miles, more or less, from high-water mark, and about four leagues to
            leeward of the island of Chepillo, to which place our course was then directed. The next
            morning, as soon as the water began to float us, we rowed away for the forementioned
            island Chepillo, where by assignation our general rendezvous was to be. On our way as we
            went, we spied another bark under sail, as we had done the day before. Captain Coxon's
            canoe was now the first that came up with this vessel. But, a young breeze freshening at
            that instant, she got away from him after the first onset, killing in the said canoe one
            Mr Bull and wounding two others. We presently conjectured that this bark would get
            before us to Panama, and give intelligence of our coming to those of the town ; all
            which happened as we had fore- seen. It was two o'clock in the afternoon before all our
            canoes could come together and join one another, as it was assigned at Chepillo. We took
            at that island fourteen prisoners, 320 THE PRISONERS ESCAPE between negroes and mulattos
            ; also great store of plantains and good water, together with two fat hogs. But now, be-
            lieving that ere this we had been already descried at Panama by the bark aforementioned,
            we resolved among ourselves to waste no time, but to hasten away from the said island,
            to the intent we might at least be able to surprise and take their shipping, and by that
            means make ourselves masters of those seas, in case we could not get the town which now
            we judged almost impossible to be done. At Chepillo we took also a periagua which we
            found at anchor before the island, and presently we put some men on board her. Our stay
            here was only of few hours, so that about four o'clock in the evening, which now was
            coming on, we rowed away, designing to reach Panama before the next morning, to which
            place we had now only seven leagues to go, it being no farther distant from Chepillo.
            But, before we departed from the said island, it was judged convenient by our
            Commanders, for certain reasons which I could not dive into, to rid their hands of the
            prisoners which we had taken. And hereupon orders were given unto our Indians, who they
            knew would perform them very willingly, to fight, or rather to murder and slay, the said
            prisoners upon the shore, and that in view of the whole fleet. This they instantly went
            about to do, being glad of this opportunity to revenge their hatred against their
            enemies, though in cold blood. But the prisoners, although they had no arms wherewith to
            defend themselves, forced their way through those barbarous Indians, in spite of their
            lances, bows, and arrows, and got into the woods of the island, only one man of them
            being killed. We rowed all night long, though many showers of rain ceased not to fall.
            CHAPTER VII They arrive within sight of Panama. Are encountered by three small
            men-of-war. They fight them with only 68 fnen, and utterly defeat them, taking two of
            the said vessels. Description of that bloody fight. They take several ships at the isle
            of Perico before Panama The next morning, which was on April 23rd, 1680, that day being
            dedicated to St George, our Patron of England, we came before sunrise within view of the
            city of Panama, which makes a pleasant show to the vessels that are at sea from off the
            shore. Soon after we saw also the ships belonging to the said city which lay at anchor
            at an island called Perico, distant only two leagues from Panama. On the aforesaid
            island are to be seen several storehouses which are built there, to receive the goods
            dehvered out of the ships. At that present there lode at anchor at Perico five great
            ships and three pretty big barks, called Barcos de la Armadilla, or little men-of-war ;
            the word Armadilla signifying a Little Fleet. These had been suddenly manned with design
            to fight us, and prevent any further attempts we should make upon the city or coasts of
            those seas. As soon as they spied us, they instantly weighed anchor and got under sail,
            coming directly to meet us whom they expected very shortly, accord- ing to the
            intelligence they had received of our coming. Our two periaguas being heavy could not
            row so fast as we that were in the canoes, and hence we were got pretty far before them.
            In our five canoes (for so many we were now in com- pany) we had only 36 men, in a very
            unfit condition to fight, being tired with so much rowing, and so few in number in
            comparison with the enemy that came against us. They sailed towards us directly before
            the wind, insomuch that we feared lest they should run us down before it. Hereupon we
            rowed Y 321 322 THE ENGAGEMENT up into the wind's eye, as the seamen term it, and got
            close to windward of them. While we were doing this, our lesser periaguas, in which were
            32 or more of our company, came up with us. So that we were in all 68 men that were
            engaged in the fight of that day, the King himself, who was in the periagua
            aforementioned, being one of our number. In the vessel that was admiral of these three
            small men-of-war were fourscore and six Biscayners, who have the repute of being the
            best mariners and also the best soldiers amongst the Spaniards. These were all
            volunteers, who came designedly to show their valour, under the command of Don Jacinto
            de Barahona, who was High Admiral of those seas. In the second were 77 negroes, who were
            commanded by an old and stout Spaniard, a native of Andalusia in Spain, named Don
            Francisco de Peralta. In the third and last were 65 mestizos or mulattos or tawnymores,
            commanded by Don Diego de Carabaxal. So that in all they made the number of 228 men. The
            Commanders had strict orders given them, and their resolution was to give quarter to
            none of the Pirates or Buccaneers. But such bloody commands as these seldom or never do
            happen to prosper. The canoe of Captain Sawkins, and also that wherein I was, were much
            to leeward of the rest ; so that the ship of Don Diego de Carabaxal came between us two,
            and fired presently on me to windward, and on him to leeward, wound- ing with these
            broadsides four men in his canoe and one in that I was in ; but he paid so dear for his
            passage between us that he was not very quick in coming about again and making the same
            way. For we killed with our first volley of shot several of his men upon the decks. Thus
            we also got to windward, as the rest were before. At this time the Admiral of the
            Armadilla, or Little Fleet, came up with us suddenly, scarce giving us time to charge,
            and thinking to pass by us all with as little or less damage as the first of his ships
            had done. But, as it happened, it fell out much worse with him, for we were so fortunate
            as to kill the man at the helm, so that his ship ran into the wind, and her sails lay
            a-back, as is usually said in marinery. By this means we had time to come all up under
            his stern, and, firing continually into his vessel, we killed as many as came to the
            helm, besides which slaughter we cut asunder his main sheet and brace with THE
            ENGAGEMENT 323 our shot. At this time the third vessel, in which Captain Peralta was,
            was coming up to the aid of their general. Here- upon Captain Sawkins, who had changed
            his canoe and was gone into the periagiia, left the Admiral to us four canoes (for his
            own was quite disabled) and met the said Peralta. Between him and Captain Sawkins the
            dispute, or fight, was very hot, lying board on board together, and both giving and
            receiving death unto each other as fast as they could charge. While we were thus
            engaged, the first ship tacked about, and came up to relieve the Admiral. But we,
            perceiving that and fore- seeing how hard it would go with us if we should be beaten
            from the Admiral's stern, determined to prevent his design. Hereupon two of our canoes,
            to wit Captain Springer's and my own, stood off to meet him. He made up directly towards
            the Admiral, who stood upon the quarter-deck waving to him with a handkerchief so to do.
            But we engaged him so closely in the middle of his way, that had he not given us the
            helm and made away from us, we had certainly been on board him. We killed so many of
            them that the vessel had scarce men enough left alive or unwounded to carry her off.
            Yet, the wind now blowing fresh, they made shift to get away from us, and hereby saved
            their lives. The vessel which was to relieve the Admiral being thus put to flight, we
            came about again upon the Admiral, and all together gave a loud halloo, which was
            answered by our men in the periagua, though at a distance from us. At that time we came
            so close under the stern of the Admiral that we wedged up the rudder ; and withal killed
            both the Admiral himself and the chief pilot of his ship, so that now they were almost
            quite disabled and disheartened likewise, seeing what a bloody massacre we had made
            among them with our shot. Hereupon, two-thirds of their men being killed and many others
            wounded, they cried for quarter, which had several times been offered unto them and as
            stoutly denied until then. Captain Coxon entered on board the Admiral, and took with him
            Captain Harris, who had been shot through both his legs, as he boldly adventured up
            along the side of the ship. This vessel being thus taken, we put on board her also all
            the rest of our wounded men, and instantly manned two of our canoes to go and aid
            Captain Sawkins, who now had been three times beaten from on board by Peralta, such
            valiant 324 THE SPANIARDS DEFEATED defence had he made. And indeed, to give our enemies
            their due, no men in the world did ever act more bravely than these Spaniards. Thus
            coming up close under Peralta's side, we gave him a full volley of shot, and expected to
            have the like return from him again, but on a sudden we saw his men blown up that were
            abaft the mast — some of them falling on the deck, and others into the sea. This
            disaster was no sooner perceived by their vahant Captain Peralta than he leaped
            overboard, and, in spite of all our shot, got several of them into the ship again,
            though he was much burnt in both his hands himself. But, as one misfortune seldom comes
            alone, whilst he was recovering these men to reinforce his ship withal and renew the
            fight, another jar of powder took fire forward, and blew up several others upon the
            forecastle. Among this smoke, and under cover thereof. Captain Sawkins laid them on
            board and took the ship. Soon after they were taken, I went on board Captain Peralta, to
            see what condition they were in, and indeed such a miserable sight I never saw in my
            life, for not one man there was found but was either killed, desper- ately wounded, or
            horribly burnt with powder, insomuch that their black skins were turned white in several
            places, the powder having torn it from their flesh and bones. Having compassionated
            their misery, I went afterwards on board the Admiral, to observe hkewise the condition
            of his ship and men. Here I saw what did much astonish me, and will scarcely be believed
            by others than ourselves who saw it. There were found on board this ship but 25 men
            alive, whose number before the fight had been four-score-and-six, as was said above. So
            that three-score-and-one, out of so small a number, were destroyed in the battle. But,
            what is more, of these 25 men only eight were able to bear arms, all the rest being
            desperately wounded, and by their wounds totally disabled to make any resistance or
            defend themselves. Their blood ran down the decks in whole streams, and scarce one place
            in the ship was found that was free from blood. Having possessed ourselves of these two
            Armadilla vessels, or little men-of-war, Captain Sawkins asked the prisoners how many
            men there might be on board the greatest ship that we could see, lying in the harbour of
            the ii,land of Pence above-mentioned, as also in the others that were something THE
            ARMADILLA, OR LITTLE FLEET 325 smaller. Captain Peralta, hearing these questions,
            dissuaded him as much as he could from attempting them, saying that in the biggest alone
            there were 350 men, and that he would find the rest too well provided for defence
            against his small number. But one of his men, who lay a-dying upon the deck,
            contradicted him as he was speaking, and told Captain Sawkins there was not one man on
            board any of those ships that were in view ; for they had all been taken out of them to
            fight us in these three vessels called the Armadilla, or Little Fleet. Unto this
            relation we gave credit, as proceeding from a dying man ; and, steering our course to
            the island, we went on board them, and found, as he had said, not one person there. The
            biggest ship of these, which was called La Santis- sima Trinidad, or The Blessed
            Trinity, they had set on fire, made a hole in her, and loosened her foresail ; but we
            quenched the fire with all speed, and stopped the leak. This being done, we put our
            wounded men on board her, and thus constituted her for the time being our hospital.
            Having surveyed our own loss and damages, we found that 18 of our men had been killed in
            the fight, and 22 were wounded. These three Captains against whom we fought were
            esteemed by the Spaniards to be the valiantest in all the South Seas. Neither was this
            reputation undeservedly conferred upon them, as may easily be inferred from the relation
            we have given of this bloody engagement. As the third ship was running away from the
            fight, she met with two more that were coming out to their assistance, but gave them so
            little encouragement that they returned back and dared not engage us. We began the fight
            about half-an-hour after sunrise, and by noon had finished the battle and quite overcome
            them. Captain Peralta, while he was our prisoner, would often break out in admiration of
            our valour, and say : Surely we Englishmen were the valiantest men in the whole world,
            who designed always to fight open, whilst all other nations invented all the ways
            imaginable to barricade themselves, and fight as close as they could. And yet,
            notwithstanding, we killed more of our enemies than they of us. Two days after our
            engagement, we buried Captain Peter Harris, a brave and stout soldier and a valiant
            Englishman, born in the county of Kent ; whose death we very much lamented. He died of.
            the wounds he received in the battle. 326 BURIAL OF CAPTAIN HARRIS and besides him only
            one man more : all the rest of our wounded men recovered. Being now come before Panama,
            I here inquired of Don Francisco de Peralta, our prisoner, many things concerning the
            state and condition of this city and the neighbouring country, and he satisfied me in
            manner following. CHAPTER VIII Descriptiofi of the state and condition of Panama, and
            the parts adjacent. What vessels they took while they blocked up the said Port. Captain
            Coxon with 70 more return home. Sawkins is chosen in chief The famous city of Panama is
            situated in the latitude of 9 degrees North. It stands in a deep bay, belonging to the
            South Sea. It is in form round, excepting only that part where it runs along the
            sea-side. Formerly it stood four miles more to the East, when it was taken by Sir Henry
            Morgan, as is related in the History of the Buccaneers. But then, being burnt, and three
            times more since that time by casualty, they removed it to the place where it now
            stands. Yet, notwithstanding, there are some poor people still in- habiting the old
            town, and the cathedral church is still kept there, the beautiful building whereof makes
            a fair show at a distance, like that of St Paul's in London. This new city of which I
            now speak is much bigger than the old one, and is built for the most part of brick, the
            rest being of stone, and tiled. As for the churches belonging thereto, they are not as
            yet finished. These are eight in number, whereof the chief is called Santa Maria. The
            extent of the city comprehends better than a mile-and-a-half in length, and above a mile
            in breadth. The houses for the most part are three stories in height. It is well walled
            round about, with two gates belonging thereto, excepting only where a creek comes into
            the city, the which at high-water lets in barks, to furnish the inhabitants with all
            sorts of provisions and other necessaries. Here are always 300 of the King's soldiers to
            garrison the city ; besides which number, their mihtia, of all colours, are 1 100. But,
            at the time that we arrived there, most of their soldiers were out of town, insomuch
            that our coming put the 327 32 8 THE CITY OF PANAMA rest into great consternation, they
            having had but one night's notice of our being in those seas. Hence we were induced to
            beUeve that, had we gone ashore instead of fighting their ships, we had certainly
            rendered ourselves masters of the place ; especially considering that all their chief
            men were on board the Admiral — I mean such as were undoubtedly the best soldiers. Round
            about the city, for the space of seven leagues, more or less, all the adjacent country
            is Savanna, as they call it in the Spanish language, that is to say, plain and level
            ground, as smooth as a sheet, for this is the signification of the word Savanna. Only
            here and there is to be seen a small spot of woody land, and everywhere this level
            ground is full of vacadas or heef stantions^, where whole droves of cows and oxen are
            kept, which serve as well as so many look-outs, or watch-towers, to descry if an enemy
            is approach- ing by land. The ground whereon the city stands is very damp and moist,
            which renders the place of bad repute for the concern of health. The water is also very
            full of worms, and these are much prejudicial to shipping ; which is the cause that the
            King's ships lie always at Lima, the capital city of Peru, unless when they come down to
            Panama to bring the King's plate, which is only at such times as the fleet of galleons
            comes from Old Spain to fetch and convey it thither. Here, in one night after our
            arrival, we found worms of three-quarters of an inch in length, both in our bedclothes
            and other apparel. At the island of Perico above-mentioned we seized in all five ships ;
            of these, the first and biggest was named, as was said before, the Trinidad, and was a
            great ship, of the burden of 400 tons. Her lading consisted of wine, sugar, sweetmeats
            (whereof the Spaniards in those hot countries make infinite use), skins, and soap. The
            second ship was of about 300 tons burden, and not above half laden with bars of iron,
            which is one of the richest commodities that are brought into the South Sea. This vessel
            we burnt with the lading in her, because the Spaniards pretended not to want that com-
            modity, and therefore would not redeem it. The third was laden with sugar, being of the
            burden of one-hundred and four-score tons, more or less. This vessel was given to be
            under the command of Captain Cook. The fourth was an ^ Spanish estancia, a dwelling, '
            station ' for cattle. WITHDRAWAL OF CAPT. COXON 329 old ship of sixty tons burden, which
            was laden with flour of meal. This ship we likewise burnt with her lading, esteeming
            both bottom and cargo at that time to be useless to us. The fifth was a ship of 50 tons,
            which, with a periagua, Captain Coxon took along with him when he left us. Within two or
            three days after our arrival at Panama, Captain Coxon being much dissatisfied with some
            reflections which had been made upon him by our company, determined to leave us and
            return back to our ships in the Northern Seas by the same way he came thither. Unto this
            effect he persuaded several of our company, who sided most with him and had had the
            chief hand in his election, to fall off from us, and bear him company in his journey or
            march overland. The main cause of those reflections was his back- wardness in the last
            engagement with the A rmadilla, concern- ing which point some sticked not to defame, or
            brand, him with the note of cowardice. He drew off with him threescore- and-ten of our
            men, who all returned back with him in the ship and periagua above-mentioned towards the
            mouth of the river of Santa Maria. In his company also went back the Indian King,
            Captain Antonio, and Don Andraeas, who, being old, desired to be excused from staying
            any' longer with us. However, the King desired we would not be less vigorous in annoying
            their enemy and ours, the Spaniards, than if he were personally present with us. And, to
            the intent we might see how faithfully he intended to deal with us, he at the same time
            recommended both his son and nephew to the care of Captain Sawkins, who was now our
            newly-chosen General or Commander-in-Chief in the absence of Captain Sharp. The two
            Armadilla ships which we took in the engagement we burnt also, saving no other thing of
            them both but their rigging and sails. With them also we burnt a small bark which came
            into the port laden with fowls and poultry. On Sunday, which was April 25th, Captain
            Sharp with his bark and company came in and joined us again. His absence was occasioned
            by want of water, which forced him to bear up to the King's Islands. Being there, he
            found a new bark, which he at once took, and burnt his old one. This vessel did sail
            excellently well. Within a day or two after the arrival of Captain Sharp came in
            likewise the people of Captain Harris who were still absent. These had also taken 330
            THE ISLAND OF TAVOGA another bark, and cut down the masts of their old one by the board,
            and thus without masts or sails turned away the prisoners they had taken in her. The
            next day we took in like manner another bark which arrived from Nata, being laden with
            fowls, as before. In this bark we turned away all the meanest of the prisoners we had on
            board us. Having continued before Panama for the space of ten days, being employed in
            the affairs aforementioned, on May 2nd we weighed from the island of Perico, and stood
            off to another island, distant two leagues farther from thence, called Tavoga. On this
            island stands a town which bears the same name, and consists of a hundred houses, more
            or less. The people of the town had all fled on seeing our vessels arrive. While we were
            here, some of our men being drunk on shore happened to set fire to one of the houses ;
            which consum.ed twelve houses more before any could get ashore to quench it. To this
            island came several Spanish merchants from Panama, and sold us what commodities we
            needed, buying also of us much of the goods we had taken in their own vessels. They gave
            us likewise 200 pieces-of-eight for each negro we could spare them of such as were our
            prisoners. From this island we could easily see all the vessels that went out or came
            into the Port of Panama ; and here we took likewise several barks that were laden with
            fowls. Eight days after our arrival at Tavoga we took a ship that was coming from
            Truxillo and bound for Panama. In this vessel we found 2000 jars of wine, 50 jars of
            gunpowder, and 51,000 pieces-of-eight. This money had been sent from that city to pay
            the soldiers belonging to the garrison of Panama. From the said prize we had information
            given us that there was another ship coming from Lima with 100,000 pieces-of-eight more
            ; which ship was to sail ten or twelve days after them, and which they said could not be
            long before she arrived at Panama. Within two days after this intelligence we took also
            another ship laden with flour from Truxillo, belonging to certain Indians, inhabitants
            of the same place or thereabouts. This prize confirmed what the first had told us of
            that rich ship, and said, as the others had done before, that she would be there in the
            space of eight or ten days. Whilst we lay at Tavoga, the President, that is to say the
            CAPT. SAWKINS' MESSAGE 331 Governor, of Panama, sent a message by some merchants to us
            to know what we came for into those parts. To this message Captain Sawkins made answer :
            That we came to assist the King of Darien, who was the true Lord of Panama and all the
            country thereabouts. And thai since we were come so far, there was no reason hut that we
            should have some satis- faction. So that if he pleased to send us 500 pieces-of-eight
            for each man, and 1000 for each Commander, and not any farther to annoy the Indians hut
            suffer them to use their own power and liberty as became the true and natural lords of
            the country, that then we would desist from all further hostilities and go away
            peaceably : otherwise, that we should stay there, and get what we could, causing to them
            what damage was possible. By the merchants also that went and came to Panama we under-
            stood there lived then as Bishop of Panama one who had been formerly Bishop of Santa
            Martha, and who was prisoner to Captain Sawkins when he took the said place about four
            or five years past. The Captain having received this intelli- gence, sent two loaves of
            sugar to the Bishop as a present. On the next day the merchant who carried them,
            returning to Tavoga, brought to the Captain a gold ring for a retaliation of said
            present. And withal he brought a message to Captain Sawkins from the President
            above-mentioned, to know farther of him, since we were EngHshmen, from whom we had our
            commission, and to whom he ought to complain for the damages we had already done them.
            To this message Captain Sawkins sent back for answer : That as yet all his company were
            not come together ; hut that when they were come up we would come and visit him at
            Panama, and bring our commissions on the muzzles of our guns, at which time he should
            read them as plain as the flame of gunpowder could make them. At this island of Tavoga
            Captain Sawkins would fain have stayed longer, to wait for the rich ship above-mentioned
            that was coming from Peru ; but our men were so importunate for fresh victuals that no
            reason could rule them, nor their own interest persuade them to anything that might
            conduce to this purpose. Hereupon, on May 15th, we weighed anchor, and sailed thence to
            the island of Otoque. Being arrived there, we lay by it while our boat went ashore and
            fetched off fowls and hogs and other things necessary for sustenance. Here at Otoque I
            finished a draft from point Garachine to 332 THE BAY OF PANAMA the bay of Panama, etc.
            Of this I may dare to affirm that it is in general more correct and true than any the
            Spaniards have themselves, for which cause I have here inserted it, for the satisfaction
            of those that are curious in such things. From Otoque we sailed to the island of Cayboa,
            which is a place very famous for the pearl-fishery thereabouts, and is at the distance
            of eight leagues from another place called Puebla Nueva, on the mainland. In our way to
            this island we lost two of our barks, the one whereof had fifteen men in her, and the
            other seven. Being arrived, we cast anchor at the said island. (zr£^a^^^, B*Olarirt

            Buccaneers, is killed before Puchla Nueua. They are repulsed from the said place.
            Captain Sharp chosen to be their leader. Many more of their company leave them and
            return home overland While we lay at anchor before Cayboa our two Chief Com- manders,
            Captain Sawkins and Captain Sharp, taking with them threescore men, more or less, went
            in the ship of Captain Cook to the mouth of the river where Puebla Nueva is situated.
            The day of this action, as I find it quoted in my Journal, was May 22nd, 1679. When they
            came to the river's mouth, they put themselves into canoes, and were piloted up the
            river towards the town by a negro who was one of our prisoners. I was chosen to be
            concerned in this action, but happened not to land, being commanded to remain in Captain
            Cook's ship while they went up to assault the town. But here at Puebla Nueva the
            inhabitants were too well prepared for the reception of our party. For a distance of a
            mile below the town they had cut down great trees and laid them across the river, with
            design to hinder the ascent of any boats. In like manner on shore before the town itself
            they had raised three strong breastworks, and made other things for their defence. Here,
            therefore, Captain Sawkins, running up to the breastworks at the head of a few men, was
            killed : a man who was as valiant and courageous as any could be, and likewise, next to
            Captain Sharp, the best beloved of all our company or the most part thereof. Neither was
            this love undeserved by him, for we ought justly to attribute to him the greatest honour
            we gained in our engagement before Panama with the Spanish Armadilla, or lAttle Fleet,
            especially, considering that, as has been said above, Captain 333 334 MORE BUCCANEERS
            WITHDRAW Sharp was by accident absent at the time of that great and bloody fight. We
            that remained behind on board the ship of Captain Cook carried her within the mouth of
            the river of Puebla Nueva, and entered close by the East shore, which here is crowned
            with a round hill. Here within two stone's cast of shore we had four fathom water.
            Within the point opens a very large and fine river, which falls from a sandy bay at a
            small distance thence. But, as we were getting in, being strangers to the place we
            unwittingly ran our ship aground, nigh to a rock which lies on the Westward shore : for
            the true channel of the said river is nearer to the East than the West shore. With
            Captain Sawkins, in the unfortunate assault of this place, there died two men more, and
            three were wounded in the retreat, which they performed to the canoes in pretty good
            order. On their way down the river Captain Sharp took a ship, whose lading consisted of
            indigo, otto, manteca, or butter, and pitch, and likewise burnt two vessels more, as
            being of no value. With this he returned on board our ships, much troubled in his mind,
            and grieved for the loss of so bold and brave a partner in his adventures as Sawkins had
            constantly shown himself to be. His death was much lamented, and occasioned another
            party of our men to mutiny and leave us, returning overland as Captain Coxon and his
            company had done before. Three days after the death of Captain Sawkins, Captain Sharp,
            who was now Commander-in-Chief, gave the ship which he had taken in the river of Puebla
            Nueva, which was of the burden of one hundred tons, more or less, to Captain Cook, to
            command and sail in — ordering withal that the old vessel which he had should go with
            those men that designed to leave us, their mutiny and our distraction being now grown
            very high. Hereupon Captain Sharp coming on board La Trinidad, the greatest of our
            ships, asked our men in full council who of them were wilUng to go or stay, and
            prosecute the design Captain Sawkins had undertaken, which was to remain in the South
            Sea and there to make a complete voyage ; after which, he intended to go home round
            about America, through the Strait of Magellan. He added withal that he did not as yet
            fear, or doubt in the least, but to make each man who should stay with him worth one
            thousand pounds MORE BUCCANEERS WITHDRAW 335 by the fruits he hoped to reap of that
            voyage. All those who had remained after the departure of Captain Coxon, for love of
            Captain Sawkins and only to be in his company and under his conduct, thinking thereby to
            make their fortunes, would stay no longer, but pressed to depart. Among this number I
            acknowledge myself to have been one, being totally desirous in my mind to quit those
            hazardous adven- tures, and return homewards with those who were now going to leave us.
            Yet, being much afraid and averse to trust myself among wild Indians any farther, I
            chose rather to stay, though unwilHng, and venture on that long and danger- ous voyage.
            Besides which danger of the Indians, I con- sidered that the rains were now already up,
            and it would be hard passing so many guUies, which of necessity would then be full of
            water and consequently create more than one single peril to the undertakers of that
            journey. Yet, not- withstanding, 63 men of our company were resolved to encounter all
            these hardships, and to depart from us. Here- unto they took their leave of us, and
            returned homewards, taking with them the Indian King's son and the rest of the Indians
            for their guides overland. They had, as was said above, the ship wherein Captain Cook
            sailed to carry them, and out of our provisions as much as would serve for treble their
            number. Thus on the last day of May they departed, leaving us employed about taking in
            water and cutting down wood at the island of Cayboa aforementioned, where this mutiny
            happened. Here we caught very good tortoises and red-deer. We killed also alligators of
            a very large size, some of them being above twenty-feet in length. But we could not find
            but that they were very fearful of a man, and would fly from us very hastily when we
            hunted them. This island hes S.S.E. from the mouth of the river above-mentioned. On the
            South-east side of the island is a shoal, or spit, of sand, which stretches itself the
            space of a quarter-of-a-league into the sea. Here, therefore, just within this shoal, we
            anchored in fourteen fathom water. The island on this side thereof makes two great bays,
            in the first of which we watered at a certain pond not distant above the cast of a stone
            from the bay. In this pond, as I was washing myself and standing under a man- Manilla
            tree, a small shower of rain happened to fall on the 33^ TORTOISES; RED-DEER; OYSTERS
            tree, and thence dropped on my skin. These drops caused me to break out all over my body
            into red spots, of which I was not well for the space of a week after. Here I ate very
            large oysters, the biggest that ever I ate in my life, insomuch that I was forced to cut
            them into four pieces, each quarter of them being a good mouthful i. Three days after
            the departure of the mutineers Captain Sharp ordered us to burn the ship that they
            hitherto had sailed in, only out of design to make use of the ironwork belonging to the
            said vessel. Withal, we put all the flour that was her lading into the last prize, taken
            in the river of Puebla Nueva, and Captain Cook, as was said before, was ordered to
            command her. But the men belonging to his company would not sail any longer under his
            command. Hereupon he quitted his vessel and came on board our Admiral, the great ship
            above-mentioned, called La Trinidad, deter- mining to rule over such unruly company no
            longer. In his place was put one whose name was John Cox, an inhabitant of New England,
            who forced kindred, as was thought, upon Captain Sharp, out of old acquaintance, in this
            conjuncture of time, only to advance himself. Thus he was made, as it were, Vice-Admiral
            to Captain Sharp. The next day three of our prisoners, viz. an Indian, who was Captain
            of a ship, and two mulattos ran away from us, and made their escape. After this it was
            thought convenient to send Captain Peralta prisoner in the Admiral, on board the ship of
            Mr Cox. This was done to the intent he might not hinder the endeavours of Captain Juan,
            who was Commander of the money-ship we took, as was mentioned, at the island of Tavoga.
            For this man had now promised to do great things for us, by piloting and conducting us
            to several places of great riches, but more especially to Guayaquil, where he said we
            might lay down our silver and lade our vessels with gold. This design was undertaken by
            Captain Sawkins, and had not the head-strongness of his men brought him to the island of
            Cay boa, where he lost his life, he had certainly effected it before now. That night we
            had such thunder and lightning as I never had heard before in all my hfe. Our prisoners
            ^ It does not seem to occur to the writer that his ' red spots ' were more probably due
            to the oysters than to the rain ! THUNDER AND LIGHTNING 337 told us that in these parts
            it very often causes great damages both by sea and land. And my opinion led me to
            believe that our mainmast received some damage on this occasion. The rainy season being
            now entered, the wind for the most part was at N.W., though not without some calms.
            CHAPTER X They depart from the island of Cayhoa to the isle of Gorgona, where they
            careen their vessels. Description of this isle. They resolve to go and plunder Arica,
            leaving their design of Guayaquil Having got in all things necessary for navigation, we
            were now in readiness to depart on Sunday, June 6th, 1680. That day some rain fell,
            which now was very frequent in all places. About five o'clock in the evening we set sail
            from the island of Cayboa, with a small breeze, the wind being at S.S.W. Our course was
            E.S. by E. and S.E. having all night a very small, or little, wind. The same calmness of
            weather con- tinued all the next day, insomuch, that we lay and drove only as the
            current horsed us to N.W. Little better than a calm we had also the third day of our
            navigation. Meanwhile a current drove us to the Westward. About sunrising we descried
            Quicara, which at that time bore N.W. by W. from us at the distance of five leagues,
            more or less. With the rising of the sun an easy gale of wind sprang up, so that at noon
            we had altered our bearing, which was then N. by E. being six leagues distant, and
            appearing thus, as is underneath demonstrated. i Quicara These are two several islands,
            whereof the least is to the Southward of the other. The land is a low table-land, these
            islands being more than three leagues in length. About six o'clock that evening we were
            nigh ten leagues distant W.S.W. from them. Much like the former weather we had the
            fourth 338 TORTOISES; DOLPHINS; FISH 339 day of our sailing, with little wind in the
            forenoon and rather less than more in the afternoon. I judged, about the middle of the
            day, we were at the distance of twenty leagues S.S.W. from the said islands. Thursday,
            June loth, we had very small and variable winds. This day I reckoned that we had made
            hitherto a S. by E. way, and a S. by W. from our departure, being driven by a current,
            according to the observation I made, into lat. 6° 30'. This day we saw many tortoises
            floating upon the sea. Hereupon we hoisted out our boat, and came to one of them, who
            offered not to stir until she was struck, and even then not to sink to the bottom but
            rather to swim away. The sea hereabouts is very full of several sorts of fish, as
            dolphins, bonitos, albicores\ mullets, and old wives^ etc., which came swimming about
            our ship in whole shoals. The next day, which was Friday, we had Ukewise very little
            wind, which was no more than we had all Thursday night, with some showers of rain. That
            day we had an observation which was lat. 6° N. In the evening a fresh wind came up at
            S.W., our course being S.S.E. On Saturday we had in like manner, about seven in the
            morning, a fresh breeze at S. So we stood W.S.W. with cloudy weather, and several
            showers of rain. This day our Spanish prisoners informed us we must not expect any
            settled wind until we came within the latitude of three degrees, for all along the
            Western shore of these seas there is little wind, which is the cause that those ships
            that go from Acapulco to the islands called De las Philipinas, do coast along the shore
            of Cahfornia, until they get into the height of 45 degrees, yea, sometimes of 50 degrees
            latitude. As the wind varied, so we tacked several times, thereby to make the best of
            our way that was possible to the Southward. As our prisoners had informed us, so we
            found it by experi- ence. For on the next day, which was Sunday, June 13th, we had very
            little wind, and most commonly none, for the space of twenty-four hours. That day we
            tried the current ^ Span, albacore, a large species of tunny found in West Indian seas :

            we had much rain, and in the afternoon a small breeze at W., and W.S.W., but mostly at
            W. Yet, notwith- standing all this calmness of weather, the next day in the morning very
            early, by a sudden gale of wind which arose we made shift to split our main top-sail. We
            had all the night before and that day continued and incessant showers of rain, and made
            a S.W. and by S. way ; seeing all along as we went a multitude of dolphins, bonitos, and
            several other sorts of fish floating upon the seas, whereof in the afternoon we caught
            many, the weather being now changed from stormy to calm again — insomuch that we could
            fish as we sailed along, or rather as we lay tumbling in the calm. Tuesday, June 15th,
            the morning continued calm as the day before ; and this day also we saw multitudes of
            fish of several sorts, whereof we caught some for our table, as we were wont to do. By
            an observation which was made this day, we found ourselves to be now in lat. 4° 21'. At
            this time the course of our navigation and our whole design was to go and careen our
            vessels at the islands commonly called by the Spaniards De los Galapagos, that is to say
            ' of the Tortoises ', being so denominated from the infinite number of those animals
            swarming and breeding thereabouts. These islands are situated under the equinoctial Hne
            at the distance of 100 leagues, more or less, from the main continent of America, in the
            South Sea. In the afternoon of this day we had a small breeze to push us forwards. June
            i6th, being Wednesday, we made our way this day, and for the four-and-twenty hours last
            past, E.S.E., with much rain, which ceased not to fall, as in all this voyage, since our
            departure from Cay boa. This day likewise we caught several dolphins and other sorts of
            fish, but in the even- ing we had again a fresh breeze at S. by W., our course being, as
            was just now said, E.S.E. The next day, which was June 17th, about five in the morning
            we descried land, which appeared all along to be very low, and hkewise full of creeks
            and bays. We instantly asked our pilot what land that was before us ; but he rephed he
            knew it not. Hereupon, being doubtful of our condition, we called Mr Cox on board us,
            who brought Captain Peralta with him. This gentleman, being asked, presently told us THE
            ISLAND OF GORGONA 341 the land we saw was the land of Barbacoa, being almost a wild
            country all over. Withal he informed us that to leeward of us, at the distance of ten
            leagues or thereabouts, did lie an island called by the name of Gorgona, which island,
            he said, the Spaniards did shun, and very seldom come nigh to, by reason of the
            incessant and continual rains there falling, scarce one day in the year being dry at
            that place. Captain Sharp, having heard this information of Captain Peralta, judged the
            said island might be the fittest place for our com- pany to careen at, considering that,
            if the Spaniards did not frequent it, we might in all probability lie there undescried,
            and our enemies the Spaniards in the meantime might think that we were gone out of those
            seas. At this time it was that I seriously repented my staying in the South Seas and
            that I did not return homewards in company of them that went before us. For I knew, and
            could easily perceive, that by these delays the Spaniards would gain time and be able to
            send advice of our coming to every port all along the coast, so that we should be
            prevented in all or most of our attempts and designs wheresoever we came. But those of
            our com- pany who had got money by the former prizes of this voyage over-swayed the
            others who had lost all their booty at gambling. Thus we bore away for the island
            aforesaid of Gorgona, and at the distance of six leagues and a half, at S.W.I, observed
            it to make the appearance following. Gorgona LAT, On the mainland over against this
            island of Gorgona we were told by our prisoners that up a great laguna, or lake, is
            seated an Indian town, where they have great quantity of sand-grains of gold. Moreover,
            that, five days' journey up a river belonging to the said laguna, do dwell four Spanish
            superintendents, who have each of them the charge of over- seeing 50 or 60 Indians who
            are employed in gathering that 342 THE ISLAND OF GORGONA gold which slips from the chief
            collectors, or finders, thereof. These are at least threescore and ten or fourscore
            Spaniards, with a great number of slaves belonging to them, who dwell higher up than
            these four superintendents, at a distance of twenty- five or thirty days' journey on the
            said river. That once every year, at a certain season, there comes a vessel from Lima,
            the capital city of Peru, to fetch the gold that here is gathered, and to bring to these
            people such necessaries as they want. By land it is nothing less than six-weeks' travel
            from thence to Lima. The mainland to windward of this island is very low and full of
            rivers. All along the coast it rains most desperately. The island is only 4 leagues
            distant from the continent. While we lay at it, I took the whole circumference thereof,
            which is according to what is here underneath described. Captain Sharp gave to this
            island the name of Sharp's Isle, by reason we careened at this place. We anchored on the
            South side of the island, at the mouth of a very fine river, which there disgorges
            itself into the sea. There belong to this island about thirty rivers and rivulets, which
            all fall from the rocks on the severa,l sides of the island. The whole SNAKES; WHALES;
            GRAMPUSES 343 circumference thereof is about three-leagues-and-a-half, being all high
            and mountainous land, excepting only on that side where we cast anchor. Here therefore
            we moored our ship in the depth of eighteen or twenty fathom water, and began to unrig
            the vessel. But we were four or five days' space before we could get our sails dry so as
            to be able to take them from the >ards, there falling a shower of rain almost every hour
            of the day and night. The mainland to the East of the island, and so stretching
            northward, is extremely high and towering, and perpetually clouded, excepting only at
            the rising of the sun, at which lime the tops of those hills are clear. From the South
            side of this island where we anchored, as was said above, we could see the lowland of
            the main, at least a point thereof which lies nearest to the island. The appearance it
            makes is as it were of trees growing out of the water. Friday, July 2nd, as we were
            heaving down our ship, our mainm.ast happened to crack. Hereupon our carpenters were
            constrained to cut out large fishes, and fish it, as the usual terms of that art do name
            the thing. On the next day after the mischance of our mainmast, we killed a snake which
            had fourteen inches in circumference and eleven feet in length. About the distance of a
            league from this island runs a ledge of rocks, over which the water con- tinually breaks
            — the ledge being about two miles, more or less, in length. Had we anchored but
            half-a-mile more northerly, we had ridden in much smoother water ; for here where we
            were the wind came in upon us in violent gusts. While we were there, from June 30th to
            July 3rd, we had dry weather, which was esteemed as a rarity by the Spaniards, our
            prisoners. And every day we saw whales and grampuses, who would often come and dive
            under our ship. We fired at them several times, but our bullets rebounded from their
            bodies. Our choice and best provisions here were Indian conies, monkeys, snakes,
            oysters, conchs, periwinkles, and a few small turtle, with some other sorts of good
            fish. Here in like manner we caught a sloth, a beast well deserving that name, given it
            by the Spaniards, by whom it is called pereza, from the Latin word pigritia. At this
            island died Josephe Gabriel, a Spaniard, born in Chile, who was to have been our pilot
            to Panama. He was 344 DECISION TO GO TO ARICA the same man who had stolen and married
            the Indian King's daughter, as was mentioned above. He had all along been very true and
            faithful to us in discovering several plots and conspiracies among our prisoners, either
            to get away or destroy us. His death was occasioned by a calenture, or malignant fever,
            which killed him after three days' sickness, having lain two days senseless. During the
            time of our stay at this island we lengthened our topsails, and got up topgallant masts
            ; we made two staysails, and refitted our ship very well. But we wanted provisions
            extremely, as having nothing considerable of any sort but flour and water. Being almost
            ready to depart. Captain Sharp, our Commander, gave us to understand he had changed his
            resolution concerning the design of going to Guayaquil, for he thought it would be in
            vain to go thither considering that in all this time we must of necessity have been
            descried before now. Yet notwith- standing he himself before had persuaded us to stay.
            Being very doubtful among ourselves what course we should take, a certain old man who
            had long time sailed among the Spaniards told us he could carry us to a place called
            Arica, to which town, he said, all the plate was brought down from Potosi, Chiquisaca,
            and several other places within the land, where it was dug out of the mountains and
            mines, and that he doubted not but that we might get there of purchase at least 2000
            pounds every man. For all the plate of the South Sea lay there, as it were, in store,
            being deposited at the said place until such time as the ships did fetch it away. Being
            moved with these reasons, and having deliberated thereupon, we resolved in the end to go
            to the said place. At this island of Gorgona afore-mentioned we likewise took down our
            round- house coach, and all the high carved work belonging to the stern of the ship,
            for, when we took her from the Spaniards before Panama, she was high as any third-rate
            ship in England. CHAPTER XI The Buccaneers depart from the isle of Gorgona, with design
            to plunder Arica. They lose one another by the way. They touch at the Isle of Plate, or
            Drake's Isle, where they meet again. Description of this isle. Some memoirs of Sir
            Francis Drake. An account of this voyage and the coasts all along. They sail as far in a
            fortnight as the Spaniards usually do in three months On Sunday, July 25th, in the
            afternoon, all things being now in readiness for our departure, we set sail, and stood
            away from the island of Gorgona, or Sharp's Isle, with a small breeze which served us at
            N.W. But as the sun went down that day, so our breeze died away by degrees. Yet already
            we could begin to experiment that our ship sailed much better since the taking down of
            her round house and the other alterations which we made in her. The next day about two
            o'clock in the morning we had a land-breeze to help us, which lasted for the space of
            six hours, more or less. So that at noon we found ourselves to be
            five-leagues-and-a-half distant to the South-West from Gorgona. This day the Spaniards,
            our prisoners, told us, in common discourse, that in most part of this lowland coast
            they find three-score fathom water. In the afternoon we had a very strong land-breeze :
            meanwhile we continued making short trips off and in. That night we had much rain for
            the greatest part of the night, which occasioned the next morning, being the third day
            of our navigation, to be very cloudy until ten o'clock. About that hour it cleared up,
            and then we saw the island of Gorgona at E.N.E., being distant about 12 leagues more or
            less from us. We had the wind all this day at S.W., where it continued, seldom varying
            above two points of the compass to the westwards. Night being come, 345 346 DEPARTURE
            FROM GORGONA about two o'clock Captain Sharp ordered me to speak to Cap- tain Cox and
            bid him go about and stand off from the shore, for he feared less Cox should come too
            nigh unto it. But he replied he knew well that he might stand in until two o'clock. The
            next day very early in the morning we saw him not, the morning being cloudy and stark
            calm. Yet notwithstanding at eight o'clock it cleared up, and neither then could we see
            him. Hence we concluded, and so it proved, that we had lost him in the obscurity of the
            night, through his obstinacy in standing in too long and not coming about when we spoke
            to him. Thus our Admiral's ship was left alone, and we had not the company of Captain
            Cox any longer in this voyage, till we arrived at the Isle of Plate, where we had the
            good fortune to find him again, as shall be mentioned hereafter. The weather being clear
            this morning, we could see Gorgona, at a distance of at least 15 or 16 leagues to the
            E.N.E. All this day it continued calm till about four in the afternoon, at which time we
            had a W.S.W. wind, which continued to blow all that night. Thursday, July 29th, 1679,
            This day the wind continued pretty fresh all day long. About four in the afternoon we
            came within sight of the island Del Gallo, which I guessed to be nigh 28 leagues distant
            from that of Gorgona, the place of our departure S.W. It is about nine leagues distant
            E. from the main ; so that the island with the mainland S.W. from it appears thus : —
            Gallo LAT. 2. 12. N. All this day the weather continued clear, and the wind W.S.W. The
            next day, July 30th, the wind blew very fresh and brisk, insomuch that we were in some
            fear for the heads of our low masts, being very sensible that they were but weak. About
            three or four in the afternoon we saw another island, 6 or 7 leagues distant from Gallo,
            called Gorgonilla. At E. by S. from us it made the appearance which I have here
            adjoined. All the mainland hereabouts lies very low and flat, and is GORGONILLA; GALLO
            347 in very many places overflowed and drowned every high- water. GORGONILLA On
            Saturday, July 31st, in the morning the island Del Gallo, at E.N.E. being distant about
            8 leagues, gave us this appearance : — Gallo. Another Prospect thereof The point of
            Mangroves is a low and level point, running out S.S.W. This day, and the night before
            it, we lost by our computation 3 leagues of our way, which I believe happened because we
            stood out too far from the land, having stood off all night long. August 1st, which was
            Sunday, we had a very fresh wind at W.S.W. This was joined also with several small
            showers of rain which fell that day. In the meanwhile we got pretty well to windward
            with it, by making small trips to and fro, which we performed most commonly, by standing
            in three glasses and as many out. The next day, August 2nd, in the morning, we came up
            into the highland of Santiago, where begins the highland of this coast. We kept at the
            distance of ten leagues from it, making continual short trips, as was mentioned before.
            The next day likewise we continued to do the same. But the weather was cloudy and for
            the most part full of rain. Wednesday, August 4th, we continued still turning in the
            wind'.s eye, as we had done for two days before. This day, in the afternoon, we
            discovered three hills at E.N.E. of our ship. These hills make the land of San Matteo,
            which gives this following appearance : — 348 CAPE OF SAN FRANCISCO San Matteo All the
            coast along hereabouts is highland. That evening also we saw the cape of San Francisco.
            At first this cape appeared like two several islands. But two hours after, at the
            distance of 12 leagues, at S. by W. it looked thus : — Cape of San Francisco Thursday,
            August 5th, we being then about the cape, it looked very like unto Beachy Head in
            England. It is full of white cliffs on all sides. The land turns off here to E. of S.,
            and makes a large and deep bay, the circumference whereof is full of pleasant hills. In
            the bight of the bay are two high and rocky islands, which represent exactly two ships
            with their sails full. We were now come out of the rainy countries into a pleasant and
            fair region, where we had for the most part a clear sky and dry weather. Only now and
            then we could here find a small mist, which soon would vanish away. In the meanwhile
            every night a great dew used to fall, which supplied the defect of rain. The two next
            days following we continued plying to wind- ward with fair weather, nothing else
            remarkable happening in them which might deserve any notice to be taken thereof. On
            Sunday, August 8ch, we came close under a wild and mountainous country. This day
            likewise we saw Cape Passao at the distance of 10 leagues, more or less, to wind- ward
            of us. Ever since we came on this side Mangrove point we had observed a windward current
            did run all along as we sailed. Under shore the land is full of white chffs and groves,
            lower towards the pitch of the cape. The next day we had both a fair day and a fresh
            wind to help us on our voyage. We observed that Cape Passao CAPE PASSAO 349 makes three
            points, between which are two bays. The leeward-most of the two is of the length of 3
            leagues, and the other of 4. Adjoining unto the bays is seen a pleasant valley. Our
            prisoners informed us that northward of these capes live certain Indians, who sell maize
            and other pro- visions to any ships that happen to come in there. The Cape itself is a
            continuous cliff, covered with several sorts of shrubs and low bushes. Under these
            cliffs lies a sandy bay of the depth of 40 feet. The Spaniards say that the wind is
            always here between the S.S.W. and W.S.W. The cape represents with much hkeliness the
            brow of an alligator or cayman. At S. Cape Passao appears thus : — Cape Passao Tuesday,
            August loth. This morning the sky was so thick and hazy that we could not see the
            highland, though it were just before us, and not altogether two leagues distant from us.
            But, as soon as it cleared up, we stood in towards the land until we came within a mile
            of the shore. Here, having sounded, w^e found seven-fathom-and-a-half of water, under
            which was a light and clayey ground. The coast all along is very mountainous and
            likewise full of high and towering cliffs. When we sounded, the tide was almost at
            low-water. Here it ebbs and flows nearly four fathom perpendicular. From this cape the
            land runs along S.E. for the space of three or four leagues, with huge highland cUffs,
            like those of Calais over against England. Being past this cape, the highland S. from us
            is Cape St LawTence. August nth we found ourselves N.N.W. from Monte de Christo, a very
            high and round hill. Thence to windward is seen a very pleasant country, with spots here
            and there of woody land, which cause the country all over to look like so many
            enclosures of ripe cornfields. To leeward of the said hill the land is all high and
            hilly, with white cliffs at the sea- side. The coast runs S.W. till it reaches to a
            point of land 350 CAPE ST LAWRENCE within which is the port of Manta, as it is called.
            This port of Manta is nothing else than a settlement of Spaniards and Indians together
            where ships that want provisions call in and are furnished with several necessaries.
            About 6 or 7 leagues to windward of this port is Cape St Lawrence, butting out into the
            sea, being in form like the top of a church. Monte de Christo gives this appearance at
            sea : — Monte de Christo LAT. 50. 5. The cape rises higher and higher from the port of
            Manta. As we sailed along we saw multitudes of grampuses every day ; also water-snakes
            of divers colours. Both the Spaniards and Indians are very fearful of these snakes,
            believing there is no cure for their bitings. At the distance of eight leagues, or
            thereabouts, to leeward of Cape St Lawrence it appears thus : — Cape St. Lawrence LAT.
            55. S. This day before night we came within sight of Manta. Here we saw the houses of
            the town belonging to the port, which were not above twenty or thirty Indian houses,
            lying under the windward and the mount. We were not willing to be descried by the
            inhabitants of the said place, and stood off to sea again. On Thursday, August 12th, in
            the morning, we saw the Island of Plate at S.W. at the distance of five-leagues, more or
            less. It appeared to us to be an even land. Having made this island, we resolved to go
            thither and refit our rigging, and get some goats which there run wild up and down the
            country. For, as was said before, at this time we had no other provision than Hour and
            water. The island itself is THE ISLE OF PLATE (DRAKE'S ISLE) 351 indifferent highland
            and off at sea looks thus, as is here described : — Isle of Plate LAT. 2. 42. 5. But the
            highland of Cape Passao, of which we have spoken before, at the distance of 15 leagues
            to N., gives in several hummocks this appearance : — Highland of Cape Passao The land of
            Cape St Lawrence is all white cliffs, the head of the cape running N. and S. This day
            several great whales came up to us, and dived under our ship. One of these whales
            followed our ship from two in the afternoon till dark night. The next morning very
            early, at about six o'clock, we came under the aforesaid Isle of Plate, and here
            unexpectedly, to our great joy, we found at anchor the ship of Captain Cox with his
            whole company, whom we had lost at sea for the space of a whole fortnight before. We
            found they had reached this island, and had been there at anchor four days before us,
            being now just ready to depart thence. At about seven we came to anchor, and then the
            other vessel sent us a live tortoise and a goat to feast upon that day, telling us
            withal of great store of tortoises to be found ashore upon the bays and of much fish to
            be caught hereabouts. The island is very steep on all sides, insomuch that there is
            landing only on the N.E. side thereof, where is a gully, nigh unto which we anchored in
            12 fathom water. Here at the distance of a furlong, or little more, from the shore as
            you go to land, you will see on the left hill a cross still standing there erected in
            former times. No trees are to be found on the whole island, but only low shrubs, on
            which the goats feed, which cattle is here very numerous. The shore is bold and hard,
            neither is there any water to be found upon it, excepting i,Si THE ISLE OF PLATE
            (DRAKE'S ISLE) only on the S.W. side of the island, where it cannot be come at, lying so
            much enclosed by the rocks and too great a sea hindering the approach to it in boats.
            This island received its name from Sir Francis Drake and his famous actions, for here it
            is reported by tradition that he made the dividend, or sharing, of that quantity of
            plate which he took in the Armada of this sea, distributing it to each man of his
            company by whole bowls full. The Spaniards afhrm to this day that he took at that time
            twelve-score tons of plate and i6 bowls of coined money a man, his number then being 45
            men in all — insomuch that they were forced to heave much of it overboard, because his
            ship could not carry it all. Hence was this island called by the Spaniards themselves
            the Isle of Plate, from this great dividend ; and by us Drake's Isle. All along as we
            sailed we found the Spanish pilots to be very ignorant of the coasts. But they plead
            thus much for their ignorance, that the merchants, their employers, either of Mexico,
            Lima, Panama, or other parts, will not entrust one pennyworth of goods on that man's
            vessel that corks her, for fear she should miscarry. Here our prisoners told us Uke-
            wise that in the time of Oliver Cromwell, or the Commonwealth of England, a certain ship
            was fitted out of Lima with 70 brass guns, having on board her no less than thirty
            millions of dollars, or pieces-of-eight, all which vast sum of money was given by the
            merchants of Lima, and sent as a present to our gracious King (or rather his father) who
            now reigneth, to supply him in his exile and distress ; but that this great and rich
            ship was lost by keeping along the shore in the Bay of Manta above-mentioned, or
            thereabouts. What truth there may be in this history I cannot easily tell : at least it
            seems to me as scarce deserving any credit. At this island we took out of Mr Cox's ship
            the old Moor (for of that nation he was) who pretended he would be our pilot to Arica.
            This was done lest we should have the mis- fortune of losing the company of Cox's
            vessel, as we had done before, our ship being the biggest in burden and having the
            greatest number of men. Captain Peralta admired oftentimes that we were got so far to
            windward in so little space of time ; whereas they had been, he said, many times three
            or four months in reaching to this distance from our WILD-GOATS; TORTOISES 353
            departure. Their long and tedious voyages, he added, were occasioned by their keeping at
            too great a distance from the shore. Moreover, he told us, that had we gone to the
            islands of Galapagos, as we were once determined to do, we had met in that voyage with
            many calms and such currents that many ships have by them been lost and never heard of
            to this day. This Island of Plate is about two-leagues in length, and very full of both
            deep and dangerous bays, as also such as we call gullies in these parts. The
            circumference and description of the said island is exactly thus : — ^-^''Wi^. We caught
            at this island and salted good number of goats and tortoises. One man standing here on a
            little bay in one day turned 17 tortoises, besides which number our mosquito- strikers
            brought us in several more. Captain Sharp, our Commander, showed himbclf very ingenious
            in striking them, he performhig it as well as the tortoise-strikers themselves. For
            these creatures here are so little fearful that they offer not to sink from the
            fisherm.en, but lie still until such time as they are struck. But we found that the
            tortoises on this side were not so large, nor so sweet to the taste, as those on the
            North side of the island. Of goats we have taken, killed, and salted, above 100 in a
            day, and that without any labour. While we stayed here we made a square maintopsail
            yard. We cut also six feet off our bowsprit, and three feet more off our head. Most of
            the time that we remained here we had hazy weather. Only now and then the sun would
            happen to break out, and then to shine so hot that it burnt the skin off the necks of
            several of our men. As for me, my Hps were burnt in such a manner that they were not
            well in a whole week afterwards. 2 A CHAPTER XII Captain Sharp and his company depart
            from the Isle of Plate in prosecution of their voyage towards Arica. They take two
            Spanish vessels by the way, and learn intelligence from the enemy. Eight of their
            company destroyed at the Isle of Gallo. Tediousness of this voyage, and great hardships
            they endured. Description of the coast all along, and their sailings Having taken in at
            the isle of Plate what provisions and other necessaries we could get, we set sail thence
            on Tuesday, August 17th, 1679, in prosecution of our voyage and designs
            above-mtntioiied, to take and plunder the vastly rich town of Arica. This day we sailed
            so well, and the same we did for several others afterwards, that we were forced to lie
            by several times, besides reefing our topsails, to keep our other ship company, lest we
            should lose her again. The next morning, about break of day, we found ourselves to be at
            the distance of 7 or 8 leagues to the Westward of the island whence we had departed,
            standing W. by S. with a S. by W. wind. About noon that day we had laid the land. After
            dinner the wind came S.S.W. at which time we were forced to stay more than once for the
            other vessel belonging to our company. On the following day we continued in like manner
            a West course all the day long. Sometimes this day the wind would change, but then in a
            quarter-of-an-hour it would return to S.S.W^ again. Hereabouts where we now were we
            observed great ripplings of the sea. August 20th, yesterday in the afternoon about six
            o'clock, we stood in S.E., but all night and all this day, we had very small winds. We
            found still that we gained very much on the small ship, which did not a little both
            perplex and hinder us in our course. 354 THE ISLE OF SOLANGO 3SS The next day likewise
            we stood in S.K. by S., though with very httle wind, which sometimes varied, as was
            mentioned above. That day I finished two quadrants, each of which were
            two-feet-and-a-half radius. Here we had in Uke manner, as has been mentioned on other
            days of our saihngs, very many dolphins, and other sorts of fish swimming about our
            ship. On the morning following we saw again the island of Plate at N.E. of our ship,
            giving us this appearance at that distance of prospect : — Isle of Plate The same day at
            the distance of six-leagues, more or less, from the said island, we saw another island,
            called Solango. This isle lies close in by the mainland. In the evening we observed it
            to bear E.N.E. from us. Our course was S.E. by S. and the wind at S.W. by S. This day
            likewise we found that our lesser ship was still a great hindrance to our saihng, being
            forced to lie by, and stay for her two or three hours every day. We found likewise that,
            the farther from shore we were, the less wind we had all along, and that under the shore
            we were always sure of a fresh gale, though not so favourable to us as we could wish it
            to be. Hitherto we had used to stand off 40 leagues, and yet notwithstanding, in the
            space of six days, we had not got above ten leagues on our voyage, from the place of our
            departure. August 23rd : this day the wind was S.W. by S. and S.S.W. In the morning we
            stood off. The island of Solango, at N.E. by N. appears thus : — IsLS OF Solango As S.
            by W., and about six leagues distance from us, we descried a long and even hill. I took
            it to be an island, and conjectured it might be at least eight leagues distant from the
            continent. But afterwaids we found it was a point of 356 ST HELENA land joining to the
            main, and is called Point St Helena, being continued by a piece of land which lies low,
            and in several places is almost drowned from sight, so that it cannot be seen at two
            leagues distance. In this lowland the Spaniards have conveniences for making pitch, tar,
            , salt, and some other things, for which purpose they have several houses here, and a
            friar who serves them as their chaplain. From the island of Solango to this place are
            reckoned eleven leagues, more or less. The land is hereabouts indifferent high, and is
            likewise full of bays. We had this day very Httle wind to help us in our voyage,
            excepting what blasts came now and then in snatches. These sometimes would prove pretty
            fair to us, and allow us for some little while a South course. But our chief course was
            S.E. by S. The point of St Helena at S. half E. and at about 6 leagues distance gives
            exactly this appearance as follows : — PuNTA DE Santa Helena Here we found no gieat
            current of the sea to move anyway. At the isle of Plata, afore-described, the sea ebbs
            and flows nearly 13 feet perpendicular. About four leagues to leeward of this point is a
            deep bay, having a quay at the mouth of it which takes up the better part of its width.
            In the deepest part of the bay on shore we saw a great smoke, which was at a village
            belonging to the bay, to which place the people were removed from the point
            above-mentioned. This after- noon we had a small Westerly wind, our course being S.S.W.
            Hereabouts it is all along a very bold shore. At three o'clock in the afternoon we
            tacked about to clear the point. Being now a httle way without the point, we spied a
            sail, which we conceived to be a bark. Hereupon we hoisted out our canoe, and sent in
            purstiit of her, which made directly for the shore. But the sail proved to be nothing
            else than a pair of bark- logs ^, which, arriving on shore, the men spread their sail on
            ^ The modern balsa, balza : cf. Hakluyt, Voyages [1600], vol. iii, p. 416 : " . . . it
            was so well peopled with Indians, which had so many canoas of wood, as we might
            discerne, and not raftes or balsas, for so they call those floats which are made all
            flat with canes." THE CITY OF GUAYAQUIL 357 the sand of the bay to dry. At the same time
            there came down on the shore an Indian on horseback, who hallooed to our canoe, which
            had followed the logs. But our men, fearing to discover who we were, in case they went
            too near the shore, left the design and returned back to us. In these parts the Indians
            have no canoes, nor any wood indeed that may be thought fit to make them of. Had we been
            descried by these poor people, they would in all probability have been very fearful of
            us. But they offered not to stir, which gave us to understand they knew us not. We could
            perceive from the ship a great path leading to the hills, so that we beUeved this place
            to be a look-out, or watch-place, for the security of Guayaquil. Between four and five
            we doubled the point, and then we descried the Point Chandy, at the distance of six
            leagues S.S.E. from this point. At first sight it seemed like to a long island, but
            withal, lower than that of St Helena. Tuesday, August 24th, at noon, we took the other
            ship, wherein Captain Cox sailed in tow, she being every day a greater hindrance than
            before to our voyage. Thus, about three in the afternoon we lost sight of land, in
            standing over for Cape Blanco. Here we found a strong current to move to the S.W. The
            wind was at S.W. by S., our course being S. by E. At the upper end of this gulf, which
            is framed by the two capes aforementioned, stands the city of Guaya- quil, being a very
            rich place, and the emharcadero, or sea-port, to the great city of Quito. To this place
            Hkewise many of the merchants of Lima do usually send the money they design for Old
            Spain in barks, and by that means save the custom that otherwise they would pay to the
            King by carrying it on board the fleet. Hither comes much gold from Quito, and very good
            and strong broadcloth, together with images for the use of the churches, and several
            other things of con- siderable value. But more especially coco-nut, whereof chocolate is
            made, which is supposed here to be the best in the whole universe. The town of Guayaquil
            consists of about 150 great houses, and twice as many Httle ones. This was the town to
            which Captain Sawkins intended to make his voyage, as was mentioned above. When ships of
            greater burden come into this gulf, they anchor outside Lapina, and then put their
            lading into lesser vessels to carry it to the 358 THEY CAPTURE A SPANISH BARK town.
            Towards the evening of this day a small breeze sprang up, varying from point to point,
            after which, about nine o'clock at night, we tacked about, and stood off to sea, W. by
            N. As soon as we had tacked, we happened to spy a sail N.N.E. from us. Hereupon we
            instantly cast off our other vessel which we had in tow, and stood round about after
            them. We came very near to the vessel before the people saw us, by reason of the
            darkness of the night. As soon as they spied us, they immediately clapped on a wind, and
            sailed very well before us, insomuch that it was a pretty while before we could come up
            with them and within call. We hailed them in Spanish, by means of an Indian prisoner,
            and commanded them to lower their top-sails. They answered they would soon make us to
            lower our own. Hereupon we fired several guns at them, and they as thick at us again
            with their harque- buses^. Thus they fought us for the space of half-an-hour or more,
            and would have done it longer, had we not killed the man at the helm, after which none
            of the rest dared to be so hardy as to take his place. With another of our shot we cut
            in pieces and disabled their main-top halliards. Here- upon they cried out for quarter,
            which we gave them, and entered their ship. Being possessed of the vessel, we found in
            her five-and-thirty men, of which number 24 were natives of Old Spain. They had one-and-
            thirty firearms on board the ship for their defence. They had only fought us, as they
            declared afterwards, out of bravado, having promised on shore so to do, in case they met
            us at sea. The Captain of this vessel was a person of quality, and his brother, since
            the death of Don Jacinto de Barabona, killed by us in the engagement before Panama, was
            now made Admiral of the sea-armada. With him we took also in this bark five or six other
            persons of quality. They did us in this fight, though short, very great damage in our
            rigging, by cutting it in pieces, besides which they wounded two of our men, and a third
            man was wounded by the negligence of one of our own men, occasioned by a pistol which
            went off un- advisedly. About eleven o'clock this night we stood off to the west. 1 An

            morning, about break of day, we hoisted out our canoe, and went aboard the bark which we
            had taken the night before. We transported on board our own ship more of the prisoners
            taken in the said vessel, and began to examine them, to learn what intelligence we could
            from them. The Captain of the vessel, who was a very civil and meek gentle- man,
            satisfied our desires in this point very exactly, saying to us : Gentlemen, I am now
            your prisoner-at-war by the over-ruling providence of fortune, and, moreover, am very
            well satisfied that no money whatsoever can procure my ransom, at least for the present
            at your hands. Hence I am persuaded it is not my interest to tell you a lie, which if I
            do I desire you to punish me as severely as you shall think fit. We heard of your taking
            and de- stroying our Armadilla and other ships at Panama, about six weeks after that
            engagement, by two several barks which arrived here thence. But they could not inform us
            whether you designed to come any farther to the southward, but, rather, desired we would
            send them speedily all the help by sea that we could. Hereupon we sent the noise and
            rumour of your being in these seas by land to Lima, desiring they would expedite what
            succours they could send to join with ours. We had at that time in our harbour two or
            three great ships, but all of them very unfit to sail. For this reason at Lima the
            Viceroy of Peru pressed three great merchant ships, into the biggest of which he put 14
            brass guns, into the second 10, and in the other 6. To these he added two barks, and put
            750 soldiers on board them all. Of this number of men they landed eight-score at Point
            St Helena, all the rest being carried down to Panama, with design to fight you there.
            Besides these forces, two other men-of-war, bigger than the aforementioned, are still
            lying at Lima, and fitting out there in all speed to follow and pursue you. One of these
            men-of-war is equipped with 36 brass guns, and the other with 30. These ships, besides
            their complement of seamen, have 400 soldiers added to them by the Viceroy. Another
            man-of-war belonging to this number, and lesser than the aforementioned, is called the
            Patache. This ship consists of 24 guns, and was sent to Arica to fetch the King's plate
            thence. But the Viceroy, having received intelli- gence of your exploits at Panama, sent
            for this ship back from there with such haste that they came away and left the money
            behind them. Hence the Patache now lies at the port of Callao, ready to sail on the
            first occasion or news of your arrival there- abouts, they having for this purpose sent
            to all parts very strict orders to keep a good, look-out on all sides, and all places
            along 36o THE SPANISH CAPTAIN'S RELATION the coasts. Since this, from Manta they sent us
            word that they had seen two ships at sea pass hy that place. And from the Goat Key also
            we heard that the Indians had seen you, and that they were assured one of your vessels
            was the ship called La Trinidad, which you had taken before Panama, as being a ship very
            well known in these seas. Hence we concluded that your design was to ply, and make your
            voyage thereabouts. Now this bark wherein you took us prisoners, being bound for Panama,
            the Governor of Guayaquil sent us out before her departure, if possible to discover you,
            which, if we did, we were to run the bark on shore and get away, or else to fight you
            with these soldiers and firearms that you see. As soon as we heard of your being in
            these seas, we built two forts, the one of six guns, and the other of four, for the
            defence of the town. At the last muster taken in the town of Guayaquil we had there 850
            men of all colours, but when we came out, we left only 200 men that were actually under
            arms. Thus ended the relation of that worthy gentleman. About noon that day we unrigged
            the bark which we had taken, and after so doing sunk her. Then we stood S.S.E., and
            after- wards S. by W. and S.S.W. That evening we saw point St Helena at N. half E., at
            the distance of nine leagues, more or less. The next day, being August 26th, in the
            morning we stood S. That day we cried out all our pillage, and found that it amounted to
            3,276 pieces-of-eight, which was accordingly divided by shares amongst us. We also
            punished a friar, who was chaplain to the bark aforementioned, and shot him upon the
            deck, casting him overboard before he was dead. Such cruelties, though I abhorred very
            much in my heart, yet here was I forced to hold my tongue and contradict them not, as
            having not authority to oversway them. At ten o'clock this morning we saw land again,
            and the pilot said we were sixteen leagues to leeward of Cabo Blanco. Hereupon we stood
            off and on, close under the shore, which all appeared to be barren land. The morning
            following we had very little wind, so that we advanced but slowly all that day. To
            windward of us we could perceive the continent to be all high land, being whitish clay,
            full of white cliffs. This morning, in common discourse, our prisoners confessed to us
            and acknowledged the destruc- tion of one of our little barks, which we lost on our way
            to CAPE BLANCO 361 the island of Cayboa. They stood away, as it appeared by their
            information, for the Goat Key, thinking to find us there, as having heard Captain
            Sawkins say that he would go thither. On their way they happened to fall in with the
            island of Gallo, and understanding its weakness by their Indian pilot, they ventured on
            shore and took the place, carrying away three white women in their company. But, after a
            small time of cruising, they returned again to the aforesaid island, where they stayed
            two or three days, after which they went out to sea again. Within three or four days
            they came to a little quay four leagues distant from this isle. But, whilst they had
            been out and in thus several times, one of their prisoners made his escape to the
            mainland, and brought off thence 50 men with firearms. These, placing themselves in
            ambush, at the first volley killed six of the seven men that belonged to the bark. The
            other man that was left took quarter of the enemy, and he it was that discovered to them
            our design upon the town of Guayaquil. By an observation which we made this day we found
            ourselves to be in lat. 3° 50". At this time, our prisoners told us there was an embargo
            laid on all the Spanish ships, commanding them not to stir out of the ports, for fear of
            their falling into our hands at sea. Saturday, August 28th. This morning we took out all
            the water, and most part of the flour that was in Captain Cox's vessel. The people in
            like manner came on board our ship. Having done this, we made a hole in the vessel and
            left her to sink, with a small old canoe at her stern. To leeward of Manta, a league
            from shore, in 18 fathom water, there runs a great current outwards. About eleven in the
            forenoon we weighed anchor, with a wind at W.N.W. turning it out. Our number now in all
            being reckoned, we found ourselves to be 140 men, two boys, and 55 prisoners, being all
            now in one and the same bottom. This day we got six or seven leagues in the wind's eye.
            h All the day following we had a very strong S.S.W. wind, insomuch that we were forced
            to sail with two reefs in our main-top sail and one also in our fore-top sail. Here
            Captain Peralta told us that the first place which the Spaniards settled in these parts,
            after Panama, was Tumbes, a place that now was to leeward of us, in this gulf where we
            now were. That there a priest went .ashore with a cross in his hand, while 362 THE
            PRIEST, LIONS, AND TIGERS 10,000 Indians stood gazing at him. Being landed on the
            strand, there came out of the woods two Hons ; and he laid the cross gently on their
            backs, and they instantly fell down and worshipped it : and moreover, that two tigers,
            following them, did the same — whereby these animals gave to the Indians to understand
            the excellency of the Christian religion, which they soon after embraced. About four in
            the evening we came abreast the cape, which is the highest part of all. The land
            hereabouts appeared to be barren and rocky. At 3 leagues distance east from us the cape
            showed thus : — Cape Blanco Were it not for a windward current which runs under the
            shore hereabouts, it were totally impossible for any ships to get about this cape, there
            being such a great current to leeward in the offing. In the last bark which we took, of
            which we spoke in this chapter, we made prisoner one Nicolas Moreno, a Spaniard by
            nation, who was esteemed to be a very good pilot of the South Sea. This man did not
            cease continually to praise our ship for her sailing, and especially for the alterations
            we had made in her. As we went along, we observed many bays to lie between this cape and
            Point Parina, of which we shall soon make mention hereafter. In the night the wind came
            about to S.S.E. and we had a very stiff gale of it ; so that by break of day the next
            morning we found ourselves to be about 5 leagues distant to windward of the cape
            aforementioned. The land hereabouts makes three or four several bays, and grows lower
            and lower the nearer we came to Punta Parina. This point looks at first sight Uke two
            islands. Between four and five of the clock that evening we were W. from the said point.
            The next day likewise, being the last day of August, the wind still continued S.S.E. as
            it had done the whole day before. This day we thought it convenient to stand farther I
            POINT PARINA 363 out to sea, for fear of being descried at Paita, which now was not very
            far distant from us. The morning proved to be hazy — but about eleven we spied a sail,
            which stood then just as we did E. by S. Coming nearer to it, by degrees we found her to
            be nothing else than a pair of bark-logs under a sail, which were going that way. Our
            pilot advised us not to meddle with those logs, nor mind them in the least, for it was
            very doubtful whether we should be able to come up with them or not, and then by giving
            chase to them we should easily be descried and known to be the English pirates, as they
            called us. These bark-logs sail excellently well for the most part, and some of them are
            of such a size that they will carry 250 packs of meal from the valleys to Panama without
            wetting any of it. This day, by an observation made, we found ourselves to be in lat. 4°
            55' S. Point Parina at N.E. by E., and at the distance of 6 leagues, more or less, gives
            this following appearance : — PuNTA Parina At the same time La Silla de Paita bore from
            us S.E. by E., being distant only 7 or 8 leagues. It had the form of a high mountain,
            and appeared thus to us : — La Silla de Paita The town of Paita itself is situated in a
            deep bay, about 2 leagues to leeward of this hill. It serves for an emharcadero, or
            port-town, to another great place which is distant thence about 13 leagues higher in the
            country and is called Piura, seated in a very barren country. On Wednesday, September
            ist, our course was S. by W. The midnight before this day we had a land-wind that sprang
            364 LA SILLA DE PAITA up. In the afternoon La Silla de Paita, at the distance of 7
            leagues, at E. by N. appeared thus : — La Silla de Paita All along hereabouts is nothing
            but barren land, as was said before : likewise, for three or four days last past, we
            observed along the coasts many seals. That night as we sailed we saw something that
            appeared to us to be as it were a light. And the next morning we spied a sail, whence we
            judged the light had come. The vessel was at the distance of six leagues from us, in the
            wind's eye, and thereupon we gave her chase. She stood to windward as we did. This day
            we had an observation, which gave us lat. 5° 30' S. At night we were about 4 leagues to
            leeward of her, but so great a mist fell that we suddenly lost sight of her. At this
            time the weather was as cold with us as in England in November. Every time we went about
            with our ship the other did the like. Our pilot told us that this ship set forth from
            Guayaquil eleven days before they were taken, and that she was laden with rigging,
            woollen and common cloth, and other manufactures made at Quito. Moreover, that he had
            heard that they had spent a mast, and had put into Paita to refit it. The night
            following they showed us several lights through their negligence, which they ought not
            to have done, for by that means we steered directly after them. The next morn- ing she
            was more than 3 leagues in the wind's eye distant from us. Had they suspected us, it
            could not be doubted but they would have made away towards the land, but they seemed not
            to fly nor stir for our chase. The land here all along is level, and not very high. The
            weather was hazy, so that at about eleven o'clock that morning we lost sight of her. At
            this time we had been for the space of a whole week, at an allowance of only two
            draughts of water each day, so scarce were provisions with us. That afternoon we saw the
            vessel again, and at night we were not full two leagues CAPTURE OF THE SPANISH SHIP 365
            distant from her, and not more than half-a-league to leeward. We made short trips all
            the night long. On Saturday, September 4th, about break of day, we saw the ship again at
            the distance of a league, more or less, and not above a mile to windward of us. They
            stood out as soon as they espied us, and we stood directly after them. Having pursued
            them for several hours, about four o'clock in the afternoon, we came up within the
            distance of half our small- arms shot, to windward of them. Hereupon they, perceiving
            who we were, presently lowered all their sails at once, and we cast dice among ourselves
            for the first entrance. The lot fell to larboard, so that 20 men belonging to that watch
            entered her. In the vessel were found 50 packs of coco-nut, such as chocolate is made
            of, many packs of raw silk, Indian cloth, and thread stockings : these things being the
            principal part of her cargo. We stood out S.W. by S. all the night following. The next
            day being come, we transported on board our ship the chief part of her lading. In her
            hold we found some rigging, as had been told us by Nicholas Moreno, our pilot, taken in
            the former vessel off Guayaquil ; but the greatest part of the hold was full of timber.
            We took out of her also some osnaburgs^, of which we made top-gallant sails, as shall be
            said hereafter. It was now nineteen days, as they told us, since they had set sail from
            Guayaquil, and then they had only heard there of our exploits before Panama, but did not
            so much as think of our coming so far to the southward, which did not give them the
            least suspicion of us, though they had seen us for the space of two or three days before
            at sea and always steering after them — otherwise they had made for the land, and
            endeavoured to escape our hands. The next morning, likewise, we continued to take in the
            remaining part of what goods we desired out of our prize. When we had done, we sent most
            of our prisoners on board the said vessel, and left only their foremast standing, all
            the rest being cut down by the board. We gave them a foresail to sail withal, all their
            own water, and some of our flour to serve them for provisions, and thus we turned them
            away, not caring to be troubled or encumbered with too many of their company.
            Notwithstanding, we detained still several ^ Coarse linens, originally exported from
            Osnaburg, in Cciir.any. Z66 THE VOYAGE TOWARDS ARICA of the chief of our prisoners. Such
            were Don Thomas de Argandona, who was Commander of the vessel taken before Guayaquil,
            Don Christoval, and Don Baltazar, both gentle- men of quahty taken with him, Captain
            Peralta, Captain Juan Moreno, the pilot, and twelve slaves, of whom we intended to make
            good use, to do the drudgery of our ship. At this time I reckoned that we were about the
            distance of 35 leagues, little more or less, from land ; moreover, by an observation
            made this day, we found lat. 7° i' S. Our plunder being over and our prize turned away,
            we sold both chests, boxes, and several other things at the mast, by the voice of a
            crier. On the following day we stood S.S.W. and S.W. by S. all day long. That day one of
            our company died, named Robert Montgomery, the same man who was shot by the negligence
            of one of our own men with a pistol through the leg at the taking of the vessel before
            Guayaquil, as was mentioned above. We had an observation also this day, by which we now
            found lat. 7° 26' S. On the same day likewise we made a dividend, and shared all the
            booty taken in the last prize. This being done, we hoisted into our ship the launch
            which we had taken in her, as being useful to us. All these days last past it was
            observed that we had every morning a dark cloud in the sky, which in the North Sea would
            certainly foretell a storm — but here it always blew over. Wednesday, September 8th, in
            the morning, we threw our dead man above-mentioned into the sea, and gave him three
            French volleys for his funeral ceremony. In the night before this day we saw a light
            belonging to some vessel at sea, but we stood away from it, as not desiring to see any
            more sails to hinder us in our voyage towards Arica, whither now we were designed. This
            light was undoubtedly from some ship to leeward of us, but on the next morning we could
            descry no sail. Here I judged we had made a S.W. by S. way from Paita, and by an
            observation found 8° 00' S. CHAPTER XIII A continuation of their long and tedious voyage
            to Arica, with a description of the coasts and sailings thereunto. Great hard- ship they
            endured for want of water and other provisions. They are descried at Arica, and dare not
            land there — the country being all in arms before them. They retire thence, and go to
            Puerto de Hilo, close by Arica. Here they land, take the town with little or no loss on
            their side, refresh themselves with provisions, but in the end are cheated by the
            Spaniards, and forced shamefully to retreat thence On September 9th we continued still
            to make a S.W. by S. way, as we had done the day before. By a clear and exact
            observation, taken the same day, we found now lat. 8° 12' S. All the twenty-four hours
            last past afforded us but little wind, so that we advanced but little on our voyage, and
            were forced to tack about every four or five hours. The next day, by another observation
            taken, we found then lat. 9° 00' S. Now the weather was much warmer than before, and
            with this warmth we had small and misty rains that frequently fell. That evening a
            strong breeze came up at S.E. by E. The night following, likewise, we had a very great
            dew that fell, and a fresh wind continued to blow. At this time we were all hard at work
            to make small sails of the osnaburgs we had taken in the last prize, as being much more
            convenient for then: lightness. The next morning being Saturday, September nth, we lay
            by to mend our rigging. These last twenty-four hours we had made a S. by W. way. And now
            we had an observation that gave us lat. 10° 9' S. I supposed this day that we were west
            from Cosmey, about the distance of eighty-nine leagues and a half. September 12th. This
            day we reckoned a S.S.W. way, 367 368 THE VOYAGE TO ARICA and that we had made 34
            leagues and three-quarters, or thereabouts. Also that all our westing from Paita was
            eighty-four leagues. We supposed ourselves now to be in lat. 11° 40' S. But, the weather
            being hazy, no observation could be made. September 13th. Yesterday in the afternoon we
            had a great eclipse of the sun, which lasted from one o'clock till three after dinner.
            From this eclipse I then took the true judgment of our longitude from the Canary
            Islands, and found myself to be 285° 35', in lat. 11° 45' S. The wind was now so fresh
            that we took in our top-sails, making a great way under our courses and sprit-sail.
            September 14th we had a cloudy morning, which con- tinued so all the first part thereof.
            About eight it cleared up, and then we set our fore-topsail and, about noon, our
            main-topsail likewise. This was observable, that all this great wind precedent did not
            make anything of a great sea. We reckoned this day that we had run by a S.W. by W. way,
            26 leagues and two-thirds. The next day, in like manner, we had close weather, such as
            the former morning. Our reckoning was twenty-four leagues and two-thirds, by a S.W. by
            W. way. But, by obser- vation made, I found myself to be 23° S. of my reckoning, as
            being in the lat. of 15° 17' S. On the 1 6th we had but small and variable winds. For
            the twenty-four hours last past we reckoned 24 leagues and two-thirds, by a S.W. by S.
            way. By observation we had lat. 16° 41'. That evening we had a gale at E.S.E. which
            forced us to hand our top-sails. The 17th, likewise, we had many gusts of wind at
            several times, forcing us to hand our top-sails often. But in the forenoon we set them
            with a fresh gale at E.S.E. My reckon- ing this day was 31 leagues, by a S.S.W. way. All
            day long we stood by our top-sails. On the 1 8th we made a S. by W. way. We reckoned
            ourselves to be in lat. 19° 33' S. The weather was hazy, and the wind began to die this
            day by degrees. The next day, being the 19th, we had very small wind. I reckoned 13
            leagues and a-half, by a S.W. by S. way, and our whole westing from Paita to be 164
            leagues in lat. 20° 06' S. All the afternoon we had a calm, with drizzling rain. THE
            VOYAGE TO ARICA 369 Monday, September 20th. Last night we saw the clouds, which are so
            famous among the Magellan mariners of these Southern seas. The least of these clouds was
            about the bigness of a man's hat. After this sight the morning was very clear. We had
            run at noon at E.S.E. 13 leagues and a-half, and, by an observation then made, we found
            lat. 20° 15' S. This day the wind began to freshen at W. by S. Yet, notwithstanding, we
            had a very smooth sea. But on the next morning the wind came about to S.W., and yet
            slackened by degrees. At four this morning it came to S. by E., and at ten the same day
            to S.E. by S. We had had this day a clear observation, and by it lat. 20° 25' S. We
            stood now E. by N,, with the wind at S.E. September 22nd. This morning the wind was at
            E.S.E. By a clear observation we found lat. 19° 30' S. Likewise on a N.E. by E. way.
            September 23rd. We had a fresh wind and a high sea. This morning early the wind was at
            E. and about ten at E.N.E. From a clear observation we found our latitude to be 20° 35'
            S. The way we made was S. by W. That morning we happened to split our sprit-sail. Next
            morning the wind was variable and inconstant, and the weather but hazy. We reckoned a S.
            by E. way : this day we bent a new main-topsail, the old one serving for a fore-topsail.
            In the afternoon we had but little wind, whereupon we lowered our top-sails, having in
            like manner a very smooth sea. The following day, likewise, brought us calm and warm
            weather, which occasioned us to set up our shrouds both fore and aft. An observation
            taken this day afforded us lat. 21° 57'. That evening we bent a sprit-sail. On September
            26th an observation gave us lat. 22° 05' S. At noon we had a breeze at N.N.E., our
            course being E.S.E. In the afternoon we set up a larboard top-sail studding- sail. In
            the evening the wind came about at N. pretty fresh. The next day we had a smooth sea,
            and took in four studding-sails. For yesterday in the afternoon we had put out, besides
            that above-mentioned, another studding-sail and two main studding-sails more. This day
            we had by observa- tion 22° 45' S., having made by an E.S.E. way thirty-five 370 THE
            VOYAGE TO ARICA leagues and a-half — our whole meridian difference 68 leagues and
            a-half. September 28th. All the forenoon we had very little wind, and yet withal a great
            southern sea. By observation we had lat. 22° 40' S. September 29th. All the night past
            we had much wind, with three or four fierce showers of rain. This was the first that we
            could call rain, ever since we left Cape Francisco above-mentioned. This day our
            allowance was shortened, and reduced to three-pints-and-a-half of water, and one cake of
            boiled bread to each man for a day. An observation this day gave us lat. 21° 59' S. by a
            N.E. by E. way. On September 30th we had a cloudy day, and the wind very variable, the
            morning being fresh. Our way was N.E. half N., wherein we made 18 leagues. October ist.
            All the night past and this day we had a cloudy sky and not much wind. We made a N.E. by
            E. way, and by it 17 leagues and two miles. This day we began at two-pints-and-a-half of
            water for a day. The 2nd, we made a E.N.E. way, and by it 26 leagues, more or less. Our
            observation this day gave us lat. 20° 29' S. I reckoned now that we were 10 leagues and
            a-half to E. of our meridian, the port of Paita, so that henceforward our departure was
            eastward. The wind was this day at S.E. by S. On the 3rd we had both a cloudy morning, a
            high sea, and drizzling weather. An observation which we had this day jave us lat. 19°
            45' S. In the afternoon the wind blew so .resh that we were forced to hand our top-sails
            and sprit- sail. The 4th, likewise, we had a high sea and a cold wind. At break of day
            we set our top-sails. An observation made afforded us lat. 19° 8' S. Here we supposed
            ourselves fifty- nine leagues D.M. The 5th, we had still a great sea, and sharp and cold
            winds, forcing us to our low sails. By a N.E. by E. way we reckoned this day 26 leagues
            and a-half. But on the 6th we had great gusts of wind. Insomuch that this morning our
            ring-bolts gave way which held our main-stay, and had like to have brought our main-mast
            by the board. Hereupon we ran three or four glasses west before the wind. By an
            observation we found lat. 19° 4' S. THE VOYAGE TO ARICA 371 On October 7th the wind had
            somewhat fallen. We had both a cloudy day and variable winds. The 8th of the said month
            we had again a smooth sea and small whiffling winds. This morning we saw a huge shoal of
            fish, two or three water-snakes, and several seals. On the next day we had in like
            manner a very smooth sea, and withal a cloudy day. Our course was E. October loth. We
            had likewise a cloudy day, with small and variable winds, and, what is consequent to
            these, a smooth sea. Our way was S. by E. This day we spied floating upon the sea
            several tufts of sea-grass, which gave us good hopes that we were not far from shore. In
            the after- noon we had a N.E. by E. wind that sprang up : the night was very cold and
            cloudy. On the nth we had a fresh wind at S.E. and E.S.E. together with a cloudy day,
            such as we had experienced for several days before. We reckoned this day 32 leagues by a
            N.E. by E. way. Here our pilot told us that the sky is always hazy near the shore upon
            these coasts where we now were. On October 12th we had a clear day, and N.E. way. The
            13th we had but little wind. This day we saw a whale, which we took for an infallible
            token that we were not far distant from land, which now we hoped to see in a few days.
            We made an E.S.E. way, and by it we reckoned nineteen leagues. All the evening was very
            calm. Thursday, October 14th, we had both a calm and close day until the afternoon. Then
            the weather became very hot and clear. This day we saw several land- fowls, being but
            small birds, concerning which our pilot said that they use to appear about one or two
            days' sail from the land. Our reckoning was 11 leagues by an E.S.E. way. In the evening
            of this day we thought that we had seen land, but it proved to be nothing else than a
            fog-bank. October 15th. Both the night past and this day was very clear. We made an
            observation this day, which gave us lat. 18° 00' S. The i6th. Last night and this day
            were contrary to the former, both cloudy. Our way was N.E. by E. whereof we reckoned 13
            leagues. Sunday, October 17th, the wind blew very fresh, our course being E.N.E. About
            five that morning we saw land, 37^ THE POINT OF HILO but the weather was so hazy that at
            first we could scarce perceive whether it was land or not. It was distant from us about
            eight leagues, and appeared as a high and round hill, being in form like a sugar-loaf.
            We saw land afterwards all along to the S.E. by E. from it. In the evening, we being
            then within 5 leagues of the shore, the land appeared very high and steep. October i8th.
            All the night last past we stood off to sea with a fresh wind. This morning we could
            just see land at N.N.E. We reckoned a S.E. by E. way, and by observation we found lat.
            17° 17' S. Tuesday, October 19th. We had very cloudy weather, finding what our pilot had
            told us to be very true concerning the haziness of this shore. We saw all along as we
            went very high land, covered with clouds, insomuch that we could not see its top. On
            Wednesday, the next day, we had hkewise cloudy weather, and for the most part calm. The
            same weather being very cloudy, as before, continued in like manner on Thursday. Friday,
            October 22nd. This morning we saw the land plain before us. Our pilot, being asked what
            land that was, answered it was the Point of Hilo. At N.N.E. and about 6 or 7 leagues
            distance it appeared thus to us : — PuNTA DE Hilo LAT. 1 8** 4' 5. There is every
            morning and evening a brightness over the point which lasted for two or three hours,
            being caused by the reflection of the sun on the barren land, as it is sup- posed. This
            day we had but little wind, and the huge want of water we were now under occasioned much
            disturbance among our men. As for my part, I must acknowledge I could not sleep all
            night long through the greatness of my drought. We could wiUingly have landed here to
            seek for water, but the fear of being discovered and making ourselves known hindered us
            from so doing. Thus we unanimously THE POINT OF HILO 373 resolved to endure our thirst
            for a little longer. Hereabouts is a small current that runs under the shore. This
            morning we had but little wind at S., our course being E.S.E. The point at the distance
            of 5 leagues N.E. looks on the following side thus : — PUNTA DE HiLO Our wind continued
            to blow not about six hours each day. We reckoned the difference of our meridian to be
            this day 180 leagues. Very great was our affliction now for want of water, we having but
            half-a-pint a day to our allowance. October 23rd. This day we were forced to spare one
            measure of water, thereby to make it hold out the longer, so scarce it became with us.
            At three this afternoon the point looked thus : — PUNTA DE HiLO Mora de Sama Here the
            point looks like an island, and Mora de Sama to the southward thereof, gives this
            appearance : — Mora de Sama At about nine o'clock at night we had a land wind, and with
            it we stood S.E. by S., but all the night after we had but little wind. 374 MORA DE SAMA
            October 24th, All the night past we had very cloudy and dark weather, with mizzUng rain.
            The morning being come it cleared up, but all the land appeared covered with clouds.
            Yet, notwithstanding, in the afternoon it gave us again this appearance :— - Mora de
            Sama LAT. 18" 29' S. Under the hill of Mora de Sama are eighteen or nineteen white
            cliffs, which appear in the form thus described. This day we resolved that 112 men
            should go ashore, and at about eight this evening we sent our launch and four canoes,
            with four-score men, to take three or four fishermen at a certain river, close by Mora
            de Sama, called El Rio de Juan Diaz, with intent to gain what intelligence we could as
            to how affairs stood at present on the coast and country thereabouts. Monday, October
            25th. Last night being about the distance of one-league-and-a-half from shore, we
            sounded, and found forty-five fathom water, with a hard ground at the bottom. This
            morning our people and canoes that were sent to take the fishermen returned, not being
            able to find either their houses or the river. They reported withal they had had a very
            fresh wind all the night long under shore, whereas we had not one breath of wind all
            night on board. Tuesday, October 26th, Last night, being the night before this day,
            about six o'clock we departed from the ship to go to take Arica, resolving to land about
            the distance of a league to windward of the town. We were about 6 leagues distant from
            the town when we left our ship, whereby we were forced to row all night, that we might
            reach the place of our landing before day. Towards morning the canoes left the launch,
            which they had had all night in tow and wherein I was, and made all the speed they
            possibly could for the shore, with design to land before the launch could arrive. But,
            being come nigh the place where we designed to land, they found to our great sorrow and
            vexation that we were descried, and THE APPROACH TO ARICA 375 that all along the shore
            and through the country they had certain news of our arrival. Vet, notwithstanding our
            dis- covery, we would have landed if we could by any means have found a place to do it
            in. But the sea ran so high, and with such a force against the rocks, that our boats
            must have each been staved into one thousand pieces, and we in great danger of wetting
            our arms, if we should adventure to go on shore. The bay all round, and Hkewise the tops
            of the hills, was possessed by several parties of horse which seemed to be gathered
            there by a general alarm through the whole country, and they waited only for our
            landing, with design to make a strong opposition against us. They fired a gun at us, but
            we made them no answer, but rather returned to our ship, giving over this enterprise
            until a fairer opportunity. The hill of Arica is very white, being occasioned by the
            dung of multitudes of fowls that nest themselves in the hollow thereof. To leeward of
            the said hill lies a small island at the distance of a mile, more or less, from the
            shore. About half-a-league from that island we could perceive six ships to ride at
            anchor, four of which had their yards taken down from their masts, but the other two
            seemed to be ready to sail. We asked our pilot concerning these ships, and he told us
            that one of them was mounted with six guns, and the other with only four. Being
            disappointed of our expectations at Arica, we now resolved to bear away thence to the
            village of Hilo, there to take in water and other provisions, as also to learn what
            inteUigence we could obtain. All that night we lay under a calm. On October 27th, in the
            morning, we found ourselves to be about a league to windward of Mora de Sama. Yet, not-
            withstanding, the weather was quite calm, and we only drove with the current to leeward.
            The land between Hilo and Mora de Sama forms two several bays, and the coast runs along
            N.W. and S.E., as may appear by the following demonstration. Over the land we could see
            from our ship, as we drifted, the coming or rising of a very high land, at a great
            distance far up in the country. October 28th. The night before this day we sent away our
            four canoes with 50 men in them, to seize and plunder the town of Hilo. All that day was
            very calm, as the day before. 376 THE PORT OF HILO The next morning, about break of day,
            a fair breeze sprang up, with which we lay right in with the port. About one in the
            afternoon we anchored, and the port Hes thus, as is here described : — Port of Hilo We
            cast anchor at the distance of two miles from the village, and then we perceived two
            flags, which our men had put out, having taken the town and set up our English colours.
            The Spaniards were retreated to the hills, and there had done the same. Being come to an
            anchor, our Commander, Captain Sharp, sent a canoe on board of us, and ordered that all
            the men our ship could spare should come ashore. Withal they told us that those of our
            party that landed the morning before were met by some horsemen on the shore, who only
            exchanged some few volleys of shot with our men, but were soon put to flight. That
            hereupon our forces had marched directly to the town, where the Spaniards, expecting we
            should have landed at first, had made a breastwork, thirty paces long, of clay and banks
            of sand. Here, in a small skirmish, we happened to kill an Indian, who told us before he
            died that they had received news of our coming nine days ago, from Lima, and but one day
            before from Arica. Having taken the town, we found therein great quantity of pitch, tar,
            oil, wine, and flour, with several other sorts of provisions. We endeavoured to keep as
            good a watch as the Spaniards did on the hills, fearing lest they should suddenly make
            an attempt to destroy us. On the next day, October 30th, we chose out three-score men of
            them who were the fittest to march, from among the rest, and ordered them to go up and
            search the valley adjoining and belonging to the town. We found the said valley to be
            very pleasant, being all over set with fig, olive, orange, lemon, and lime-trees, with
            many other fruits agree- able to the palate. About four miles up, within the valley, we
            came to a great sugar-works, or ingenio d'azucar, as it is called by the Spaniards,
            where we found great store of sugar. THE SUGAR-WORKS 377 oil, and molasses, but most of
            the sugar the owners had hidden from us in the cane itself. As we marched up the valley
            the Spaniards marched along the hills, and observed our motion. From the tops of the
            hills they often tumbled down great stones upon us, but with great care we endeavoured
            to escape those dangers, and the report of our gun would suddenly cause them all to hide
            their heads. From this house, I mean the sugar-works above-mentioned, Mr Cox, myself,
            and one Cannis, a Dutchman (who was then our interpreter), went to the Spaniards with a
            flag of truce. They met us very civilly, and promised to give us four-score beeves as
            ransom of the sugar-work upon condition that it should not be spoilt nor demolished. We
            agreed with them that they should be delivered to us at the port next day at noon.
            Hereupon Captain Sharp, in the evening, sent down to the port 20 men, with strict orders
            that our forces there should offer no violence to those that brought down the beeves.
            Sunday, October 31st. This day being employed in casting up some accounts belonging to
            our navigation, I reckoned that Hilo was to the eastward of Paita one hundred and
            eighty-seven leagues. This morning the Captain of the Spaniards came to our Commander,
            Captain Sharp, with a flag of truce, and told him that sixteen beeves were already sent
            down to the port and that the rest should certainly be there the next morning. Hereupon
            we were ordered to prepare ourselves to retreat, and march back to the port, and there
            embark ourselves on board our ship. My advice was to the contrary, that we should rather
            leave 20 men behind to keep the house of the sugar-works, and that others should possess
            themselves of the hills, thereby to clear them of the Spaniards and their look-out. But,
            my counsel not being regarded, each man took away what burden of sugar he pleased, and
            thus we returned to our vessel. Being come there, we found no beeves had been brought
            down at all, which occasioned us much to suspect some double-dealing would in the latter
            end be found in this case. The next morning, November ist, our Captain went to the top
            of the hills aforementioned, and spoke with the Spaniards themselves concerning the
            performance of their agreement. The Spaniards made answer that the cattle would
            certainly come down this night, but, in case they did 378 THE BUCCANEERS TAKE REVENGE
            not, that the master or owner of the sugar- works had now returned from Potosi, and we
            might go up and treat with him, and make, if we pleased, a new bargain for the preserva-
            tion of his house and goods, it being his interest more than theirs to save it from
            being demolished. With this answer our men returned to us, and we decided to wait until
            the next day for the delivery of the beeves. On the following day, about eight in the
            morning, there came in to us a flag of truce from the enemy, telling us that the winds
            were so high that they could not drive the cattle, otherwise they had been delivered
            before now. But withal that by noon we should in no manner fail to have them brought to
            us. Noon being come and no cattle appearing, we, now having filled our water and
            finished other concerns, resolved to be revenged on the enemy, and do them what mischief
            we could, at least by setting fire to the sugar-works. Hereupon three-score men of us
            marched up the valley, and burnt both the house, the canes, and the mill belonging to
            the ingenio. We broke likewise the coppers, coggs, and multitudes of great jars of oil
            that we found in the house. This being done, we brought away more sugar, and returned to
            the port over the hills or mountains, which we found to be very pleasant, smooth, and
            level after once we had ascended them. It fell out very fortunately to us that we
            returned back this way, for otherwise our men at the seaside had inevitably been cut off
            and torn in pieces by the enemy, they being at that time dispersed and straggling up and
            down in parties of two and three. For from the hills we spied coming from the northward
            of the bay above 300 horsemen, all riding at full speed towards our men, who had not as
            yet descried them and little thought of any such danger from the enemy so nigh at hand.
            Being alarmed with this sight, we threw down what sugar we had and ran incontinently to
            meet them, thereby to give our other men time to rally and put themselves into a posture
            of defence. We being in good rank and order, fairly proffered them battle upon the bay ;
            but, as we advanced to meet them, they retired and rode towards the mountains to
            surround us and take the rocks from us, if they possibly could. Hereupon, perceiving
            their intentions, we returned back and possessed ourselves of the said rocks, and also
            of the lower town, as the Spaniards THE BUCCANEERS RETIRE 379 themselves did of the
            upper town (at the distance of half-a- mile from the lower), the hills and the woods
            adjoining thereunto. The horsemen, being now in possession of these jquarters, we could
            perceive as far as we could see more and more men resort to them, so that their forces
            increased hourly to considerable numbers. We fired one at another as long as we could
            reach and the day would permit. But in the meanwhile we observed that several of them
            rode to the watch-hill, and looked out often to the sea-board. This gave us occasion to
            fear that they had more strength and forces coming that way which they expected every
            minute. Hereupon, lest we should speed worse than we had done before, we resolved to
            embark silently in the dark of the night, and go off from the coast where we had been so
            early descried and the enemy was so much prepared against us. We carried off a great
            chest of sugar, whereof we shared seven-pound- weight-and-a-half each man, thirty jars
            of oil, and great plenty of all sorts of garden herbs, roots, and most excellent fruit.
            CHAPTER XIV The Buccaneers depart from the Port of Hilo, and sail to that of Coquimho.
            They are descried before their arrival. Not- withstanding they land ; are encountered by
            the Spaniards ; and put them to flight. They take, plunder, and flre the City of La
            Serena. A description thereof. A stratagem of the Spaniards, in endeavouring to fire
            their ship, discovered and prevented. They are deceived again by the Spaniards, and
            forced to retire from Coquimbo without any ransom for the City or considerable pillage.
            They release several of their chief prisoners The next morning, being Wednesday,
            November 3rd, 1679, about seven o'clock, we set sail from Hilo, standing directly off to
            sea, with a small land-wind. Upon the shore we could not discover this morning above 50
            men of our enemies' forces, which caused us to suspect the rest were run away from their
            colours and had deserted in the dark of the night. If this were so, we were equally
            afraid of each other, and, as we quitted the land being jealous of their multitudes, so
            they abandoned their stations for fear of our encounters. All the while we lay in the
            Port of Hilo, we had a fresh wind, but now, being come out thence, we found it was
            almost stark calm. Hereabouts runs a great sea all along this coast, as we experimented
            at Arica, insomuch that there is no landing except under the favour of some rock or
            other. November 4th, in the morning, we saw the Port of Hilo at E.N.E., at the distance
            of 9 leagues, more or less, from the land. The white sand gives a bright reflection over
            the land, which we could see after we had lost sight of the land itself. The next day to
            this we had an indifferent fresh wind at S.S.E. We reckoned a S.W. half W. way, and, by
            it, that 380 DEPARTURE FROM HILO 381 we had made 20 leagues. Tlie day was very fair and
            sun- shiny and the sea very smooth. November 6th. We had a clear night the last past,
            and the day proved very fair and clear, like the former. We reckoned by a S.W. by W. way
            about 21 leagues. In the afternoon it was almost stark calm. On the following day we had
            in Uke manner very little wind, no more than the last twenty-four hours. We were now
            about this time many of us very much troubled and diseased with the scurvy. It
            proceeded, as we judged, from the great hardship and want of provisions which we had
            endured for several months past, as having had only bread and water, as was mentioned
            above. Only at Hilo we killed a mule, which gave to those who would eat of the flesh a
            very good meal, as we esteemed it, the Spaniards having swept away with them all other
            provisions of flesh. But there we had plundered some small quantity of good choco- late,
            whereof the Spaniards make infinite use. So that now we had each morning a dish of that
            pleasant Uquor, containing almost a pint. Next day likewise we had very little wind, as
            before. We made an observation this day, and found lat. 20° 05' S. November 9th we had
            still very little wind, and that variable. We took almost every hour an observation, and
            found ourselves to be in lat. 20° 18' S. The loth we had in Uke manner but little wind,
            as for so many days before. We observed an E.S.E. current, or nearest to it, to run
            hereabouts. This day we saw the homing of a very high land, which we much admired, for
            at this time I conceived we could not be less than 35 or 40 leagues distant from land.
            We supposed it to be Mora Tarapaca. That day we set up our shrouds. Upon the nth an
            indifferent gale of wind sprang up at S.W. by S., by which we made twenty-five leagues
            and one- third. We had now a great S.S.W. sea. In the night the wind we found came one
            or two points from the land. This morning we saw the like homing of land, whereby we
            were made sensible that it was no land which we had seen the day before. On the i2th we
            had several mists of rain, with windy weather. We made by a S.S.W. half S. way, 25
            leagues and 382 DEPARTURE FROM HILO one-third. We had likewise a great and roUing S.S.W.
            sea, as the day before. The 13th of the said month we had both cloudy and misty weather.
            We made a S.S.W. and one-quarter S. way, by which we ran 50 leagues. But the next day
            fair and clear weather came about again. We had likewise an easy gale of wind, by which
            we made a S.W. way and advanced 22 leagues and-a-half. On November 15th, we had also
            clear weather and an indifferent gale of wind. Our way was S.W. by W., by which we
            reckoned 18 leagues. Likewise that our westing from Hilo, whence we had set forth, was
            114 leagues and one-third. By observation we found lat. 23° 25'. I took now the
            decHnation-table used and made by the cosmographer of Lima. Tuesday, November i6th. Last
            night we had a shower or two of rain. By observation we found lat. 23° 35' S. The 17th
            we made a S.W. by W. half S. way. By observation we found lat. 23° 46' S. with very
            little wind. The i8th upon a S.W. by W. way we made 21 leagues. By observation we found
            lat. 24° 20' S. Friday, November 19th, 1680. This morning about an hour before day we
            observed a comet to appear a degree N. from the bright in Libra. The body thereof seemed
            dull, and its tail extended itself 18 or 20 degrees in length, being of a pale colour
            and pointing directly N.N.W. Our prisoners hereupon reported to us that the Spaniards
            had seen very strange sights, both at Lima, the capital city of Peru, Guaya- quil, and
            other places, much about the time of our coming into the South Seas. I reckoned this day
            we had run 20 leagues by a S.W. way. The day following the appearance of the comet we
            had many storms of wind at S.S.E. and E.S.E. Our reckoning by a S.W. by W. way was 22
            leagues. Sunday, November 21st, we had likewise many gusts of wind, such as the day
            before, with frequent showers of rain. The wind varied to and fro, according as the
            clouds drew it here and there. We reckoned a S.S.W. way, and, by it, 21 leagues and
            a-half. In all, W. from Hilo, we judged ourselves to be 178 leagues and two-thirds. We
            had this day a great DEPARTURE FROM HILO 383 S.W. Sea, and cloudy weather. I supposed
            our latitude to be 26° 53' S. November 22nd we had in like manner cloudy weather, and
            now but little wind. We reckoned a S. way, and 51 leagues. The 23rd we had very little
            wind, all the storm after the appearance of the comet being now quite allayed. We
            reckoned we had made a S.E. by E. way. By observation found lat. 27° 46' S. Wednesday,
            November 24th. All the last twenty-four hours we had a N.W. wind. Our way was S.E. half
            S., by which we reckoned 31 leagues and one-third. The 25th. Last night the wind blew at
            W.S.W., but this morning it came about again at N.W. as the day before. Our reckoning
            this day was a S.E. and one-quarter E. way, 29 leagues and one- third. Lat., by
            observation 39° 57' S. Our difference of meridian 135J. November 26th. In the night the
            wind started to S.S.W., but this day at noon we had little better than a calm. I
            reckoned an E.S.E. half E. way, and, by it, 23 leagues. Saturday, 27th. Yesterday in the
            evening the wind came to S. I reckoned an E. and something S. way, and, by that, 23
            leagues, as the day before this. November 28th. All the last twenty-four hours we
            enjoyed a fresh wind at S.S.E., having a high S.W. sea. Our reckoning was an E. by N.
            and half N. way, and withal 24 leagues. By observation lat. 30° 16' S. and meridian
            distance 88 leagues. At noon the wind came at S. half E. On the 29th we had a very great
            S.W. sea, and withal cloudy weather. My reckoning was by an E. one-third S. way, 20
            leagues and one-third. This day we happened to see two or three great fowls flying in
            the air, concerning which our pilot told us that tliey used to appear 70 or 80 leagues
            off from the island called Juan Fernandez. The day before this Captain Peralta, our
            prisoner, was taken very frantic, his distemper being occasioned, as we thought, through
            too much hardship and melancholy. Notwith- standing, this present day he became
            indifferent^ well again. The following day we had hkewise cloudy weather. We made,
            according to our account, an E. half N. way, and by * See note on p. 87. 384 LA CIUDAD
            DE LA SERENA it 16 leagues and two-thirds. Our meridian difference 52 leagues, December
            ist. We had hazy weather, and withal an indifferent good wind at S., yea, sometimes S.
            by W. Our way was E. by S., by which we reckoned 22 leagues. The night before this day
            we sailed over white water like banks, of a mile in length or more. But these banks,
            upon examina- tion, we found to be only great shoals of anchovies. On December 2nd, very
            early in the morning, we espied land, which appeared to be very high. About noon this
            day we were 6 leagues distance from it. All the preceding night we had so much wind that
            we were forced to make use only of a pair of courses. By an observation made this day,
            we found lat. 30° 35' S. We went away largely, driving better than nine leagues every
            watch. With this wind we made all the sail we possibly could, designing by this means to
            get into Coquimbo, upon which coast we now were, before night. But the wind was so high
            that sometimes we were forced to lower all our sail, it blowing now a mere fret of wind.
            Towards the evening it abated by degrees, insomuch that at midnight it was stark calm
            again. At that time we hoisted out our launch and canoes, and, putting into them 100
            men, we rowed away from the ship with design to take by surprisal a considerable city,
            situated nigh unto the coast, called by the Spaniards La Ciudad de la Serena. Friday,
            December 3rd, 1679. When we departed from the ship, we had above 2 leagues, more or
            less, to row to the shore. But, as it happened, the launch (wherein I was) rowed so
            heavily in comparison to the canoes that we could not keep pace with the said boats. For
            this reason and no other, it was broad day before we got to a certain storehouse
            situated upon the shore, which we found our men had passed by in the dark of the night,
            without perceiving it. They, being landed, immediately marched away from their canoes
            towards the city aforementioned of La Serena, but they had not proceeded far on their
            march when they found, to the great sorrow and chagrin of us all, that we were
            discovered here also, as we had been at the other two places before, to wit Arica and
            Hilo. For, as they marched in a body together being but thirty-five men in all, who were
            all those that were landed out of the canoes, they were suddenly encountered CAPTURE OF
            LA SERENA 385 and engaged by a whole troop of an hundred Spanisli horse. We that were
            behind, hearing the noise of the dispute, followed them at their heels, and made all the
            haste we possibly could to come up to their relief. But, before we could reach the place
            of battle, they had already routed the Spaniards and forced them to fly away towards the
            town. Notwithstanding this rout given to the horse, they rallied again at a distance of
            about a mile from that place, and seemed as if they did wait for us and would engage us
            anew. But, as soon as all our forces were come together, whereof we could make but
            fourscore-and-eight men in all, the rest being left behind to guard the boats, we
            marched towards them and offered them battle. As we came nigh unto them, we clearly
            found they designed no such thing, for they in- stantly retired and rode away before us,
            keeping out of the reach of our guns. We followed them as they rode, being led by them
            designedly clear out of the road that went to the town, that we might not reach nor find
            it so soon. In this engagement with the horse our company had killed three of their
            chief men and wounded four more, killing also four of their horses. When we found that
            we had been led by this stratagem of the enemy out of the way of the town, we left the
            bay and crossed over the green fields to find it, wading oftentimes over several
            branches of water, which there serve to enclose each plot of ground. Upon this march we
            came to several houses, but found them all empty and swept clean both of inhabitants and
            provisions. We saw likewise several horses and other heads of cattle in the fields, as
            we went along towards the City. This place of La Serena our pilot had reported to us to
            be but a small town, but, being arrived there, we found in it no fewer than seven great
            churches and one chapel belonging thereto. Four of these churches were monasteries or
            convents, and each church had its organ for the performance of divine service. Several
            of the houses had their orchards of fruit and gardens belonging to them, both houses and
            gardens being as well and as neatly furnished as those in England. In these gardens we
            found strawberries as big as wahiuts and very delicious to the taste. In a word,
            everything in this city of La Serena was most excellent and delicate, and far beyond
            what we could expect in so remote a place. The town Was inhabited by all sorts of
            tradesmen, 2 c 386 LA SERENA and besides them had its merchants, some of which were
            accounted to be very rich. The inhabitants of La Serena, upon our approach and
            discovery, were all fled, carrying with them whatever was most precious of their goods
            and jewels, or less cumbersome to them. Much of their valuable things they had likewise
            concealed or buried, having had time since we were first discovered so to do. Besides,
            they had had warning enough to beware of us, sent them over land from Arica and several
            other places where we had landed or been descried at sea. Notwithstanding, we took in
            the town one friar and two [fel } ^' Fran au JO ScrivetterT houje JJ Jia^l^U j>Uce J2,

            which adjoins that of Peru, towards the Strait of Magellan. These prisoners related to
            us that the Spaniards, when they heard of our coming, had killed most of the Chihan
            slaves, fearing lest they should run or revolt from them to us. More- over, that we had
            been descried from their coasts four days before our arrival or descent upon land — all
            which time they had employed in carrying away their plate and goods. To this information
            they added that for their defence they had received a supply of 60 men from Arica.
            Having taken possession of the town, that evening there came a negro to us, running away
            from the Spaniards. He likewise informed \is that, when we were before Panama, we had
            taken a negro who was esteemed to be the best pilot in all the South Sea, COQUIMBO 387
            but more especially for this place and all the coasts of Coquim- bo. Moreover, that if
            the Spaniards had not sent all the negroes belonging to this city farther up into the
            country out of our reach and communication, they would all un- doubtedly have revolted
            to us. That night about midnight our boatswain, accompanied by 40 men and having a
            Chilian for their guide, went out of the town some miles within the country, with design
            to find out the places where the Spaniards lay concealed, and had hid their goods and
            plate. But, before they came, the Spaniards had received intelligence thereof from some
            secret spies they had in the town, and both the men and their women were all fled to
            places that were more occult and remote. So that by this search they only found an old
            Indian woman and three children, but no gold nor plate, nor yet any other prisoners.
            This morning our ship came to an anchor, by the storehouse above-mentioned, named
            Tortuga, at the distance of a furlong from shore, in seven fathom water. While we were
            quartered in the town, I took this following ground-plate thereof. The next morning,
            being Saturday, December 4th, there came into the town a flag of truce from the enemy.
            Their message was to proffer a ransom for the town to preserve it from burning, for now
            they began to fear we would set fire to it, as having found no considerable booty or
            pillage therein. The Captains, or chief Commanders, of both sides met about this point,
            and agreed betwixt them for the sum of 95,000 pieces-of-eight to be the price of the
            whole ransom. In the afternoon of this day I was sent down to the bay of Coquimbo, with
            a party of 20 men, to carry thither both goods taken in the town and provisions for the
            ship. It is two-leagues-and-a- half from the town to the port — one league on the bay,
            the rest being a very great road, which leads from the bay to the city. The Spaniards
            promised that the ransom should be collected and paid in by the next day. This day also
            there died one of our negro slaves on board the ship. The following day in the morning I
            returned back to the town with the men I had brought down the day before. Only six of
            them I left behind, to look after our canoes at the end of the bay. When I came up into
            the city, I found that the Spaniards had broken their promise, and had not brought in
            the ransom they had agreed for ; but had begged more 388 A SPANISH STRATAGEM time until
            to-morrow at eight in the forenoon. This evening another party of our men went down to
            the ship, to carry goods, such as we had pillaged in the town. Moreover, that night
            about nine o'clock happened an earthquake, which we were very sensible of, as we were
            all together in the church of San Juan, where our chief rendezvous and corps du garde
            was kept. In the night the Spaniards opened a sluice, and let the water run in streams
            about the town, with intent either to overflow it and thereby force us out of the place,
            or at least that they might the easier quench the flame, in case we should fire the
            town. On the next morning we set fire to the town, perceiving it to be overflowed and
            that the Spaniards had not performed, or rather that they never designed to perform
            their promise. We fired, as nigh as we could, every house in the whole town, to the
            intent it might be totally reduced to ashes. Thus we departed from La Serena, carrying
            with us what plunder we could find, having sent two parties before, loaded with goods to
            the ship, as was mentioned above. As we marched down to the bay, we beat up an ambuscade
            of 250 horse, which lay by the way in private, with an intent to fall on our men, in
            case we had sent down any other party again with goods to the ship. When we came to the
            sea-side, being half-way to our ship, we received advice that the Spaniards had
            endeavoured, by an unusual stratagem, to burn our ship and by these means destroy us
            all. They acted thus : They blew up a horse's hide Hke a bladder, and upon this float a
            man ventured to swim from shore and come under the stern of our ship. Being arrived
            there, he crammed oakum and brimstone, and other combustible matter, between the rudder
            and the stern-post. Having done this, he fired it with a match, so that in a small time
            our rudder was on fire and all the ship in a smoke. Our men both alarmed and amazed with
            this smoke, ran up and down the ship, suspecting the prisoners to have fired the vessel,
            thereby to get their liberty and seek our destruction. At last they found out where the
            fire was, and had the good fortune to quench it before its going too far. As soon as
            they had put it out, they sent the boat ashore, and found both the hide afore- mentioned
            and the match burning at both ends, whereby they became acquainted with the whole
            matter. When RELEASE OF THEIR PRISONERS 389 we came to the storehouse on the shore-side,
            we set at Hberty the friar, our prisoner, and another gentleman who was become our
            hostage for the performance of the ransom. Moreover, when we came aboard, we sent away
            and set at Hberty Captain Peralta, Don Thomas de Argandona, Don Baltazar, Don
            Christoval, Captain Juan, the Pilot's Mate, the old Moor, and several others of our
            chief prisoners. To this release of our prisoners we were moved partly because we knew
            not well what to do with them, and partly because we feared lest by the example of this
            stratagem they should plot our destruction in earnest, and by the help of so many men,
            especially persons of quality, be able to go through with it. CHAPTER XV The Buccaneers

            Three Spanish men-of-war meet with the Buccaneers at the said island, but these outbrave

            was mentioned in the preceding chapter, the next morning, which was Tuesday, December
            7th, twenty of us were sent ashore to observe the motion of the enemy. We went to the
            look-out, or watch-hill, but could learn nothing thence. Hereupon about noon we returned
            on board the ship, and at two in the afternoon we weighed anchor and set sail, directing
            our course for the isle of Juan Fernandez, not far distant from the coast of Coquimbo.
            At night we were five leagues distant thence at N.W. by N. DEPARTURE FROM COQUIMBO 391
            The southermost island of those, which are called De los Paxaros, or the Islands of
            Birds, was then N.N.W. from us. Before our departure I took this draft of the bay of
            Coquimbo and city of La Serena. December 8th we had but very little wind and a lee-ward
            current here, which we perceived did heave us to the North- ward. The aforementioned
            island, De los Paxaros, at three in the afternoon bore N.E. of us. At the distance of 3
            leagues, more or less, it appeared thus : — Isle de los Paxaros It is distant from the
            main continent four leagues, and from the next island of the same name about two. The
            mainland is extremely high and mountainous hereabouts. At evening we were west from the
            said island five leagues. About 8 or 9 leagues to windward of Coquimbo are certain white
            cUffs which appear from the shore to those that are off at sea. On December 9th we had
            likewise but little wind, as the day before. I supposed myself this day to be about
            thirteen leagues W. from the island above-mentioned. The weather was cloudy, with
            mizzling rain, so that no observation could be taken. However, this day it was thought
            convenient to put us to an allowance of water, for we had taken in little or none at
            Coquimbo. The same weather, or very like it, we had the next day, being the 10 th — that
            is to say, stark calm and cloudy. On December nth we had some small rain in the forepart
            of the day. But in the afternoon it cleared up, so that the weather was very hot. We had
            still but httle wind. The next day, December 12th, we had very fair weather, and by a
            clear observation made this day we found lat. 30° 06' S. 392 DEPARTURE FROM COQUIMBO
            December 13th. By a W.S.W. way we made forty-two leagues. By observation we found lat.
            30° 45' S. D.M. 4 leagues and two-thirds. On the 14th, in the morning, we had a handsome
            shower of rain, which continued for some while. Then, about eight o'clock, there sprang
            up a S.S.W. breeze. My reckoning was by an E.S.E. way 14 leagues. And by observation we
            found this day 30° 30' S. In the afternoon of this day died one of our men whose name
            was William Cammock. His disease was occasioned by a surfeit, gained by too much
            drinking on shore at La Serena, which produced in him a calenture, or malignant fever,
            and a hiccough. Thus in the evening we buried him in the sea, according to the usual
            custom of mariners, giving him three French volleys for his funeral. The following day
            we had an indifferent fresh wind on both tacks. Our way was W.S.W., and by it we
            reckoned 34 leagues. So likewise by an observation we had lat. 30° 42' S. All the
            afternoon blew a S. by W. wind very fresh, with a short topping S.W. sea. But on the
            next ensuing day we had no small breeze, but rather hard gusts of wind. These grew so
            high that they forced us to take in our top-sails. We made a S.W. half S. way, and 45
            leagues. On the 17th we had likewise high winds, and withal a S.W. sea. Our way W. by S.
            By observation this day lat. 30° 51' S. In the afternoon we had a S.S.E. wind, our
            course being S.W. December i8th. This day we had the same high winds as before, at
            S.S.E. We reckoned by a W.S.W. way forty-five leagues. At noon the wind was somewhat
            fallen, and then we had some rain. The 19th we had both cloudy and windy weather. My
            reckoning was a S.W. by S. way, and hereupon fifty-eight miles. Yesterday we were
            assured by our pilot that we were now in the meridian of the island of Juan Fernandez,
            whither our course was directed for the present. What occasioned him to be so positive
            in his assertion was the seeing of those great birds of which we made mention in the
            foregoing chapter. On the 20 th we had cloudy weather in the morning on both tacks. We
            made a S.W. and half S. way, and by it 52 leagues. By observation this day lat. 32° 20'
            S. D.M. 123 leagues. ISLAND OF JUAN FERNANDEZ 393 The next day likewise we had cloudy
            weather, yet by observation we found a W. way. On the 22nd by observation we found an E.
            way proved. Thursday, December 23rd. All the night past we had a fresh wind. But, in the
            morning from top-mast head we descried a hummock of land. In the evening we saw it
            again. We found afterwards that what we had seen was the Western- most island of Juan
            Fernandez — which is nothing but a mere rock, there being no riding, nor scarce landing,
            near to it. Friday, December 24th. This morning we could descry the island of Juan
            Fernandez itself S. by E., it being at sixteen leagues distance when we saw it
            yesterday. At .^even this morning the island stood E., the wind being N.W. or by N. At
            eight the same morning the island at the distance of five leagues, little more or less,
            appeared thus : — Isle de Juan Fernandez Here my observation was that I could see
            neither fowl nor fish near this island ; both which things are usually to be seen about
            other islands. Having told my observation to our pilot, he gave me for answer that he
            had made many voyages by this island and yet never saw either fowl or fish any more than
            I. Our reckoning this day was an E.S.E. way, and hereby 36 leagues. By observation lat.
            33° 30' S. Saturday, December 25th. Yesterday, in the afternoon at three o'clock, we saw
            the other island making two or three hummocks of land. This morning we were about eight
            leagues distant from it, the island bearing E.S.E. from us. At eight the same morning we
            were right abreast with it. Here, therefore, are two islands together, the biggest
            whereof is 3 leagues and a-half in length nearest N.W. and S.E., the other (and lesser)
            is almost one league and no more in circum- ference. At ten o'clock we sent off from the
            ship one of our canoes to seek for the best landing and anchoring for our 394 ISLAND OF
            JUAN FERNANDEZ vessel. As we approached, both islands seemed to us nothing but one
            entire heap of rocks. That which Hes more to the N. is the highest, though we could not
            now see the tops thereof for the clouds which covered it. In most places it is so steep
            that it becomes almost perpendicular. This day being Christmas-day, we gave in the
            morning early three volleys of shot for solemnization of that great festival. I reckoned
            an E. by S. way. By a clear observation from the middle of the island lat. 33° 45' S.,
            and M.D. 99 leagues. In the evening of this day we came to an anchor at the South end of
            the island in a stately bay that we found there, but which lies open from the S. to the
            S.E. winds. We anchored in eleven fathom water, and at the distance of only one furlong
            from the shore. Here we saw multitudes of seals covering the bay everywhere, insomuch
            that we were forced to kill them to set our feet on shore. Sunday, December 26th. This
            day we sent a canoe to see if we could find any riding secure from the southerly winds,
            these being the most constant winds that blow on these coasts. The canoe being gone, our
            Commander sent likewise what men we could spare on shore, to drive goats, whereof there
            is great plenty in this island. They caught and killed that day to the number of
            three-score or thereabouts. The canoe, returning to the ship, made report that there was
            good riding in another bay, situate on the North side of the island, in fourteen fathom
            water and not above one- quarter-of-a-mile from the shore. Moreover, that there was much
            wood to be had, whereas in the place where we had first anchored not one stick of wood
            nor tuft of grass was to be found. The next day, being the 27th, between two and four
            o'clock in the morning we had a tempest of violent winds and fierce showers of rain. The
            same day we got in two-hundred jars of water, bringing them the full distance of a
            league from the place of our riding. In the meanwhile others were employed to catch
            goats, as they had done the day before. On the 28th of the said month, in the morning, I
            went with ten more of our company and two canoes, to fetch water from the land. Being
            come thither and having filled our jars, we could not get back to the ship by reason of
            a Southerly WILD-GOATS; A TEMPEST 395 wind that blew from off the ocean and hindered our
            return. Thus we were forced to lie still in a water-hole, and wait till the winds were
            over for a safer opportunity. Meanwhile, the violence of the wind increasing, our ship
            was forced to get under sail and make away, not without danger of being forced ashore.
            Hereupon she sailed out of the harbour, to seek another place of anchoring. At noon I
            ventured out, to try if I could follow the ship, but was forced in again by the wind and
            a raging sea. Thus we lay still for some while longer till the evening came on. This
            being come, we ven- tured out again both canoes together, but the winds were then so
            high that we were forced to throw all our jars of water overboard to lighten our boats —
            otherwise we had inevitably perished. I ought to bless and praise God Almighty for this
            dehverance, for, in all human reason, the least wave of that tempest must have sunk us.
            Notwithstanding, we came that night to our place, or harbour, where we expected to have
            found our ship (called False Wild Harbour) — but found her not. Hereupon, not knowing
            what to do, we went ashore, and hauled up our canoes dry. Having done this, we ascended
            higher within the island, along a guUey, for the space of half-a-mile, there to clear
            ourselves of the noise and company of the seals, which were very troublesome on the
            shore. Here we kindled a fire, dried our clothes, and rested ourselves all night, though
            with extremely hungry bellies, having eaten very little or nothing all the day before.
            In the sides of the hill under which we lay we observed many holes like coney- holes.
            These holes are the nests and roosting-places of multitudes of birds that breed in this
            island — called by the Spaniards pardelas. One of these birds, as we lay drying and
            warming ourselves, fell down into our fire. The next morning being come, very early
            before sunrise we went farther to the northward, to seek for our ship, which we feared
            we had lost. But we were not gone far when we soon spied her at sea. Hereupon we passed
            a point of land and entered a certain bay, which was about a mile deep and not above
            half-a-league over. Into this bay we put, and instantly made a fire, thereby to show the
            ship whereabouts we were. Here we found good watering and wooding close to the shore. In
            this bay also we saw another sort of amphibi- ous animal, which" I imagined to be the
            same that by some 396 SEALS; PARDELAS ; SEA-LIONS authors is called a ' Sea-Lion '^.
            These animals are six times bigger than seals. Their heads are like that of a Hon, and
            they have four fins not unlike a tortoise. The hinder parts of these creatures are much
            like fins, but are drawn after them, being useless upon the shore. They roared as if
            they had been lions, and were full of a certain short and thick hair, which was of a
            mouse colour, but that of the young ones was somewhat lighter. The old ones of these
            sea-lions are between 12 and 14 feet long and about 11 or 12 feet in circumference. A
            seal is very easily killed, as we often experimented, but two of our men with great
            stones could not kill one of these animals. That day in the afternoon there came a canoe
            from on board the ship with provisions for us, they fearing lest we should be starved.
            In like manner the launch came with men to cut wood. They told us that the ship came to
            an anchor in the other bay, but that within half an hour the cable broke, and they were
            forced to leave their anchor behind them and get out to sea again. Night being come, we
            made our beds of fern, whereof there is huge plenty upon this island, together with
            great multitudes of trees like our English box, which bear a sort of green berries,
            smelling like pimento, or pepper. All this day the ship was forced to ply off at sea,
            not being able to get in. December 30 th. The morning of this day we employed in fining
            water and cutting down wood. But in the afternoon eight of us eleven went aboard the
            ship all in one and the same canoe, sending her ashore again with provisions for the men
            that were there. This day in like manner we could not get into the harbour, for no
            sooner the ship came within the parts of land but the wind coming out of the bay blew us
            clear out again. Thus we were forced to ply out all that night and great part of the
            following day. On the next day, having overcome all difficulties and many dangers, we
            came to an anchor in the afternoon in fifteen fathom water, at the distance of a cable's
            length from shore. Here it was observable that we were forced to keep 1 Probably the
            seal, Otaria jubata, of the Pacific Ocean, which has a large crest or mane, on its neck.
            Cf. Dampier, Voyages (1697), ed. 1729, i, 90 : " The Sea Lion is a large creature about
            12 or 14 foot long." It must not be confused with the walrus, as is frequently done.
            WINDY WEATHER 397 men ashore on purpose to beat off the seals, while our men filled
            water at the sea-side, at high-water mark, for the seals covet hugely to lie in fresh
            water. About this island fish is so plentiful that in less than one hour's time two men
            caught enough for our whole company. Saturday, January ist, 1681. This day we put up a
            new main-top, larger than the old one, and we caught cray-fish that were bigger than our
            English lobsters. The next day, being January 2nd, died a chief man of our company,
            whose name was John Milliard. This man, until our weighing anchor from the port of
            Coquimbo, had been our Master all the space of this voyage. But from that time we chose
            John Cox for the starboard, and John Fall for the larboard, watch. The disease whereof
            he died was the dropsy. That evening we buried our dead companion, and gave him a volley
            for his funeral, according to the usual custom. On January 3rd we had terrible gusts of
            wind from the shore every hour. This day our pilot told us that many years ago a certain
            ship was cast away upon this island, and only one man saved, who lived alone upon the
            island five years before any ship came this way to carry him off. The island has
            excellent land in many valleys belonging thereunto. This day, likewise, we fetched our
            anchor which we left in the other bay when the ship broke her cable. Tuesday, January
            4th, 1681. This day we had such terrible flaws of wind that the cable of our ship broke,
            and we had undoubtedly been on shore had not the other held us fast. At last it came
            home, and we drove outward. By the way it caught hold of a rock, and held some time, but
            at last we hauled it up, and the wind came with so much violence that the waves flew as
            high as our main-top and made all the water of a foam. January 5th the same huge gusts
            of wind continued all the night last past, notwithstanding which this day at noon it was
            brave and calm. But in the morning the anchor of our ship gave way again, and we drove
            to the Eastward more than half-a-mile, till at last we happened to fasten again in 60
            fathom water. Here in this bay where we rode at anchor did run a violent current,
            sometimes into and at other times out of the bay, so that all was uncertain with us. But
            our 398 MUTINY AMONG THE BUCCANEERS greatest discomfort was that our men were all in a
            mutiny against each other, and much divided among themselves, some of them being for
            going home towards England or our foreign plantations, and that round about America
            through the Strait of Magellan, as Captain Sawkins had designed to do ; others of them
            being for staying longer and searching farther into those seas till such time as they
            had got more money. This day at noon our anchor drove again, whereupon, to secure
            ourselves from that dangerous place, we sailed thence into the West bay, anchored there
            in twenty-five fathom water, and moored our ship one-quarter-of-a-mile from shore. On
            Thursday, January 6th, our differences being now grown to a great height, the mutineers
            made a new election of another person to be our chief Captain and Commander, by virtue
            whereof they deposed Captain Sharp, whom they protested they would obey no longer. They
            chose therefore one of our company whose name was John WatUng, to command in chief, he
            having been an old privateer and gained the esteem of being a stout seaman. The election
            being made, all the rest were forced to give their assent to it, and Captain Sharp gave
            over his command, whereupon they immediately made articles with Watling, and signed
            them. The following day, being the 7th, we burnt and tallowed the starboard side of our
            ship. In this bay where we now anchored we found a cross cut in the bark of a tree and
            several letters besides. Hereupon, in another tree up the guUey, I engraved the two
            first letters of my name, with a cross over them. This day, likewise, William Cook,
            servant to Captain Edmund Cook, being searched, we found a paper with all our names
            written in it, which it was suspected he designed to have given to the Spanish
            prisoners. For these reasons this evening our Captain thought it convenient to put him
            in irons, which was accordingly done. The next day we finished the other side of our
            ship. Sunday, January 9th. This day was the first Sunday that ever we kept by command
            and common consent since the loss and death of our valiant commander, Captain Saw- kins.
            This generous-spirited man threw the dice overboard, finding them in use on the said
            day. SPANISH MEN-OF-WAR 399 January 10 th. This day the weather was very clear and
            settled again. We caught every day in the bay where we now were great plenty of fish,
            and I saw the same day a shoal of fish a mile and more long. On the next day, being the
            nth, we filled our water and carried our wood on board the ship. Moreover, our two
            canoes went to the other side of the island to catch goats, for on the barren side
            thereof are found and caught the best, and by land it is impossible to go from one side
            of the island to the other. Wednesday, January 12th. This morning our canoes returned
            from catching goats, firing guns as they came towards us to give us warning. Being come
            on board, they told us they had espied three sail of ships, which they con- ceived to be
            men-of-war, coming about the island. Within half-an-hour after this notice given by our
            boats, the ships came in sight to leeward of the island. Hereupon we immedi- ately
            slipped our cables and put to sea, taking all our men on board that were ashore at that
            time. Only one, William, a Mosquito Indian, was then left behind on the island, because
            he could not be found at this our sudden departure. Upon the Island of Juan Fernandez
            grow certain trees that are called by the name of bilby-trees. The tops of these trees
            are excellent cabbage, and of them is made the same use that we do of cabbage in
            England. Here fish abound in such quantity that on the surface of the water I have taken
            fish with a bare and naked hook, that is to say unbaited. Much fish is taken here of the
            weight of twenty pounds, the smallest that is taken in the bay being almost two pound
            weight. Very good timber for building of houses and other uses is hkewise found upon the
            island. It is distant from the main continent ninety-five leagues or thereabouts, being
            situate in 33° 40' S.. The plats of the island lie N.W. and S.E. Being got out of the
            bay, we stood off to sea, and kept to windward as close as we could. The biggest of
            these Spanish men-of-war, for such they proved to be, was of the burden of 800 tons, and
            was called El Santo Christo, being mounted with twelve guns. The second, named San
            Francisco, was of the port of 600 tons, and had ten guns. The third was of the carriage
            of 350 tons, whose name I have forgotten. As soon as they saw us, they instantly put out
            their bloody 400 ISLAND OF JUAN FERNANDEZ flags, and we, to show them that we were not
            as yet daunted, did the same with ours. We kept close under the wind, and were, to
            confess the truth, very unwilUng to fight them, by reason they kept all in a knot
            together and we could not single out any one of them or separate him from the rest —
            especially considering that our present Commander, Watling, had showed himself at their
            appearance to be faint-hearted. As for the Spaniards themselves, they might have easily
            come to us, since we lay by several times, but undoubtedly they were cowardly given, and
            peradventure as unwilling to engage us as we were to engage them. The following day,
            being January 13th, in the morning we could descry one of the forementioned men-of-war
            under the leeward side of the island, and we beheved that the rest were at anchor
            thereabouts. At W. by S. and at the distance of seven leagues the island appeared thus :
            — Isle of Juan Fernandez LAT. 33'' 40' S. At noon that day we stood towards the island,
            making as if that we intended to be in with them. But in the afternoon our Commander
            propounded the question to us whether we were wiUing now that the fleet was to windward,
            to bear away from them. To this we all agreed with one consent. And hereupon, night
            being come, with a fresh wind at S.S.E. we stood away N.E. by N., and thus gave them
            handsomely the sUp, after having outbraved them that day and the day before. CHAPTER XVI
            TAe Buccaneers depart from the isle of Juan Fernandez to thai of Iquique. Here they take
            several prisoners, and learn intelli- gence of the posture of affairs at Arica. Cruelty
            committed upon one of the said prisoners who had rightly informed them. They attempt
            Arica the second time, and take the town, hut are beaten out of it again before they
            could plunder — with great loss of men, many of them being killed, wounded^ and made
            prisoners. Captain Waiting, their chief Com- mander, is killed in this attack, and
            Captain Sharp presently chosen again, who leads them off, and through mountains of
            difficulties makes a bold retreat to the ship Having* bid our enemies adieu, after the
            manner as was said in the preceding chapter, the next morning, being January 14th, we
            bore N.E. We reckoned this day a N.N.E. one quarter S. way, and by it 30 leagues. We
            were four leagues E. from the island of Juan Fernandez, when I took our departure.
            Saturday, January 15th, we had hazy weather. This day we made by a N.E. by N. way 11
            leagues. The same hazy weather continued in like manner the i6th. But about ten 401 402
            DEPART FROM JUAN FERNANDEZ that nxorning the wind died away. Our reckoning was a N.E. by
            N. way, and 36 leagues. On the 17th we had a soft gale, and a clear observation. We
            found by it lat. 28° 47' S. easting 70 leagues. The next day we had likewise a clear
            day, and we reckoned by a N.E. by N. way 31 leagues. By observation lat. 27° 29' S.
            Wednesday, January 19th, we had a clear day, as before, and reckoned a N.E. by N. way,
            and 35 leagues and two- thirds. By observation we took lat. 25° 00' S. This day we put
            up our top-gallant masts and sails, which we had taken down at the island of Juan
            Fernandez, when we thought to have gone directly thence for the Strait of Magellan. But
            now our resolutions were changed, and our course was bent for Arica, that rich place,
            the second time, to try what good we could do upon it by another attempt, in order to
            make all our fortunes there. In the evening of this day we saw land at a great distance.
            January 20th, about midnight, we had a small land-wind that sprang up and reached us. At
            break of day we could descry land again, at the distance of 9 or 10 leagues, more or
            less. This day was very hot and calm, easting 92 leagues. On the 2ist we had very little
            wind, and all along as we went we could descry high land, and that barren. We sailed N.
            by E., and N.N.E. along the coast of the continent. The next day being Saturday, January
            22nd, we had very hot weather. This day we sailed N. and N. by E., and looked out
            continually for the island of Iquique, which our pilot told us was hereabouts. We kept
            at a just distance from land for fear of being descried by the enemy. On the following
            day, Sunday, 23rd, we sailed in like manner N.N.E. along the coast, which seems to be
            very full of bays hereabouts. By observation this day we took lat. 21° 49' S. Monday,
            January 24th. This day we had an indifferent gale of wind, and we stood N. and by E.,
            the wind being S.S.E. By observation lat. 21° 02' S. Our whole easting I reckoned to be
            92 leagues and a-half. In the afternoon of this day Captain Wathng, our Commander, and
            25 men more departed from the ship in two canoes, with design to seek for and take the
            island of Iquique, and there to gain intelligence of the posture of affairs at Arica. We
            were at THE ISLAND OF IQUIQUE 403 the distance of twelve leagues from shore when they
            went away from the ship. The next day by a clear observation lat. 20° 40' S. At four in
            the afternoon this day one of our canoes returned, bringing word that they could not
            find the island, though they had searched for it very diligently. At night came the
            other, being brought back by a wrong sign given us by the first canoe. This second canoe
            had landed upon the continent, and there found a track, which they followed for some
            Httle space. Here they met a dead whale, with whose bones the Spaniards had built a hut,
            and set up a cross. There lay also many pieces of broken jars. They observed likewise
            that hereabouts upon the coast were many bays, good landings, and anchoring for ships.
            That evening, about seven o'clock, a fresh gang departed from the ship to seek for the
            same island, while we lay becalmed all night, driving about a league to leeward.
            Wednesday, January 26th, we had extremely hot weather. This day the Spanish pilot told
            us that on the continent over against us, and at the distance of a very little way
            within the land, are many rich mines of silver, but that the Spaniards dared not open
            them for fear of an invasion from some foreign enemy or other. We sailed N., at the
            distance of about 2 leagues from shore. At noon by observation found lat. 20° 21' S. At
            four o'clock we saw a smoke made by our men, close by a white cliff, which proved to be
            the island. Hereupon we immediately sent away another canoe with more men, to supply
            them in their attempts. But in the meanwhile the first canoe, which had departed the
            evening before this day, came aboard, bringing with them four prisoners, two old white
            men and two Indians. The other canoe, which set out last, brought back molasses, fish,
            and two jars of wine. To windward of the said island is a small village of eighteen or
            twenty houses, having a small chapel near it built of stone, and for adornment thereof
            it is stuck full of hides or the skins of seals. They found about 50 people in this
            hamlet, but the greatest part of them made their escape at the arrival of the canoe. To
            this island fre- quently come barks from Arica, which city is not far distant, to fetch
            clay, and they have aheady transported away a considerable part thereof. The poor
            Indians, inhabitants 404 MURDER OP AN OLD INDIAN or natives of this island, are forced
            to bring all the fresh water they use the full distance of eleven leagues, that is to
            say from a river named Camarones, which lies to leeward of the island. The barque
            wherein they used to bring it was gone for water when our men landed upon the place. The
            island all over is white, but the bowels thereof are of a reddish sort of earth. From
            the shore is seen here a great path which leads over the mountains into the country. The
            Indians of' this island eat much and often a sort of leaves that are of a taste much
            like our bay-leaves in England, insomuch that their teeth are dyed a green colour by the
            continual use of it. The inhabitants go stark naked, and are very robust and strong
            people, yet notwithstanding they live more like beasts than men. Thursday, January 27th.
            This morning on board the ship we examined one of the old men who were taken prisoners
            upon the island the day before. But, finding him in many lies, as we thought, concerning
            Arica, our Commander ordered him to be shot to death, which was accordingly done. Our
            old Commander, Captain Sharp, was much troubled in his mind and dissatisfied at this
            cruel and rash proceeding, whereupon he opposed it as much as he could. But, seeing he
            could not prevail, he took water and washed his hands, saying : Gentlemen, I am clear of
            the blood of this old man ; and I will warrant you a hot day for this piece of cruelty,
            when- ever we come to fight at Arica. These words were found at the latter end of this
            expedition of Arica to contain a true and certain prophecy, as shall be related
            hereafter. The other old man, being under examination, informed us that the island of
            Iquique aforementioned belonged to the Governor of Arica, who was proprietor thereof ;
            and that he allowed these men a little wine and other necessaries, to live upon for
            their sustenance. That he himself had the superintendence of forty or fifty of the
            governor's slaves, who caught fish and dried it for the profit of the said governor, and
            he sold it afterwards to the inland towns, and reaped a considerable benefit thereby.
            That by a letter received from Arica eight days ago they understood there was then in
            the harbour of Arica three ships from Chile, and one bark. That they had raised there a
            fortification mounted with 12 copper guns. But that when we were there before, they
            OTHER OLD INDIAN'S RELATION 405 had conveyed out of the town to the neighbouring
            stations all their plate, gold, and jewels, burying it there in the ground and
            concealing it after several manners and ways, which, whether it were now returned or
            not, he could not easily tell. That there were two great places, the one at ten, the
            other at twenty-five, leagues distance from Arica, at which towns lay all their strength
            and treasure. That the day before had passed a post to declare our having been at
            Coquim- bo. That the embargo laid on all vessels going northward was now taken off, so
            that a free passage was allowed them. That by land it was impossible to go hence to
            Arica in less than four or five days, forasmuch as they must carry water for themselves
            and horses for the whole journey. And, lastly, that those arms that were brought from
            Lima to Arica, as was mentioned above, were now carried away to Buenos Ayres. All these
            things pleased us mighty well to hear. But, however. Captain Sharp was still much
            dissatisfied because we had shot the old man. For he had given us information to the
            full, and, with all manner of truth, how that Arica was greatly fortified, and much more
            than before ; but our misfortune was that we took his information to be all contrary to
            the truth. The leaves of which we made mention above are brought down to this island in
            whole bales, and then distributed to the Indians by a short allowance given to each man.
            This day we had very hot weather, and a S.W. sea. By observa- tion we found lat. 20° 13'
            S. Besides the things above- mentioned, our prisoners informed us that at Arica the
            Spaniards had built a breastwork round about the town, and one also in every street,
            that, in case one end of the town were taken, they might be able to defend the other. We
            stood off and on for the greatest part of this day. In the afternoon we were 8 leagues
            and a-half distant from shore, with a fresh wind. That morning, moreover, we took the
            bark that was at the river of Camarones, to fill water for the island. Friday, January
            28th. Last night about midnight we left the ship, and embarked ourselves in the bark
            aforementioned, the launch, and four canoes, with design to take Arica by surprise. We
            rowed and sailed all night, making in for the shore. 4o6 THE ATTACK ON ARICA Saturday,
            January 29th. About break of day we got under shore, and there hid ourselves among the
            rocks for all the day long, fearing lest we should be descried by the enemy before we
            came to Arica. At this time we were about 5 leagues to southward of Arica, near Quebrada
            de San Vitor, a place so-called upon that coast. Night being come, we rowed away from
            there. Sunday, January 30th, 1680. This day (being the day that is consecrated in our
            English Calendar to the Martjn-dom of our glorious King Charles the First) in the
            morning about sunrise, we landed amongst some rocks at some distance of 4 miles, more or
            less, to the southward from Arica. We put on shore 92 men in all, the rest remaining in
            the boats to keep and defend them from being surprised by the enemy, with the intent we
            might leave behind us a safe retreat in case of necessity. To these men we left strict
            orders that, if we made one smoke from the town or adjoining fields, they should come
            after us towards the harbour of Arica with one canoe ; but, in case we made two, that
            they should bring all away, leaving only 15 men in the boats. As we marched from our
            landing-place towards the town, we mounted a very steep hill, and saw thence no men nor
            forces of the enemy ; which caused us to hope we were not as yet descried, and that we
            should utterly surprise them. But, when we were come about half of the way to the town,
            we spied three horsemen, who mounted the look-out hill ; and, seeing us upon our march,
            they rode down full-speed towards the city, to give notice of our approach. Our
            Commander, Watling, chose out 40 of our number to attack the fort, and sent us away
            first thitherwards, the rest being designed for the town. We that were appointed for the
            fort had ten hand grenades among us when we gave the assault, and with them, as well as
            with our other arms, we attacked the castle, and exchanged several shot with our
            enemies. But at last, seeing our main body in danger of being overborne with the number
            of our enemies, we gave over that attempt on the fort, and ran down in all haste to the
            valley, to help and assist them in the fight. Here the battle was very desperate, and
            they killed three and wounded two more of our men from their out-works, before we could
            gain upon them. But, our rage increasing with our wounds, we still advanced, and THE
            ATTACK ON ARICA 407 at last beat the enemy out of all, and filled every street in the
            city with dead bodies. The enemy made several retreats to several places, from one
            breastwork to another ; and we had not a sufficient number of men wherewith to man all
            places taken. Insomuch that we had no sooner beat them out of one place than they came
            another way, and manned it again with new forces and fresh men. We took in every place
            where we vanquished the enemy great number of prisoners, more indeed than peradventure
            we ought to have done or knew well what to do with ; they being too many for such a
            small body as ours was to manage. These prisoners informed us that we had been descried
            no less than three days before from the island of Iquique, whereby they were in
            expectation of our arrival every hour, knowing we still had a design to make a second
            attempt upon that place. That into the city were come 400 soldiers from Lima, who,
            besides their own, had brought 700 arms for the use of the country-people ; and that in
            the town they had 600 armed men, and in the fort 300. Being now in possession of the
            city, or the greatest part thereof, we sent to the fort, commanding them to surrender ;
            but they would not vouchsafe to send us any answer. Here- upon we advanced towards it,
            and gave it a second attack, wherein we persisted very vigorously for a long time. Not
            being able to carry it, we got upon the top of a house that stood near it, and from
            there fired down into the fort, killing many of their men and wounding them at our ease
            and pleasure. But, while we were busied in this attack, the rest of the enemy's forces
            had taken again several posts of the town, and began to surround us in great numbers,
            with design to cut us off. Hereupon we were constrained to desist the second time as
            before from assaulting the fort, and make head against them. This we no sooner had done
            than, their numbers and vigour increasing every moment, we found ourselves to be
            overpowered, and consequently we thought it convenient to retreat to the place where our
            wounded men were, under the hands of our surgeons, that is to say our Hospital. At this
            time our new Commander, Captain Watling, both our quartermasters, and a great many
            others of our men were killed, besides those that were wounded and dis- abled. So that
            now, the enemy rallying against us and 4o8 DEFEAT OF THE BUCCANEERS beating us from
            place to place, we were in a very distracted condition, and in more likelihood to perish
            every man than escape the bloodiness of that day. Now we found the words of Captain
            Sharp to bear a true prophecy, being all very sensible that we had had a day too hot for
            us, after that cruel heat in killing and murdering in cold blood the old Mestizo Indian
            whom we had taken prisoner at Iquique, as before was mentioned. Being surrounded with
            difficulties on all sides and in great disorder, having no head or leader to give orders
            for what was to be done, we were glad to turn our eyes to our good and old Commander,
            Captain Bartholomew Sharp, and beg of him very earnestly to commiserate our condition
            and carry us off. It was a great while that we were reiterating our supplications to him
            before he would take any notice of our request in this point, so much was he displeased
            with the former mutiny of our people against him, all which had been occasioned by the
            instigation of Mr Cook. But Sharp is a man of an undaunted courage and of an excellent
            conduct, not fearing in the least to look an insulting enemy in the face, and a person
            that knows both the theory and practical parts of navigation as well as most do.
            Hereupon, at our request and earnest petition, he took upon him the Command-in- chief
            again, and began to distribute his orders for our safety. He would have brought off our
            surgeons, but that they had been drinking while we assaulted the fort, and thus would
            not come with us when they were called. They killed and took of our number 28 men — 18
            more that we brought off were desperately wounded. At this time we were extremely faint
            for want of water and victuals, whereof we had had none all that day. Moreover, we were
            almost choked with the dust of the town, this being so much raised by the work that
            their great guns had made that we could scarcely see each other. They beat us out of the
            town, and then followed us into the Savannas, or open fields, still charging us as fast
            as they could. But when they saw that we ralHed again, resolving to die one by another,
            they then ran from us into the town, and sheltered themselves under their breastworks.
            Thus we retreated in as good order as we could possibly observe in that confusion. But
            their horsemen followed us as we retired, and fired at us all the way, though they
            FLIGHT OF THE BUCCANEERS 409 would not come within reach of our guns, for their own
            reached farther than ours, and outshot us more than one- third. We took the sea-side for
            our greater security ; which, when the enemy saw, they betook themselves to the hills,
            rolling down great stones and whole rocks to destroy us. In the meanwhile those of the
            town examined our surgeons and other men whom they had made prisoners. These gave them
            our signs that we had left to our boats that were behind us, so that they immediately
            blew up two smokes, which were perceived by the canoes. This was the greatest of our
            dangers. For, had we not come at the instant that we did to the sea-side, our boats had
            been gone, they being already under sail, and we had inevitably perished every man. Thus
            we put off from the shore, and got on board about ten o'clock at night, having been
            involved in a continual and bloody fight with the enemy all that day long. CHAPTER XVII

            provisions. A draft of the said port. They land again at Hilo to revenge the former
            affronts, and take what they could find Having ended our attempt at Arica, the next day,
            being January the last, we phed to and fro in sight of the port, to see if they would
            send out the three ships we had seen in the harbour to fight us. For upon them we hoped
            to revenge the defeat and disappointment we had received at the town the day before. But
            our expectations in this point also were frustrated, for not one of those vessels
            offered to stir. liio J^€^n'ca. -Td^eJti*'^'^'^' Gx7 dejcrwtion o/Anca The houses of
            this town of Arica are not above eleven-feet high, being built of earth and not of brick
            or timber. The town itself is four-square in figure, and at one corner stands the
            castle, which may easily be commanded even with small arms from the hill which Hes close
            to it. This place is the emharcadero, or port-town, of all the mineral towns that lie
            hereabouts, and hence is fetched all the plate that is carried to Lima, the head city of
            Peru. I took the bay of Arica as it appeared to me. 410 DEPARTURE FROM ARICA 411 On
            Tuesday, February ist, we had a clear observation, and by it we found lat. 19° 06' S.
            This day we shared the old remains of our plate, taken in some of our former booties.
            Our shares amounted only to 37 pieces-of-eight to each man. N.B. — Here I would have my
            reader take notice thai from this day forward I kept no co^istant Diary or Journal as I
            had done before, at least for some considerable space of time, as you see hereafter — my
            disease and sickness at sea being the occasion of ifitermitting what I had never failed
            to do in all the course of this voyage till now. Only some few memorandums as my
            weakness gave leave I now and then committed to paper, which I shall give you as I find
            them, towards a continuance of this history. Thus : — Monday, February 14th. This night
            between eleven and twelve o'clock died on board our ship William Cook, who was the
            servant aforementioned to Captain Edmund Cook, of whom Ukewise mention has been often
            made in this Journal. February i6th, 1680. This day we found ourselves to be in lat. 27°
            30' S. We had a constant breeze at S.E. and S.S.E. till we got about 200 leagues from
            land. Then, at the ecHpse of the moon, we had a calm for two or three days ; and then a
            breeze at N. for the space of two days ; after which we had a calm again for two or
            three days more. March ist. By observation, lat. 34° 01' S. At this time begins the
            dirty weather in these seas. We lay under a pair of courses, the wind being at S.E. and
            E.S.E., with a very great sea at S.S.E. March 3rd. All hands were called up, and a
            council held ; wherein, considering it was now dirty weather and late in the year, we
            bore up the helm and resolved to go to the main for water, and thence to leeward, and so
            march overland towards home or at least to the North Sea. But God directed us from
            following this resolution, as you shall hear hereafter. We being thus determined that
            day, we stood N.E. with a strong wind at S.E. and E.S.E. On March 5th died our Coquimbo
            Indian. The seventh we had a West-wind, our course being E. by N. The eighth of the said
            month we were put to an allowance, having only one cake of bread a day. March 10 th, we
            had a strong South- wind. 412 THE PORT OF GUASCO On March 12th we fell in with the
            mainland, somewhat to leeward of Coquimbo. Within the island of Paxaros are double
            lands, in whose valleys are fires for the melting of copper, with which metal these
            hills abound. Off to sea- board it is a rocky land, and within it is sandy. About the
            distance of eight leagues to leeward is a rocky point with several quays or rocks about
            it. About one half-mile to leeward of this point turns in the port of Guasco. Right
            against the anchoring are three rocks, close under the shore. C2^ (fDe/cnfU^^ Guasco
            ^(fua^u iff* *l. 4»/ Being arrived here, we landed on shore three-score men of our
            company, with design to get provisions and anything else that we could purchase. The
            people of the country all ran away as soon as they saw us. There was building on shore
            in this port a fire-bark of 16 or 18 tons burden, with a cock-boat belonging to it. We
            took one Indian prisoner, and with him went up the space of six or seven miles into the
            country to an Indian town of three-score or four-score houses. Thence we came back to
            the church, which is distant four miles from the sea-side ; and lodged there all night.
            Here are multitudes of good sheep and goats in the country adjoining this port, and it
            is watered with an excellent fresh- water river ; but the getting of the water is very
            difficult, the banks being very high or otherwise inaccessible. How- ever, we made a
            shift to get in 500 jars of water. Furthermore, we brought away 120 sheep and four-score
            goats, with which stock we victualled our vessel for a while. As for oxen. MORO DE HORSE
            413 they had driven them away farther up into the country. The jurisdiction of Guasco
            itself is governed by a Tenente, or Deputy-Governor, and a Friar, and is in subjection
            to the city of La Serena above-mentioned, being a dependence upon it. Here grows corn,
            peas, beans, and several other sorts of grain ; and for fruits this place is not
            inferior to Coquimbo. Here we found likewise a mill to grind corn, and about 200 bushels
            thereof ready ground, which we conveyed on board our ship. Every house of any account
            has branches of water running through its yards or courts. The inhabitants had hidden
            their wine and other best things, as plate and jewels, having descried us at sea before
            our landing — so that our booty here, besides provisions, was inconsiderable. How- ever,
            we caught some few fowls, and eat five or six sheep, and likewise a great hog, which
            tasted very like our EngUsh pork. The hills are all barren, so that the country which
            bears fruit is only an excellent valley, being four times as broad as that of Hilo
            above-mentioned. These people of Guasco serve the town of Coquimbo with many sorts of
            provisions. We gave the Indian whom we had taken his liberty, and I took the port of
            Guasco. Tuesday, March 15th, 1680. This morning we departed from the port of Guasco
            aforementioned, with very little wind, having done nothing considerable there, excepting
            only the taking in the few provisions above-related. We were bent therefore to seek
            greater matters, having experienced but ill success in most of our attempts hitherto. On
            March 20 th, Moro de Horse, being high doubled land, and at E. by N. appeared thus to
            us, in lat. 24° S. : — Moro de Horse At N., and at the distance of ten leagues, more or
            less, we saw the great and high hill of Moro Moreno, being so called 414 MORO MORENO
            from its colour. It is a dark hill, but much higher and bigger than the other
            aforementioned, and appears Uke an island, thus : — MoRO Moreno We had now very dark
            weather all along the coast. On March 21st we were W. from the bay of Mexillones. The
            point of this bay one league upwards represents exactly a sugar-loaf. March 22nd. This
            day our boat and canoes went from the ship, well manned, to find the river Loa. They
            went also about two leagues to leeward of it, to a fishing village, but could find no
            place fit for landing ; whereupon they returned without doing anything. The next day
            another canoe of our company went out upon the same exploit, but found the same success.
            Yet, notwithstanding, here Sir Francis Drake watered, and built a church, as we were
            told by our pilot. This church is now standing on the sea-side by the river, whose mouth
            is now dry. There are several huts to windward of it ; and from the said church or
            chapel a great path goes up the hills ; which leads to Pica. On Thursday, March 24th, by
            observation lat. 20° 10' S. This day also we saw land at 18 leagues distance, more or
            less. Sunday, March 27th, we saw Mora de Sama and Lacumba at some distance. The same day
            we had an observation, and found by it lat. 18° 17' S. That evening we departed from the
            ship with our boats and canoes towards the coast of Hilo, upon which we now were. We
            landed and took the village of Hilo undescried, they scarce suspecting we could have any
            design upon that place the second time. We caught the friar who was chaplain to the
            town, and most of the inhabitants, asleep, making them prisoners-of-war. Here we heard a
            flying report that 5000 English had lately taken Panama the second time, and kept it.
            But this rumour, as it should seem, proved to be a falsity. At this time the river came
            out, and was overflowed, it being near the time of the freshes. Here the prisoners told
            us that in Arica ten CAPTURE OF HILO 415 of our men were still alive, whereof three were
            surgeons, all the rest being dead of their wounds. The Spaniards sent word to Hilo that
            we had killed 70 men and wounded three times as many of their forces. Here the
            inhabitants said that of 45 men sent to the relief of Arica from hence there came home
            but only two alive. We filled what water we pleased here, but a small boat that we
            brought from Guasco broke loose from us and was staved to pieces on the rocks. Here we
            took 18 jars of wine, and good store of new figs. On Tuesday following we went up to the
            sugar-works mentioned in our former expedition against Hilo, and found all fruits just
            ripe and fit for eating. There we laded seven mules downwards with molasses and sugar.
            The inhabitants told us, moreover, that those who came to fight us when we were here the
            first time were most of them boys, and had only 50 firearms amongst them, they being
            commanded by an English gentleman who is married at Arequipa. Likewise, that the owner
            of the sugar-works aforementioned was now engaged in a suit-at-law against the town of
            Hilo, pretending it was not the Enghsh who robbed him and spoilt his ingenio, when we
            were there before, but the townsmen themselves. This day in the evening we sailed from
            Hilo with dark weather and Uttle wind, which continued for several days afterwards.
            CHAPTER XVIII They depart from the Port of Hilo to the Gulf of Nicoya, where they take
            down their decks and mend the sailing of their ship. Forty-seven of their companions
            leave them, and go home overland. A description of the Gulf of Nicoya. They take two
            harks and some prisoners there. Several other remarks belonging to this voyage From the
            time that we set sail from the port of Hilo until Sunday, April loth, 1681, nothing
            happened to us that might be accounted remarkable ; neither did I take any notes all
            this while, by reason of my indisposition aforementioned. This day we could hear
            distinctly the breaking of the seas on the shore, but could see no land, the weather
            being ex- tremely dark and hazy. Notwithstanding, about noon it cleared up, and we found
            ourselves to be in the bay called De Malabrigo. The land in this bay runs due E. and W.
            By an observation made, we found this day 6° 35' S. We saw from here the leeward island
            of Lobos, or Seals, being nothing but a rocky and scraggy place. On the S.W. side
            thereof is a red hill, which is a place about the said island which the Indian fishermen
            much frequent. It is situated in lat. 6° 15' S. This day likewise in the evening we saw
            the point called Aguja. On Saturday, April i6th, we came within a league distance of the
            West-end of the island of Plate, above described. The next day to this, being Sunday,
            April 17th, 1681, our mutineers broke out again into an open dissension, they having
            been much dissatisfied all along the course of this voyage, but more especially since
            our unfortunate fight at Arica, and never entirely reconciled to us since they chose
            Captain Watling and deposed Sharp at the isle of Juan Fernandez, as was related above.
            Nothing now could appease 416 CAPTURE OF BONITOS 4I7 them nor serve their turn but a
            separation from the rest of the company and a departure from us. Hereupon this day they
            departed from the ship, to the number of 47 men, all in company together, with design to
            go overland by the same way they came into those seas. The rest who remained behind did
            fully resolve and faithfully promise to each other they would stick close together. They
            took five slaves in their company, to guide and do them other service in that journey.
            This day we had lat. 1° 30' S. We sailed N.N.W. before the wind. The next day after
            their departure, being April i8th, we began to go to work about taking down one of our
            upper decks, thereby to cause our ship still to mend her sailing. We now made a N.W. by
            N. way, by observation lat. 25° N., the wind being at S.W. On April 19th we made a N.W.
            by N. way. By observation lat. 2° 45' N. In the afternoon we had cloudy weather. The
            following day likewise we made the same way, and by it 70 miles, according to my
            reckoning. On the 2 1st in the morning we had some small showers of rain, and but little
            wind. We saw some turtle upon the surface of the water, and great quantity of fish. We
            caught twenty-six small dolphins. By a N.W. by N. way, we reckoned this day forty miles.
            April 22nd. This day we caught seven large dolphins and one bonito. We saw likewise
            whole multitudes of turtle swimming upon the water, and took five of them. By observa-
            tion lat. 5° 28' N. Hereabouts runs a great and strong current. This day we lowered the
            quarter-deck of our ship, and made it even to the upper deck. The following day we had
            but small wind, and yet great showers of rain. Hereupon every man saved water for him-
            self, and a great quantity was saved for the whole company. In the morning of this day
            we caught eight bonitos, and in the evening ten more. On April 24th we had both cloudy
            and rainy weather. By observation lat. 7° 37' N. ; M.D. 92 leagues. This morning we
            caught forty bonitos, and in the evening thirty more. In the afternoon we stood N., the
            wind being at S.W. by S. Monday, April 25th. All the night before this day we had huge
            gusts of wind and rain. At break of day we were 41 8 THE ISLAND OF CANO close in with
            land, which upon examination proved to be the island of Cano. To westward thereof is
            very high land. About noon this day it cleared up, and we had lat. 8° 34' N. In the
            evening we sent a canoe to search the island. In it they found good water, and even
            ground, but withal an open road. At night we stood off the first watch, and the last we
            had a land wind. The next day following at daylight we stood in, and about noon we came
            to an anchor at the East side of the island aforementioned, which is not in breadth
            above one league. In the afternoon we removed from our former anchoring place, and
            anchored again within shot of the N.E. point of the island. In this place grows great
            number of coco trees all over the greatest part of the isle. On the North side thereof
            are many rivulets of good water to be found in sandy bays. We saw moreover some good
            hogs on shore, whereof we killed one, and two pigs. Here are great numbers of turtle-
            doves, and huge store of fish, but withal, very shy to be caught. To Northward of the
            island it looks thus : — IsLA Del Cano LAT. 8* 45' N. April 27th we had some rain and
            wind the forepart of the day, but the afternoon was fair. The next day in hke manner we
            had great quantity of rain. On Saturday, the 30th, about seven o'clock in the morning we
            weighed anchor from the aforesaid island with little wind, and stood N.W. That day fell
            much rain, with great thunder and lightning. Monday, May 2nd. This day we observed and
            found lat. 9° N. The coast all along appeared to us very high and mountainous, and
            scarce six hours did pass but we had thunder, lightning, and rain ; the like continued
            for the two days following, wherein we had nothing but almost continual thunder and
            rain. On May 5th we had an indifferent fair day, and that evening we were right off of
            the Gulf of Nicoya. Friday, May 6th. This morning we saw the cape very CAPTURE OF TWO
            BARKS 419 plain before us. N. by E. from it, are certain quays at eight leagues distance
            close under the main. We steered N.N.W. towards the biggest of them, at whose E.S.E.
            side are two or three small rocks. The main eastward is fine savanna, or plain and even
            land, through which goes a very great road, which is to be seen from the sea. At noon
            the port of Caldero, commonly called Puerto Caldero, bore N. from us. At which time the
            ebb forced us to sound in the middle of the gulf, where we found fourteen fathom water.
            After this we anchored nearer to the eastern quays, in 19 fathom, where we had oozy
            ground. Saturday, May 7th. The night before this day was very fair all night long. In
            the morning we went in a canoe, being several in company, to seek for a place to lay our
            ship in. Amongst the islands along the shore we found many brave holes, but little or no
            water in them, which caused us to disHke what we had found. On one of the said islands
            we happened to find a hat, and many empty jars of water, which showed us that some
            people had been lately there. About eight in the evening our ship weighed anchor at
            young flood, and about three in the afternoon we anchored again in six-fathom water.
            Sunday, May 8th, 1681. The night before this day, we had much rain, with thunder and
            Ughtning. The morning being come, our Commander, Captain Sharp, departed from the ship
            in two canoes, with 22 men in his company, out of design to surprise any vessels or
            people they could meet hereabouts. In the meanwhile, in the evening, we drove up with
            the tide (there being no wind) in the ship, for the space of two or three leagues
            higher, till we found but three fathom at high water. Here we backed astern. At this
            time we saw one of our canoes coming off from the island that was ahead of us (which was
            named Chira), calling for more men and arms, and saying there were two ships to be seen
            higher up the gulf. Hereupon eight of us went away with them ashore, whereof two joined
            the party aforementioned, and the six remaining were appointed to guard the prisoners
            they had taken. To these we showed ourselves very kind, as finding that they were very
            sensible of the cruelties of the Spaniards towards them and their whole nation. Here we
            found eight or nine houses and a small chapel standing. These people have 420
            SHIP-REPAIRS been in former times a considerable and great nation, but are now almost
            destroyed and extinguished by the Spaniards. We ascended a creek of the sea for a
            league, or thereabouts, and took two barks by surprisal, which were the two sail they
            had told us of before. One of these barks was the same we had taken before at Panama, of
            which I made mention at the beginning of this history. On Monday following this day we
            weighed anchor with our barks, and drove down the creek, with the tide at ebb, towards
            our ship. The prisoners that we had taken here informed us that, when we were to
            westward in these seas before, there lay lOO men at the port of Santa Maria. That our
            men who left us at the island of Cayboa, as was mentioned above, met the other bark that
            we lost at sea, as we were sailing thither, and thus all went overland together. That in
            the North Seas, near Porto Bello, they had taken a good ship, and that for this cause,
            ever since, the Spaniards had kept at the mouth of the river of Santa Maria three
            Armadilla barks, to stop and hinder others from going that way. On Monday night our
            Captain, with 24 men, went from the ship into another creek, and there took several
            prisoners, among whom was a shipwright and his men, who were judged able to do us good
            service in the altering of our ship : these carpenters being there actually building two
            great ships for the Spaniards. Having taken these men, they made a float of timber to
            bring down the tools and instruments they were working withal. Here it happened that
            they put several tools and some quantity of iron-work into a dory, to be conveyed down
            the river with the float. But this dory sank by the way, being overladen with iron, and
            one of our company, by name John Alexander, a Scotchman, was unfortunately drowned by
            this means. On Thursday following, May 12th, we sent a canoe from the ship, and found
            the dory that had been sunk. That evening likewise drove down the body of our drowned
            man aforementioned. Hereupon we took him up, and on Friday morning following threw him
            overboard, giving him three French volleys for his customary ceremony. Both this day and
            the day before we fetched water from a point near the houses on the island of Chira
            aforementioned. From the ship also we sent away a Spanish merchant whom we had
            LIBERATION OF PRISONERS 421 taken among the prisoners, to fetch a certain number of
            beeves that might serve for a ransom of the new bark taken here. This day the weather
            was fair, but on Sunday following it rained from morning until night. On Monday, May
            i6th, we began to work all hands together on our ship. On Tuesday an Indian boy named
            Peter ran away from us. He belonged to Captain Sawkins, and waited on him as his
            servant. On Wednesday died an Indian slave, whose name was Salvador. On Thursday we
            heard thirty or forty guns fired on the main, which caused us to think that these would
            also turn to Hilo beeves. On Friday we caught cockles, which were as large as both our
            fists. At night there fell such dreadful rain, with thunder, lightning, and wind, that
            for the space of two hours the air was as light as day ; the thunder not ceasing all the
            while. On Sunday we con- tinued to work ; the night before which day we had more
            thunder, lightning, and rain. Wednesday, May 25th. This day we finished our great piece
            of work, viz. the taking down the deck of our ship. Besides which, the length of every
            mast was shortened ; and all was now served and rigged, insomuch that it would seem
            incredible to strangers, could they but see how much work we performed in the space of a
            fortnight or less. The same day likewise we set at liberty our Spanish carpenters, who
            had been very serviceable to us all this while, the old pilot, the old Spaniard taken at
            the isle of Iquique, and several others of our Spanish prisoners and slaves. To these
            people, but chiefly to the Spanish carpenters as a reward for their good service, we
            gave the new bark which we had taken at this place. But the old bark we thought fit to
            keep, and sail in our company, as we did, putting into her for this purpose six of our
            own men and two slaves. The next day we fell down as low as Vanero, a place so called
            hereabouts, and would have sailed away again that very evening but that our tackle gave
            way in hoisting our anchor, whereby we lay still. In the Gulf of Nicoya we experienced
            most commonly a fresh breeze, and at night a land wind. Friday, May 27th. This day
            likewise we drove down with the tide as low as Cavallo, another place so named in the
            gulf. Here we stayed and watered that day ; and here one Cannis Marcy, our interpreter,
            ran away from us. 422 THE GULF OF NICOYA On May 28th in the morning we sailed thence,
            and came within 29 leagues of that rich and rocky shore. Yet, notwithstanding, we had
            but seven fathom water. Here I saw this day a white porpoise. Behind this island is a
            town called New Cape Blanco. At Puerto Caldero, above-mentioned, is but one storehouse
            to be seen. We came to an anchor in the depth of seven-fathom water, at the distance of
            a league from shore, and caught five turtle. May 29th. This day we saw Cape Blanco. Both
            this day and the day following we continued tacking out of the gulf against a South
            wind. Here I took the ensuing demonstration of the Gulf of Nicoya, which, for the use of
            the reader, I have hereunto annexed. CHAPTER XIX They depart from the Gulf of Nicoya to
            Golfo Dulce, where they careen their vessel. An account of their sailings along the
            coast ; also a description of Golfo Dulce. The Spaniards force the Indians of Darien to
            a peace by a stratagem con- trived in the name of the English Wednesday, June ist, 1681.
            This day we had very fair weather, and yet but little wind. Hereupon the tide, or
            current, drove us to the Westward of Cape Blanco. Off this Cape, and at the distance of
            two miles within the sea, is situate a naked and nothing but barren quay. At E. by N.,
            and at 4 leagues distance, Cape Blanco gave us this appear- ance : — Cabo Blanco LAT. 9"
            30' N. The coast here along runs N.W. half W., and grows lower and lower towards Cape
            Guyones. This cape at 7 leagues distance, and at N.W. by N., appeared thus to us : —
            Cabo de Guyones LAT. 10" 00' N. At first sight the cape appeared very like two islands.
            The latter part of this day was cloudy, which hindered much our prospect. 423 424 PUERTO
            DE VELAS June 2nd. This morning we saw land, which appeared like several quays to us at
            N.W. by N., and at 7 leagues distance. It was the land of Puerto de Velas, and appeared
            thus : — Puerto de Velas This evening our Captain called us together and asked our
            opinions concerning the course we ought to steer. Having discussed the points by him
            proposed amongst us, we all resolved to bear up for Golfo Dulce, and there careen our
            vessels. This being done, we concluded to go thence to the cape, and cruise thereabouts
            under the equinoctial. We observed this day that our bark taken at the gulf of Nicoya
            sailed much better than our ship. Friday, June 3rd. The night before this day was very
            fair, and we had a fresh wind, our course being S.E. This morning we saw no land. In the
            evening the wind came about at S.S.W. and S.W. by S. June 4th. This day we stood E. and
            E. by N., the wind being W. and W. by N. In the evening we stood N.E., and descried land
            at the distance of 24 leagues, more or less, from Cape Blanco. Sunday, June 5th. Last
            night we lay by for all, or the greater part thereof. This morning we saw the island of
            Cano above described, which bore E.S.E. from us. We saw likewise multitudes of fish, but
            they would not bite. Also water-snakes of divers colours. June 6th. All last night we
            had rain, and with it but little wind— yea, scarce enough to carry us clear off from the
            island aforementioned. Towards morning we had a fresh wind at N.N.W. So then we stood
            out S. until morning, and, this being come, we stood N.E. by E. The land runs from Punta
            Mala to Gclfo Dulce and Punta Borrica, E.S.E. half S. At 9 leagues distance we laid the
            island of Cano. Punta Borrica at the same distance, or thereabouts, looks thus : — PUNTA
            BORRICA 425 PUNTA BORRICA LAT. 8** oo' N. The West end of Golfo Dulce is very high land,
            and a high rock Hes close off it. Besides which, two other rocks lie farther out ; the
            outermost of which is a mile distant from the shore. The East side is also high, but
            breaks into small points and bays, growing lower and lower to Punta Borrica. We came
            about a mile within the mouth of the gulf ; then anchored in eight-fathom-and-a-half
            water. The mouth of the gulf is almost 3 leagues over. The next day, being June 7th, we
            weighed anchor again at young flood, and got about 2 leagues higher. At evening we came
            again to anchor in seven-fathom-and-a-half water. It rained this day until eight
            o'clock, more like the pouring down of water from the clouds than the usual falling of
            drops. Wednesday, June 8th, at daybreak we weighed anchor again, with a fresh
            sea-breeze. The higher up we went, the deeper we found the gulf, and at last no ground
            even with thirty-fathom of line. This day we sent our canoe away to seek water and a
            good place to lay our ship in. Having landed, they found one Indian and two boys, which
            they made prisoners and brought aboard ; we used them very kindly, giving them victuals
            and clothes, for they had no other than the bark of a tree to cover their nakedness
            withal. Being examined, they informed us that a Spanish priest had been amongst them,
            and had made peace with their nation, ordering them strictly not to come near any ship
            nor vessel that had red colours, forasmuch as that they were Englishmen, and would
            certainly kill them. Being asked where now the priest was, they answered that he was
            gone to a great Spanish town, which was distant thence four sleeps up in the countiy.
            After this the Indian left the two boys, his children, with us, and went to fetch more
            Indians to us, from a plantain-walk, or grove, situated by a river a league off, or
            thereabouts. We came to an anchor in a bay close by one of the Indian quays, where two
            fresh rivers were within a stone' s-throw of each other, in
            twenty-s6ven-fathom-and-a-half water, and at a 42 6 INDIANS OF GOLFO DULCE cable's
            length from the mark of low water. The Indians whom our prisoner went to seek came to us
            several times, selling to us honey, plantains, and other necessaries that we usually
            bought of them or trucked for with other things. We also made use of their bark-logs in
            tallowing our ship, in which concern they did us good service. Their darts are headed
            with iron as sharp as any razor. Here one of the prisoners which we took at the Gulf of
            Nicoya informed us by what means, or rather stratagem of war, the Spaniards had forced a
            peace upon the Indians of the province of Darien since our departure thence. The manner
            was as follows : A certain Frenchman who ran from us at the island of Tavoga to the
            Spaniards was sent by them in a ship to the river's mouth, which disembogues from that
            province into the South Sea. Being arrived there, he went ashore by himself in a canoe,
            and told the Indians that the English who had passed that way were come back from their
            adventures in the South Sea. Withal he asked them if they would not be so kind and
            friendly to the Englishmen as to come aboard and conduct them on shore. The poor
            deceived Indians were very joyful to understand this good news, and thus 40 of the chief
            men among them went on board the Spanish vessel, and were immediately carried
            prisoners-of-war to Panama. Here they were forced to conclude a peace, though upon terms
            very disadvantageous to them, before they could obtain their liberty. These poor and
            miserable Indians of Golfo Dulce would come every day into our company, and eat and
            drink very famiharly with us all the time we were there. We laid our ship on ground, but
            the water did not ebb low enough to see her keel. Whilst we were careening our vessel,
            we built a house upon the shore, both to lodge and eat in, and every day we caught
            plenty of good fish. On Sunday, June 12th, the work of careening our ship going on in
            due order, we came to cleanse our hold, and here on a sudden both myself and several
            others were struck totally blind with the filth and nastiness of the said place. Yet
            soon after we recovered our sight again without any other help than the benefit of the
            fresh and open air, which dissipated those malignant vapours that had oppressed our
            eyes. On June 14th we had a great and fierce tornado, with which our cable broke, and,
            had it KING CHARLES' HARBOUR 427 not then happened to be high water at that instant, we
            had been lost inevitably. However, we had the good fortune to shore her up again, and by
            that means secure ourselves from farther danger. On June 21st we weighed anchor again,
            and went a league higher than the former place. Here we watered, and in the meanwhile
            left men below to cut wood. Thursday, June 23rd. This day ran away from us two negroes.
            The name of one of them was Hernando, who was taken with Don Thomas de Argandona on the
            coast of Guayaquil, as was mentioned above. The other was named Silvestre, having been
            taken at the town of Hilo. Following the example of these aforementioned, on Monday,
            June 27th, that is, four days after, two more of our prisoners endeavoured to make their
            escape, both of them slaves. One of these was named Francisco, who was a negro, and had
            been taken in the coco-ship mentioned before. The name of the other was also Francisco,
            and he was an Indian born, who was taken before Panama. Their attempts to escape
            succeeded not, for we caught them both again before they got on shore. On Tuesday
            following I went to sail up and down the gulf in the little bark belonging to our ship ;
            and, having viewed all places, took this description of Golfo Dulce here inserted. Our
            captain gave this gulf the name of King Charles, his Harbour, CHAPTER XX They depart
            from Golfo Dulce, to go and cruize under the equinoctial. Here they take a rich Spanish
            vessel with 37,000 pieces-of -eight, besides plate and other goods. They take also a
            packet-hoat hound from Panama to Lima. An account of their sailings and the coast alo7tg
            Our vessel being now careened and all things in a readiness for our departure, on
            Tuesday, June 28th, in the afternoon, we weighed anchor to go to sea again, turning out
            towards the mouth of Golfo Dulce. Our design was to cruize under the equinoctial, as had
            been concluded upon before, thereby to get what purchase we could by sea, seeing the
            greatest part of our attempts on land had proved hitherto very unsuccessful to us.
            Wednesday, June 29th. Both the night last past and this day we had rainy weather. About
            three in the afternoon a fresh gale sprang up at S.W. and S.S.W., our course being S.E.
            and S.E. by S. At five this evening the gulf bore N.W. by W., 7 leagues distant, and
            Punta Borrica 3 leagues and a-half distant. Thursday, June 30th. All night past we
            enjoyed a fresh gale at S.S.W. We sailed in the bark (where I was) better than the
            man-of-war, for so we called the Trinity vessel, notwithstanding that she was newly
            cleansed and tallowed. This day we had hazy weather, and I reckoned myself from Punta
            Borrica S.S.E. 18 leagues and a-half. July 1st, 1681. Last night we had two or three
            tornados. I reckoned this day a S.S.E. way, and by a clear observation found lat. 6° 10'
            N. We saw great quantities of fish as we sailed this day. July 2nd, We made a S.E. way,
            and our reckoning was 64 by it. By observation I found lat. 5° 20' N. At noon the same

            just past was windy, with rain, which forced us to hand our top-sails. Our reckoning
            this day was a S.E. way, and 100 miles. July 5th. We had a clear night, and withal a
            fresh gale. By this we made a S.E. way. Our latitude this day gave us 2° 20' N. This
            morning we saw land Southward of us, lying in low hummocks. It was the point, so called,
            of Manglares. Wednesday, July 6th. We turned up along shore, and by observation took
            this day lat. 2° 02' N. Hereabouts with every new moon is experienced a windward
            current. In the evening of this day we were close in with low land. We had windy weather
            and a great sea. Thursday, July 7th. This day by observation we found lat. 01° 48' N. In
            the evening of the said day we lost sight of the said ship. The next day, being July
            8th, we saw the ship again, whose loss began to create some concern in our minds. This
            day we made very high land all along as we went. And the port, or rather bay, of San
            Matteo, or St Matthew, appeared to us like several islands. Saturday, July 9th. This
            morning we stood fair in with the port of Tucames. Off the highest part of the land
            there seems to lie a quay. At the North-east point of the port it appears exactly thus :
            — Puerto de Tucames This day at noon we had a clear observation, which gave us lat. 01°
            22' N. Sunday, July 10 th. Last night we stood off to sea, thereby to keep clear of the
            shore. This day observation showed us lat. 01° 31' N. About noon the same day we
            happened to spy a sail, to which immediately we gave chase. We bore up one point of the
            compass, thereby to hinder her laskmg away ; 430 CAPTURE OF A RICH PRIZE but
            notwithstanding in the evening lost sight of her again. However, our great ship got up
            with her, and at about eight o'clock at night made her a prize. She proved to be the
            same" ship, named San Pedro, which we had taken the last year, being then bound from
            Truxillo to Panama, and laden with wine, gunpowder, and pieces-of-eight, whereof mention
            was made in its due place. Thus this same bottom became doubly fortunate to us, being
            twice taken by us in the space of fourteen months. For she had on board her now 21,000
            pieces of eight, in eight chests, and in bags 16,000 more, besides plate. Monday and
            Tuesday, the nth and 12th of the said month, we made in for the shore. Our prize was so
            deeply laden that she seemed to be buried in the water. She had 40 men on board her,
            besides some merchants and friars. On Tuesday an observation gave us lat. 1° 20' N.
            Wednesday, July 13th. This day we dared not adventure into the bay of San Matteo,
            because we saw some Indians, who had made a great fire on shore, which, as we judged,
            was designedly done to give intelHgence of our arrival. Hereupon we bore away for the
            river of Santiago, six leagues distant, more or less, from the bay aforementioned, to
            the North-east. Thursday, Friday, and Saturday of the said week we spent in taking out
            what parcels of coco-nut we thought fit from on board the prize, which was chiefly laden
            with the said com- modity. This being done, we cut down the main-mast by the board, and
            gave them only their main-sail, and thus turning the ship loose sent away in her all our
            old slaves, for the good service they had done us, taking new ones from the prize in
            their room. One only we still detained, who was Francisco, the negro that attempted to
            run away by swimming ashore, as was mentioned above. Sunday, July 17th. This day we went
            from the ship, and found the river of Santiago above-mentioned. At the mouth of this
            river we stayed Monday and Tuesday following to take in water, which we now much wanted.
            On the sides of the river we found good store of plantains. Our fresh water we fetched
            the distance of four miles up the river. We saw several Indians, but could not speak
            with them they were so shy of us, being forewarned by the Spaniards not to come near us.
            On Wednesday, July 20 th, we shared our plunder among CABO PASSAO 431 ourselves, or
            rather this day made part of the dividend of what we had taken, the rest being reserved
            to another day. Our prisoners being examined, informed us that the Spaniards had taken
            up our anchors and cables which we left behind us at the isle of Juan Fernandez. Also
            that they had surprised the Mosquito Indian that we left behind us there on shore, by
            the hght of a fire which he made in the night upon the isle. Tuesday, July 21st. All the
            last four-and-twenty hours we stood off and on. The next day we shared the rest of our
            things taken in the prize, as also the money that was in the bags ; the rest we laid up
            to divide upon another occasion, especially after such time as we were got through the
            Strait of Magellan. Our dividend amounted to the sum of 234 pieces-of-eight to each man.
            Our prisoners informed us this day that a new Viceroy of Peru was arrived at Panama, and
            that he dared not adventure up to Lima in a ship of 25 guns that was at Panama for fear
            of meeting with us at sea, but had chosen rather to wait until the Armada came down from
            Lima to safeguard and conduct him thither. July 23rd we had a fresh breeze at S.W., and
            the next day a clear observation, which gave us only latitude 14' N. This day Cape San
            Francisco at N.E. appeared thus to us : — Cabo de San Francisco Monday, July 25th. This
            day we observed latitude 01° 20' S., and we had a south-west wind. July 26th. This
            morning we had a very great dew fallen in the night last past. The weather in like
            manner was very close. On Wednesday, July 27th, Cape Passao, at S.S.W. and at 6 leagues
            distance appeared thus : — Cabo Passao 432 CAPTURE OF A PACKET-BOAT The same morning
            about seven o'clock we spied a sail E.S.E. from us, under the shore. We presently gave
            her close chase, as eagerly as we could, and about noon came up with her. But several of
            the people belonging to her were already got on shore, whereby they made their escape
            from being taken our prisoners. These were chiefly a friar, who was either a passenger
            or chaplain to the vessel, and five negroes. She proved to be a harco d'adviso, or
            packet-boat, that was going with letters from Panama to Lima. In this bark we took among
            other prisoners two white women who were passengers to the same place. Both these and
            the rest of the prisoners told us they had heard at Panama that we were all gone out of
            these seas homewards overland, and that made them adventure now up towards Lima —
            otherwise they had not come. This day and the Thursday following we spent in taking out
            of the packet-boat what we could find in her, which all were things of no considerable
            value, they having scarce brought any thing with them but the packet. They told us,
            moreover, that the new Viceroy of Peru, of whom we made mention above, was setting forth
            from Panama under the conduct of three sail of ships, the one of i6, the other of 8, and
            the third of 6 guns. That a general peace was all over Europe, excepting only that the
            EngHsh had wars with the Algerines by sea and the Spaniards by land. Having got what we
            could out of the prisoners and the vessel, we gave them their hberty, and sent them away
            in the same bark, being desirous not to encumber ourselves with more than we could well
            manage. That night we stood out to sea all night long, most of our men being fuddled.
            CHAPTER XXI . They take another Spanish ship richly laden under the equinoctial. They
            make several dividends of their booty among themselves. They arrive at the isle of
            Plate, where they are in danger of being all massacred by their slaves and prisoners.
            Their departure thence for the port and bay of Paita, with design to plunder the said
            place The next morning after we had turned away the packet-boat aforementioned, the
            weather being very close, we spied another sail creeping close under our lee. This
            vessel looked mighty big, so that we thought she had been one of their chief men-of-war
            who was sent to surprise or destroy us. Notwith- standing, our brave Commander, Captain
            Sharp, resolved to fight her, and either to take the said vessel, though never so big,
            or that she should take us. To this effect, coming nearer to her, we easily perceived
            she was a merchant-ship of great bulk, as most of your Spanish vessels are, and very
            deeply laden. Being up with them, those within her fired three or four guns at us first,
            thinking to make their party good against us. But we answered them briskly with a
            continual volley of small arms, so that they soon ran down into the hold, and
            surrendered, crying aloud for quarter. As it should seem, we had killed in that volley
            their Captain and one seaman, and also wounded their boatswain : which loss of their
            commander daunted them so suddenly, he being a man of good repute in those seas. Captain
            Sharp, with twelve more of our company, entered her the first. In this vessel I saw the
            most beautiful woman that I ever saw in all the South Sea. The name of the captain of
            this vessel was Don Diego Lopez, and the ship was called El Santo Rosario, or The Holy
            Rosary. The men we found on board her were about the number of 40, more or less. 2 F .
            433 434 CAPTURE OF EL SANTO ROSARIO Having examined our prisoners, they informed us that
            the day before they set sail from El Callao, from which port they were going towards
            Panama, our men whom they had taken prisoners at Arica were brought into that place and
            very civilly entertained there by all sorts of people, but more especially by the women.
            That one of our surgeons, whom we suspected to be Mr Bullock, was left behind, and
            remained still at Arica. We lay at anchor from Friday, July 29th, which was the day we
            took this prize, until Wednesday following, at the same place under Cape Passao as we
            anchored before. Here we sank the bark that we had taken at the Gulf of Nicoya, being
            willing to make use of what rigging she had, and also to contract our number of men. In
            the meanwhile we took out of the prize much plate and some money ready coined, besides
            620 jars of wine and brandy, and other things. Thus, leaving only the fore-mast standing
            in the said vessel, we turned her away, as we had done the others before, together with
            all the prisoners in her, giving them their liberty not to be encumbered with them,
            being desirous to spare our provisions as much as we could. We detained only one man,
            named Francisco, who was a Biscayner, because he reported himself to be the best pilot
            of those seas. This being done, we shared all the plate and linen taken in our prize,
            and weighed thence, standing S.S.E. with a fresh wind that sprang up. Friday, August
            4th. This day we shared the ready money taken in The Rosario, our last prize. Our
            dividend came to 94 pieces-of-eight each man. Cape Passao, under which all these prizes
            were taken, at N.E. appears thus : — Cabo Passao The land runs S.E., and is for 5
            leagues together to windward of this cape, all mountainous and high land. The next day,
            being August 5th, we completed our dividends, sharing this day all our odd money,
            ready-coined, and plate, with some other things. MUTINY OF SLAVES AND PRISONERS 435
            Saturday, August 6th. This day perusing some letters taken in the last prize, I
            understood by them that the Spaniards had taken prisoner one of the last party of our
            men that left us. Also that they were forced to fight all their way overland as they
            went, both against the Spaniards and the Indians, these having made peace with the
            Spaniards since our departure, as was mentioned above. That our EngHshmen had killed,
            amongst other Spaniards, the brother of Captain Assientos and Captain Alonso, an officer
            so named. Moreover, that ten sail of privateers were coming out of the North Sea, with
            intent to march over-land into the South Sea, as we had done before, but that they were
            prevented, being forced back by the great rains that fell near the islands called
            Samballas. On August 7th we had very fair weather, notwithstanding some stiong winds
            from shore, and also a strong current to leeward. This ran so fierce against us the next
            day, August 8th, that in the space of the last four-and-twenty hours we lost three
            leagues. Tuesday, August 9th, we saw the port and town of Manta, this being nothing but
            sixteen or seventeen stragghng houses, with a large and high brick church belonging to
            it. What we got in the day by the help of the wind we lost in the night by the current.
            The same fortune we had the next day, for we still gained no way all this while.
            Thursday, August nth. All last night we had but little wind ; this day we had a violent
            current to windward, as before, with some gusts of wind. However, by the help of these
            we made shift to get to windward of the isle of Plate. August I2th, in the morning, we
            came to an anchor at the aforesaid isle. We sent our boat ashore with men, £is we had
            done formerly, to kill goats, but we found them to be extremely shy and fugitive
            compared with what they were the last year. Here it was that our quartermaster, James
            Chappel, and myself fought a duel together on shore. In the evening of this day our
            slaves agreed among themselves and plotted to cut us all in pieces, not giving quarter
            to any, when we should be buried in sleep. They conceived this night afforded them the
            fittest opportunity by reason that we were all in drink. But they were discovered to our
            Commander by one of their own companions, and one of them named Santiago, whom we
            brought from Iquique, leapt overboard ; 436 ISLE OF SOLANGO who, notwithstanding, was
            shot in the water by our Captain, and thus punished for his treason. The rest laid the
            fault on that slave, and so it passed, we being not wilHng to inquire any farther into
            the matter, having terrified them with the death of their companion. We lay at this isle
            until Tuesday following, and in the meanwhile gave our vessel a pair of boots and tops^,
            being very merry all the while with the wine and brandy we had taken in the prize. On
            Tuesday, August i6th, in the afternoon, we weighed thence with a S.W. wind. The island
            at N.W. from us gave us this following appearance : — Isle de la Plata Wednesday, August
            17th, the island at E., this morning and at 2 leagues and a-half distance appeared thus
            : — Island of Plate All the day long until the evening we had a leeward current, but
            then I could not perceive any. Thursday, August i8th. This morning we were to wind- ward
            of the island of Solango. In the night before we had continual misty rain. At noon the
            aforesaid island bore N. by E. of us, and at 3 leagues distance appeared thus : — Isle
            de Solango ^ Perhaps a play upon the phrase ' topsy-boosy ' = drunk. A person very drunk
            is said to be ' in his boots ', which Bishop Kennet {Glossary — DEPARTURE FOR PAITA 437
            About 3 leagues from Solango are two rocks, called Los Ahorcados. They appear both high
            and black to the view. Besides this N.N.E. from Point St Helena is a high rock, which to
            windward thereof runs shoaling for the space of half-a-mile under water. It is distant
            about eight leagues, more or less, from the said point, and is called Chanduy. At this
            place, and upon this rock, was lost the ship aforementioned that was ordered from these
            seas to the aid of our most gracious Sovereign, King Charles the First, late King of
            England. Said ship had on board, as the Spaniards relate, to the sum of many milUons of
            pieces-of-eight ; all which quantity of plate was sent as a present to our King, being
            then in his troubles, by the worthy merchants of Lima. The rock aforementioned lies
            about two leagues distant from the mainland. August 19th. This day our pilot told us
            that, since we were to windward, a certain ship that was coming from Lima bound for
            Guayaquil ran ashore on Santa Clara, losing there in money to the value of 100,000
            pieces-of-eight ; which otherwise, peradventure, we might very fortunately have met
            with. Moreover, that the Viceroy of Peru had beheaded their great Admiral Ponce, for not
            coming to fight and destroy us while we were at Gorgona. This evening we saw point St
            Helena at the distance of ten leagues to S.S.E. from us. August 20th. This day we had
            both misty and cold weather. In the afternoon we saw Point St Helena, at N.E. by N. and
            at 7 leagues distance, more or less. On Sunday, August 21st, we had a fair and clear
            day. I reckoned myself this day to be about 25 leagues to the Southward of St Helena.
            August 22nd. This morning about two o'clock we came close in with the shore. We found
            ourselves to leeward of a certain point called Punta de Mero, which is nothing else than
            a barren and rocky point. Here runs an eddy current under the shore. Tuesday, August
            23rd. This day in the morning we had but little wind. At noon it blew fresh again. We
            made all day but short trips, and reefed topsails. in his Parochial Antiquities. 1695)

            DEPARTURE FOR PAITA Wednesday, August 24th. This morning a great dew fell. At noon we
            were W. from Cape Blanco. We found by observation lat. 4° 13' S. We resolved now to bear
            up for Paita, and take it by surprise if possible, thereby to provide ourselves with
            many necessaries that we wanted. CHAPTER XXII They arrive at Paita, where they are
            disappointed of their expecta- tions, as not daring to land, seeing all the country
            alarmed before them. They hear away for the Strait of Magellan. Description of the hay
            and port of Paita, and Colan. An account of their sailings toivards the Strait
            aforementioned Thursday, August 25th. The night before this day we stood off to sea for
            fear of the shore and lest we should be descried from the coast of Paita, to which we
            were now pretty nigh. About noon this day we began to stand in again, and saw the homing
            of the land, though with hazy weather. The next day, being August 26th, we had cold
            winds, great dews, and dry weather. Saturday, August 27th. All this day, but more
            especially in the morning, we had many fogs. In the afternoon we saw la Silla de Paita
            at W.S.W., being about five leagues distant from it. Sunday, August 28th. Last night
            about ten o'clock we were close into land, at the distance of half-a-league, more or
            less, to leeward of the island of Lobos. We continued our course all that night, and
            about break of day found ourselves close under Pena Horadada, a high and steep rock so
            called. Hence we sailed with a land-wind, and sent away from the ship two canoes well
            manned and armed, with good hopes to have taken the town of Paita undescried. But, as it
            should seem, they had already received news of our coming or being upon that coast, and
            also had received supplies of forces that were sent them from the city of Piura, distant
            thence 12 leagues up-country. These supplies consisted chiefly of three companies of
            horse and foot, all of them being armed with firearms. Besides this, they had made a
            breastwork along the sea-side for the defence of the town and the great church, 439 440
            PAITA; COLAN which Hes at the outermost part of the town. From these places, as also
            from a hill that covers the town, they fired at our men, who were innocently rowing
            towards shore with their canoes. This preposterous firing was the preservation of our
            people, for, had the Spaniards permitted our men to come ashore, they had assuredly
            destroyed them every man. But fear always hinders that nation of victory, at least in
            most of our attempts. Our men, perceiving themselves to be discovered and the enemy
            prepared for their reception, hereupon retreated, and came on board the ship again
            without attempting to land or do anything else in relation to the taking of the place.
            We judged there could not be less than 150 fire-arms, and four times as many lances upon
            the shore, all in readiness to hinder our people from landing. Within the town our pilot
            told us there might be 150 families. Being disappointed of our expectations at Paita, we
            stood down the bay towards Colan. This is another town so called, and which exceeds
            Paita three times. It is chiefly inhabited by fishermen, and thence they send fish to
            most inland towns of Peru, and also serve Paita with water from the river Colan, not far
            distant from the town. It is two leagues, more or less, from the town of Paita
            aforementioned to Colan, and thence to the river one league, although the houses of
            Colan do reach almost to the river. The town of Colan itself is inhabited only by
            Indians, and these are all rich because they will be paid in ready money for everything
            they do for the Spaniards. But the town of Paita is chiefly inhabited by Spaniards,
            though there be also some Indians ; but the Spaniards do not suffer the Indians to be
            any great gainers or grow rich under them. About ten o'clock a young breeze sprang up,
            and with that we stood away W., and W. by S. Within a little while it blew so fresh that
            we were forced to reef our topsails, the weather being very dark and hazy. I took the
            port of Paita and bay of Colan, as they lay exactly situated (see map). Monday, August
            29th. All our hopes of doing any further good upon the coasts of the South Sea being now
            frustrated, seeing we were descried before our arrival wherever we came, we resolved
            unanimously to quit all other attempts and bear away for the Strait of Magellan, in
            order to return home- THEY SAIL FOR MAGELLAN 441 wards either for England or some of our
            plantations in the West Indies. This day we had a great dew, and I reckoned myself
            W.S.W. from Paita 13 leagues and a-half, with very little wind. So we stood E. The next
            day, August 30th, we had misty weather. We made a W.S.W, way, and by it 5 leagues and
            one-third. In the afternoon of this day the wind freshened again, having been but little
            before, and we stood E.S.E. The last day of August we had very fair weather. I believed
            now that the wind was settled at S.E. and S.S.E. We made a S.S.W. way, and 21 leagues
            and two-thirds. September ist. Last night was very cloudy, but withal we had a fresh
            gale. Our reckoning was a S.W. by S. way, and that we had made 16 leagues and
            two-thirds. September 2nd. We reckoned a S.W. way, and by it 26 leagues and two-thirds.
            This day we had an observation and found lat. 7° 40' S. September 3rd brought us both
            cloudy and misty weather. We made a W.S.W. way, and 14 leagues. September 4th. This day
            the wind was at E.S.E. and sometimes E., coming in many flaws. We had a S.W. by S. way,
            and reckoned 23 leagues and two-thirds. We had a great sea from S. Monday, September
            5th, we had great winds, and a high and short sea. Our way was S.S.W. and half-W. by
            which we reckoned 28 leagues and two-thirds of a league. 442 THEY SAIL FOR MAGELLAN
            September 6th we had a very fresh wind at S.E. by E. with an indifferent smooth sea. By
            observation we found this day latitude 12° 00' S. We made a S.W. by S. way, and 28
            leagues and one-third. Wednesday, September 7th, we had a very fresh wind. We reckoned a
            S.W. by S. way, and 36 leagues. We observed latitude 13° 24' S. We make now for each
            mess a plum- pudding of salt water and wine lees. On the 8th we enjoyed a fresh gale of
            wind, though with hazy weather. Our reckoning was a S.W. by S. way, and hereby 25
            leagues and one-third of a league. September 9th we made a S.W. by S. way, and 21
            leagues and a-third. In the afternoon the wind came about some- thing more S., allowing
            us a S.W. course. Saturday, September 10 th. All last night past and this morning the
            wind was very fresh at E. Our way was S.S.W. and by our reckoning 35 leagues and
            one-third. The weather now was warm. An observation this day gave us latitude i6°4o'S.
            September nth we had whiffling winds. A S.W. half S. way, and thereby 12 leagues and
            two-thirds. By an observa- tion we found 17° 10' S. Now we had a very great sea, so that
            we took in our sprit-sail. September 12th. All the night before this day we were under a
            pair of courses ; yet this morning we heaved out main-topsail. We made a W.S.W. way, and
            17 leagues and one-third. By observation we found lat. 17° 30' S. The 13th. During last
            night we had huge and great storms of wind. In the morning our goose-head gave way, so
            that at about noon we were forced to lie by till four in the afternoon to mend it. Our
            course was S.W. half W. and our reckoning 29 leagues and two-thirds of a league. Lat. by
            observation i8°i2'S. Wednesday, September 14th. This day we had very hazy weather. We
            made a S.S.W. way, and 20 leagues. September 15th. This day likewise we had a S.S.W.
            way, and reckoned 23 leagues and one-half. Our observation taken this day gave us 20°
            09' S. On September i6th we had a clear day, a S.W. half S. way, and made 16 leagues and
            two-thirds. We found by observa- tion lat. 20° 48' S. THEY SAIL FOR MAGELLAN 443 The
            17th. Last night was very calm. Also this day, it being a full moon. We reckoned a S.W.
            way, and only by reason of the calmness of the weather 9 leagues and one-third of a
            league. We had an observation which afforded us 2i°o8'S. lat. Sunday, September i8th.
            Last night a wind sprang up at S.S.E. which the morning of this day freshened at S.E. We
            made a W.S.W. way, and by it 18 leagues. Moreover, this day we had a clear observation
            that showed us lat. 2i°3o'S. September 19th. All last night we had a very fresh wind,
            but this morning it came about to E. by S. and E.S.E. with hazy weather. I reckoned a
            S.W. by S. way, and 22 leagues. September 20th. This day gave us a fresh wind, hazy
            weather, a S. by W. way, and hereupon 23 leagues and one-third. September 21st. This day
            also the fresh gale continued, with cloudy, and sometimes misty, weather. Our reckoning
            showed us a S. by W. way as the day before, and by it 28 leagues and one-third. By an
            observation made we found lat. 25° 15' S. Thursday, September 22nd. This day we had a
            very fresh wind. We reckoned a S. half W. way, and by that 29 leagues and two-thirds. An
            observation taken gave us lat. 26° 42' S. We observed this day a N.E. sea, which seemed
            very strange to us. The next day we had several showers of small rain. My reckoning was
            a S. by W. way, and thereupon 26 leagues. We found by observation lat. 27° 57' S.
            September 24th. We had hazy weather, and the wind not so fresh at E.S.E., with a smooth
            sea. We made a S.S.W. way half-westerly, and 23 leagues and two-thirds. This day also an
            observation gave us lat. 28° 57' S. I reckoned now that we were distant from Paita 302
            leagues and two-thirds. Sunday, September 25th. This day we had not much wind, and hazy

            sea, and then soon 444 THEY SAIL FOR MAGELLAN after a N.N.E. wind. After this a N. wind,
            and that but very Httle. September 27th. All the night before this day we had a fresh
            wind at N.N.E. About eight this morning it came about again to N.N.W. We made a S.E. by
            S. way, and 38 leagues. By observation I found lat. 32° 30' S. Now we enjoyed a very
            smooth sea and fair weather. Wednesday, September 28th. In the night past a very fresh
            wind at N.N.W. and N.W. At break of day we had a wind heaving us a-back at once. At noon
            again the wind was at S.W., our course being S.E. This morning we took down our
            top-gallant masts. We made a S.E. by E. way, and on this road 27 leagues and two-thirds.
            By observation lat. 33° 16' S., a S.W. sea. On the 29th we had very windy and hazy
            weather, with some rain now and then. All last night we handed our main-top-sail. We
            made a S.E. by E. way, and 32 leagues and two-thirds. We had a S.W. sea and wind.
            Friday, September 30th. This day we had fresh winds between S.W. and W. We reckoned a
            S.E. half-S. way, and thereupon 44 leagues. By observation we found lat. 35° 54' S.
            October ist. The wind this day was not very fresh, but varying. My reckoning was a S.E.
            half-S. way, and twenty- four leagues. An observation gave us 36° 50' S. This day I
            finished another quadrant, being the third I finished in this voyage. We had a S.W. sea,
            with showers of rain and gusts of wind. Sunday, October 2nd. The wind this day was
            hanging between W.N.W. and N.W. by N. We made a S.E. by S. way, and 33 leagues and
            two-thirds. By observation we found 38° 14' S. About noon we had a fresh wind at N.W.
            and S.W. October 3rd. Last night in the fore-part' thereof was clear, but the latter was
            rainy. The wind very fresh at N.W. by N., but this day we had Httle wind, and cloudy
            weather, a S.W. by W. wind, and a S.E. by S. way, by which we reckoned 33 leagues and
            one-third. October 4th. We had a clear night and very fresh wind. We reckoned a S.E. by
            S. way, and thereby 43 leagues. By observation, lat. 41° ^4' S. This day also fell
            several showers of rain. THEY SAIL FOR MAGELLAN 445 October 5th. We had a windy night,
            and a clear day. We reckoned a S.S.E. half E. way, and 44 leagues and two- thirds. By
            observation lat. 43° 26' S. The weather now was very windy, causing a huge tempestuous
            sea. The wind at N.W. and N.W. by N. blowing very high. October 6th. This day the wind
            was still at N.W., and yet not so fresh as it was yesterday ; the weather very foggy and
            misty. As for the wind, it came in gusts, so that we were forced to hand our top-sails,
            and sprit-sail. We reckoned a S.E. half S. way, and thereby 43 leagues and one-third.
            The seas now were not so high as for some days past. In the evening we scudded away
            under our fore-course. Friday, October 7th. Last night was very cloudy, and this day
            both dark and foggy weather with small rain. We made a S.E. way, and 30 leagues and
            two-thirds. A fresh wind at N.N.W. and N.W. We keep still under a fore-course, not so
            much for the freshness of the wind as the closeness of the weather. October 8th. We had
            a clear night the night before this day, and a strong gale, insomuch that this day we
            were forced to take in our fore-sail, and loosen our mizzen, which was soon blown to
            pieces. Our eldest seamen said that they were never in the like storm of wind before —
            the sea was all in a foam. In the evening it dulled a little. We made a S.E. half E.
            way, and 18 leagues, with very dark weather. Sunday, October 9th. All the past night we
            had a furious W.N.W. wind. We set our sail a-drough^, and so drove to the southward very
            much, and almost incredibly if an observation had not happened, which gave us lat. 48°
            15' S. We had a very stiff gale at W.N.W. with a great sea from W., which met with a
            S.S.W. sea as great as it. Now the weather was very cold, and we had one or two frosty
            mornings. Yesterday in the afternoon we had a very great storm of hail. At noon we bent
            another mizzen. Monday, October loth. This day brought us a fresh wind at N.W. and
            N.N.W. We made a S.E. half-E. way, and by it 44 leagues. By observation we found lat.
            49° 41' S. I reckoned myself now to be east from Paita 69 leagues and a-half. ^
            Southwards. This is the only example of the use of this adverb given in N.E.D. 446 THEY
            SAIL FOR MAGELLAN Tuesday, Oct. nth. Last night we had a small time calm. This day was
            both cloudy and rainy weather. The wind at S.W. and S.S.W. so furious that at ten
            o'clock this morning we scudded under a main-sail. At noon we lowered our fore- yard
            while we sailed. We made a S.E. by E. way, and 30 leagues. CHAPTER XXIII The Buccaneers
            arrive at a place incognito, to which they give the name of the Duke of York's Islands.
            A description of the said islands and of the gulf, or lagoon, wherein they lie, so far
            as it was searched. They remain there many days by stress of weather, not without great
            danger of being lost. An account of some other remarkable things that happened there
            Wednesday, October 12th. All the night before this day we had many high winds. I
            reckoned an E.S.E. way, and twenty leagues, for our vessel drove at a great rate.
            Moreover, we were in lat-. 50° 50' S., so that our easting from Paita by my account
            ought to be 10 1 leagues, or thereabouts. This morning, about two hours before day, we
            happened by great accident to spy land. It was the great mercy of God, which had always
            attended us in this voyage, that saved us from perishing at this time, for we were close
            ashore before we saw it ; and our foreyard, which we most needed on this occasion, was
            taken down. The land we had seen was very high and towering ; and here appeared to be
            many islands scattered up and down. We steeied in with what caution we could, between
            them and the main, and at last, God be praised, arrived at a place^ or rather bay, where
            we perceived ourselves to be land-locked, and, as we thought, pretty safe from the
            danger of those tempestuous seas. From here we sent away our canoe to sound and search
            the fittest place for anchoring. At this time one of our men, named Henry Shergall, as
            he was going into our sprit-sail-top, happened to fall into the water, and was diowned
            before any help could be had, though we endeavoured it as much as we possibly could.
            This, incident several of our company interpreted as a bad omen of the place, which
            proved not so, 447 448 THE DUKE OF YORK'S ISLANDS through the providence of the
            Almighty, though many dangers were not wanting here to us, as I shall relate. We came to
            an anchor in the depth of 40 fathom, more or less, and yet at no greater distance than a
            stone' s-cast from shore. The water where we anchored was very smooth, and the high
            lands round about all covered with snow. Having considered the time of the year and all
            other circumstances, we resolved that, in case we could find a sufficient stock of
            provisions here, we would stay longer, that is until summer came or something more,
            before we prosecuted our intended voyage homewards through the Strait of Magellan ;
            which now we began to be careful how to find. That day of our anchoring in this bay we
            shot six or eight brave geese and some smaller fowl besides. Here we found also many
            hundreds of mussel-banks, all which were very plentifully rstocked with that kind of
            fish. We buried our dead man on the shore, giving him several volleys for his funeral
            rites, according to the custom. In the night of this day our anchor came home, so that
            we were forced to let go a-grappling to secure our- selves. But still every flaw of wind
            drove us. Hereupon we set our sprit-sail, and ran about a mile into another bay, where
            we let go another anchor, and thus anchored again. The first anchor, which was also the
            biggest in our ship, we lost by this accident, the cable being cut by the rocks. To
            these islands aforementioned our captain gave the name of His Royal Highness the Duke of
            York's Islands. Thursday, October 13th. This day we began to moor our ship, she driving
            as we easily could perceive with every flaw of wind that blew. The tide flows here full
            seven-feet up and down. We moored our vessel into a rocky point, being a quay, whereof
            there are many in the circumference of this bay. The ground of the bottom of the said
            bay we found was hard and sandy, being here and there rocky. This evening we brought on
            board great store of limpets, of which we made a kettle of broth, that contained more
            than all our company could eat. On Friday, October 14th we killed several geese, as also
            many of another sort of fowl like an eagle but having a bigger beak, with their nostrils
            rising from the top of the middle of their beak by a hand-trunk. This fowl lives on fish
            ; but we saw none. Yesterday in the evening there fell a great TEMPESTUOUS WEATHER 449
            sleet of snow on the hills round about the bay, but none where we were at anchor.
            Moreover, this day in the evening we caught hmpets in great quantity, being three times
            as nxany as we could eat. Our men, in ranging the quays for game, found grass plaited
            above a fathom long, and a knot tied at the end thereof. In like manner on other quays
            they found mussels and Umpet-shells. From these things we presently concluded that these
            countries were inhabited, and that some Indians or others were to be found hereabouts.
            Saturday, October 15th. Last night we had much rain, with large hailstones. About
            midnight the wind came to north with such great fury that the tree to which our cable
            was fastened on shore gave way and came up by the roots. All those gusts of wind were
            mixed with violent storms of rain and hail. Thus we fastened again to other trees. But
            here it happened that, our ship coming up to the shore, our rudder touched, and
            thereupon broke our goose-neck. Great was now our extremity, and greater it will be, if
            God send not better weather. Scarce a minute now passed without flaws of wind and rain.
            Sunday, October i6th. Last night was rainy, as before. About nine o'clock our biggest
            hawser gave way and broke. All this day likewise we had rain, with several showers of
            hail, and but Uttle wind to W. of N. Monday, October 17th. All last night, until five
            this morning, it ceased not to rain. Then until ten it snowed. On the hills it snowed
            all the night long. This day we hunted on the shore many tracks of people hereabouts,
            but could find none hitherto, they having fled and concealed themselves for fear of us,
            as we supposed. October i8th. In the past night we had much rain and hail. But the day
            was veiy clear. Hereupon we made an observation, which gave us lat. 50° 40' S. Moreover,
            this day we had pretty warm weather. October 19th. Both clear and frosty last night.
            This day was hazy, and somewhat windy from the north quarter. Every day we had plenty of
            limpets and mussels of a very large size. October 20 th. Last night was rainy, and this
            day windy, with very great gusts of wind at N.N.W. until the afternoon. Then we had wind
            at K.W., being very fresh and in gusts. 450 THEY CAPTURE TWO INDIANS October 21st. All
            the past night was tempestuous, with huge gusts of wind and showers of hail. Yesterday
            in the evening we carried a cable ashore, and fastened it to a tree. This being done, at
            midnight our biggest cable broke in the middle. Towards morning we had much snow. In the
            day, great gusts of wind with large hailstones ; and also great plenty of limpets.
            October 22nd. Last night we had strange gusts of wind from N.W., together with much hail
            and rain. This day we killed a penguin ; and also began to carry water on board. October
            23rd. All the last twenty-four hours we had much rain. The wind was but little at W. and
            W.S.W. October 24th. All this time until noon nothing but rain. At that time it held up
            fair for the space of half-an-hour, or thereabouts, and then it raintd again all the
            rest of the day. October 25th. All this while we had not one minute fair. Towards
            evening it held up from raining, but the weather was cloudy, and withal much warmer than
            when we came hither at first. Wednesday, October 26th. All the past night and this
            forenoon we had fair weather. But afternoon it rained again. We found cockles like those
            we have in England. Thursday, October 27th. Last night we had much rain, with very great
            gusts of wind, lasting for the whole space thereof. Yet, notwithstanding, this day
            proved to be the fairest that we ever had since we came into this place. In the evening
            of this day our canoe, which was gone to search the adjacent places for Indians or what
            else they could find, returned to the ship with a dory at her stern. They had gone, as
            it should seem, beyond the old bay where we first anchored, and thereabouts happened to
            meet with this dory. In it were three Indians, who, perceiving themselves near being
            taken, leaped overboard to make their escape. Our men in pursuing them unadvisedly shot
            one of them dead. A second, being a woman, escaped their hands. But the third, who was a
            lusty boy about eighteen years of age, was taken, and him they brought on board the
            ship. He was covered only with a seal's skin, having no other clothing about him. His
            eyes squinted, and his hair was cut pretty short. In the middle of the dory they had a
            file burning, THE INDIAN BOY 451 either for dressing victuals or some other use. The
            dory itself was built sharp at both ends, and flat-bottomed. They had a net to catch
            penguins, and a club like our bandies, called by them a tomahawk. His language we could
            not understand, but he pointed up the lagoon, giving us to under- stand that there were
            more people thereabouts. This was confirmed by our men, who also said they had seen
            more. They had darts to throw against an enemy, pointed with wood. On the next day,
            being October 28th, in the evening our canoe went from the ship again to seek for more
            Indians. They went into several lagoons, and searched them narrowly. But they could find
            nothing but two or three huts, all the natives being fled before our arrival. In the
            evening they returned to the ship, bringing with them very large limpets, and also
            mussels which were six-inches-and-a-half long. Our Indian prisoner could open these
            mussels with his fingers, which our men could not so readily do with their knives. Both
            the night past and this day we had very fair weather. On the 29th we had in hke manner a
            very fair day, and also a smooth wind at S.S.E. Our Indian this day pointed to us that
            there were men in this country, or not far off from here, with great beards. He appeared
            to us by his actions to be very innocent and foolish. But by his carriage I was also
            persuaded that he was a man-eater. This day Ukewise we caught limpets enough to suffice
            us for the morrow. Sunday, October 30th. This day was fair, and there blew a small
            vS.S.E. wind. In the morning we sent a canoe over to the eastward shore, to seek either
            for provisions or Indians. I myself could not go as I desired, being, with two or three
            more, at that time very much tormented with the gripes. I am persuaded that this place
            where we now were is not so great an island as some hydrographers lay it down, but
            rather an archipelago of smaller islands. We saw this day many penguins, but they were
            so shy that we could not come near them. They paddle on the water with their wings very
            fast, but their bodies are too heavy to be carried by the said wings. The sun now made
            the weather very warm, insomuch that the snow melted apace. October 31st. Both last
            night and this day were very fair. At noon our canoe letumed from tlie Eastern shore,
            452 THE DUKE OF YORK^S ISLANDS bringing word that they had found several good bays and
            harbours, that were deep even close to the shore, only that there lay in them several
            sunken rocks, which we had also where we were. But these rocks are not dangerous to
            shipping, by reason that they have weeds which lie two fathoms in circumference about
            them. This morning blew a small wind at N.N.E. November ist. This day was also fair, and
            we had a small wind as before, at N.N.E. November 2nd. Last night I took the polar
            distance of the South star of the cock's foot, and found it to be 28° 25'. I observed
            also the two Magellan clouds, of which I made mention in this Journal before, and found
            them to be as follows, viz. the lesser 14° 05', and the greater 14° 25'. The morning of
            this day we hoisted on end our top-masts, and also brought too a main-top-sail and
            fore-sail, and finished our filling all the water we needed. At the same time the wind
            hung easterly : and I was still much tormented with the gripes ao before. November 3rd.
            This morning we hung our rudder, the greatest piece of work we had to do, after those
            violent storms above-mentioned. In the afternoon we hauled in our two biggest hawsers,
            and also our biggest cable from the shore. For the last three days we had a very great
            and dark fog between us and the Eastward shore. We had now very little wind in the cove
            where we were, but abroad at sea there blew at the same time a stiff gale at S.S.E.
            More- over, we could perceive now, the stormy weather being blown over, much small fry
            of fish about the ship, whereof we could see none, as was mentioned before. This day we
            had a very clear and calm evening. November 4th. Both all last night and this day we had
            very calm weather. And this morning a small breeze sprang up at N. and N.N.E., which
            afterwards wheeled about to S. and S.S.E. This morning we hoisted our main and fore-
            yards, and likewise fetched off from the shore our other hawser and cable, into
            eleven-fathom water. Our resolutions were now changed for a departure, in order to seek
            the mouth of the Strait of Magellan, seeing that we could not winter here for want of
            provisions, which we could not find either on the continent or about these islands
            aforementioned. THE DUKE OF YORK'S ISLANDS 453 The weather now was very warm, or rather
            hot, and the bhds sung as sweetly as those in England. We saw here both thrushes and
            blackbirds, and many other sorts of those that are usually seen in our own country.
            Saturday, November 5th. This morning brought us a wind at N.N.E. hereupon : we warped to
            a rocky point, thereby to get out of the cove where we lay. For our anchor came home to
            us as we were carrying our warp out. At this time a second breeze came up very fresh in
            our stern, so that we took the opportunity thereof, and went away before it. By noon
            this day we hoisted in our canoes, and also turned away loose to the sea our Indian
            dory. As for the Indian .^^n^alfaf jsle/ boy whom we had taken in said dory we kept him
            still prisoner, and called him Orson. Our cove at our departure from this place looked
            thus, as I took then the description thereof. When we were come out into the channel,
            the weather grew dead calm — only now and then we had a small breeze, some- times from
            one quarter and then from another. By this slackness of wind we observed that the
            current hoisted us to the Southward. On the East side of this lagoon we per- ceived the
            Indians make a great smoke at our departure. We had a very fair day till six in the
            evening : when we got without the mouth of the gulf, it blew so hard that in an hour it
            forced us to hand our top-sails. Having now a fit gale at N.W. and N.N.W., we stood S.W.
            by W. to clear ourselves cf some breaks which lie four leagues from the 454 THE DUKE OF
            YORK'S ISLANDS gulf's mouth at S. and S.S.E. Hereabouts we saw many reefs and rocks,
            which occasioned us to stand close-hauled. I have drawn here and given to my reader so
            much as I have seen of the gulf itself ; the rest must be completed in due time by them
            that have greater opportunities of making a farther search into it than I had at the
            time of our stay here under such tempestuous weather as I have described, and the
            distemper which hung upon me at the same time. Snow kilLs ^ ^ icmafyBnjIifgulfe

            in quest of the Strait of Magellan, which they cannot find. They return home by an
            unknown way, never navigated before Sunday, November 6th. This morning we had lost the
            sight of land, so that we could see it no more. All the last night, and this day, we
            were under our two courses and sprit-sail. The weather this day was hazy. My reckoning
            was a S.W. half S. way, and by it 21 leagues. We had now an indifferently high sea, and
            a fresh wind at N.N.W. November 7th. Last night was both rainy and foggy ; but in the
            morning it cleared up. The wind for the most part was at W. and W.N.W. But at noon it
            came about at W.S.W. Our reckoning was a S.W. by S. way, and by it 20 leagues. We found
            by observation lat. 52° 03'. We now steered away S.S.E., the wind being at that time at
            W.S.W. In the evening of this day I found a variation of the needle to N.E. to the
            number of 15° or better. I was still troubled with the gripes as I had been before.
            November 8th. Last night was fair. About midnight the wind came to N.N.W. At the break
            of day we all were persuaded that we had seen land, but at noon we saw that it was none,
            but only a cloud. The wind was now at N. My reckoning was a S.E. half-E. way, and 32
            leagues and one-third. We had an observation that gave us 53° 27' S. The whole day was
            very fine and warm, and we saw great numbers of fowls and seals. November 9th. Yesterday
            in the evening the weather was cloudy. Hereupon we lay by under a main course. After
            midnight we sailed East, and E. by N., with a fresh wind at W.N.W. and not any great
            sea. The day itself was cloudy, and toward noon we had some rain. So at two in the
            after- 455 456 THEY SAIL FOR MAGELLAN STRAIT noon we lay by under a main course, the
            wind being fresh at N.W. I reckoned an E.N.E. way, and thereby 28 leagues. Thursday,
            November 10 th. All last night we lay under a main course, with a mere fret of wind at
            N.W. and N.N.W. Day being come, the wind rather increased, insomuch that about noon our
            sail blew to pieces. Hereupon we were forced to lower the yard and unbend the sail,
            lying for a little while under a mizzen. But that also soon gave way ; so that all the
            rest of this day we lay a hull in very dark weather, foggy and windy, with a huge sea,
            which oftentimes rolled over us. In the afternoon it seemed to abate for some space of
            time ; but soon after it blew worse than before, which compelled us to lower our
            fore-yard. November loth. All last night we had furious windy and tempestuous weather,
            from the points of N.W. and N.N.W., together with seas higher and higher. In the evening
            we set our mizzen : at which time the sun appeared very watery ; but the wind now abated
            by degrees, and the seas also. November 12th. This morning little wind was stirring, but
            only some rain fell. About ten it cleared up, by observa- tion lat. 55° 25'. The sea was
            now much fallen, and a fresh wind sprang up at W. and W.S.W. We experienced also a very
            great current to the S.W. In the afternoon of this day we set our sails again, resolving
            now unanimously to make for the Straits of St Vincent, otherwise called the Strait of
            Fernando de Magellan. We had a fresh wind at W.N.W., our course being S.S.E., under our
            sprit-sail, fore-sail, and fore- top-sail. This day we saw many fishes, or rather fowls,
            who had heads like Muscovy ducks, as also two feet like them. They had two fins like the
            foretins of turtles ; white breasts and bellies ; their beak and eyes being red. They
            are full of feathers on their bodies, and their hinder parts are like those of a seal ;
            wherewith they cut the water. The Spaniard calls these fowls paxaros ninos. They weigh
            most commonly about six or seven pounds, being about one-foot, a little more or less, in
            length. Our Commander, Captain Sharp, had so much dexterity as to strike two of them. In
            the evening we set also our mainsail, the wind now coming to S. of W. Sunday, November
            13th. All last night we had a fresh wind between S.W. and W.N.W., with sometimes mists
            of small rain. In the evening we enjoyed a fine leading gale at THEY SAIL FOR MAGELLAN
            STRAIT 457 W.N.W. together with both clear and wholesome weather. We made a S.E. way,
            and by' it 42 leagues and two-thirds. This day an observation gave us lat. 56° 55' S. We
            still experienced a great S.W. current. In the afternoon of this day we steered E.S.E.,
            and in the evening had whiffling- winds. November 14th. Both last night and this morning
            we had cloudy weather. About eight it cleared up. My reckon- ing was a S.E. by E. way,
            and by it 32 leagues. Our observa- tion gave us lat. 57'' 50' S. This day we could
            perceive land, and at noon were due W. from it. In the evening we stood E. by S.
            November 15th. All the past night was very cloudy. We judged now that we should be close
            in with the land we had seen the day before, but the morning being come we could see
            none. In the night much snow fell, and in the day we had great sleets thereof, the
            weather being very cold and cloudy. I reckoned an E.S.E. way, and hereby 29 leagues and
            two-thirds ; moreover, that our lat. was 58° 25' S. The wind was now so fresh at N. that
            we were forced to lie under our two courses and sprit-sail. November i6th. Most of this
            time we had still rain and snow, but now no night at all, though the weather was dark.
            The wind was various, but from midnight before this day the wind was at S.E. and S.S.E.
            We now lay E.N.E. I reckoned a N.E. by E. way, and 23 leagues. About four in the
            afternoon two of our fore-shrouds' bolts broke, but were presently mended. This
            afternoon also we saw a very large whale. In the evening we handed in our fore-top-sail,
            and lay under our pair of courses and sprit-sail, the evening being very clear. November
            17th. In the past night there was a very hard frost. At four this morning we saw two or
            three islands of ice at the distance of two or three leagues to the S. of us. Soon after
            this we saw several others, the biggest of them being at least 2 leagues round. By
            observation lat. 58° 23' S. We had now a vehement current to the S. At noon I saw many
            others of these islands of ice aforementioned, of which some were so long that we could
            scarce see the end of them, and extended about 10 or 12 fathom above-water. The weather
            in the meanwhile was very clear, and the 458 QUEST FOR MAGELLAN STRAIT wind cold. I
            found variation of the needle i8 degrees to the N.E. November i8th. All last night was
            very fair. I must call it night, for otherwise it was not daik at all. The sea was very
            smooth, and the wind at N. and N.N.W. I reckoned a N.E. by N. way, and by the same 22
            leagues. At ten it grew dead calm, which held all the afternoon of this day. But at
            night we had a wind again at N. and N. by E. November 19th. This day was cloudy with
            snow, and a frosty night preceding it. The wind now was so fresh at N. that we were
            forced to take in our topsails, and lie all day under our courses and sprit-sail. We
            made by an E.S.E. way 18 leagues and two-thirds. November 20th. We had a cloudy night,
            together with mizzling rain and snow. This morning fell so great a fog that we could not
            see from stem to stern of our ship. From ten o'clock last night we had also calm and
            very cold weather. But, what was worse than all this, we were now kept to a very short
            allowance of our sorry victuals, our provisions growing very scanty with us. About ten
            this morning we had a very small breeze at N. Several of our men were not able to endure
            the cold, so fierce it was ; whereby they were forced to lie and keep themselves as
            close as they could. We made an E. way, and by the same 16 leagues. This day at noon I
            reckoned myself to be E. from the gulf, whence we last departed, 205 leagues and
            two-thirds. Monday, November 21st. Last evening we caught a small and white land-fowl,
            and saw two or three more ; and also this morning. This sight afforded us good hopes we
            were not far distant from some coast or other, yet none could we see in all this long
            and tedious voyage. In the night past we had a calm ; and all this morning a great fog
            with much snow and rain. We reckoned an E. by N. way, and 10 leagues. At one in the
            afternoon we had a fresh gale that sprang up at E., and at E. by N. November 22nd, Most
            part of this day was calm. In the meanwhile we could observe our ship to drive E. My
            reckon- ing was an E.N.E. way, and thereby 13 leagues and one-third. At one in the
            afternoon we had a small gale at W.S.W., our course being N.N.E. and N.E. by N. November
            23rd. This day we had a gale at N.W. and QUEST FOR MAGELLAN STRAIT 459 freshening still
            more and more ; so that we were forced to take in our top-sails and sprit-sail. The wind
            was not a settled gale, but often varied from point to point. At noon it came at N.E.,
            and our course was then N.N.W. By a N. way we reckoned 16 leagues. November 24th. Both
            last night and this morning was foggy weather, with some calms between times. But at
            eight in the morning the sun broke out, though notwith- standing the day was not clear.
            By a N.N.E. way we reckoned 15 leagues. This morning the wind came about to E., and by
            noon it was again at N.E. We had a clear evening and a fresh gale. November 25th. All
            last night we had a fresh wind at E. and E.N.E., insomuch that at eight in the morning
            we took in our top-sails. But at noon the wind was not so fresh as it had been before. I
            reckoned a N.N.W. half W. way, and by the same 20 leagues. November 26th. Last night the
            wind was not altogether so fresh as before ; but this morning it was again very high.
            The weather was both dark and cloudy, and brought now and then rain and snow. We made a
            N.N.E. way, and hereby 30 leagues. The wind all along E. by S. and E.S.E. In the evening
            we had fair weather again. We experienced for the last ten days a great Western sea, and
            saw in the same time several seals. Sunday, November 27th. All the past night we enjoyed
            a fresh gale and clear weather. I reckoned 36 leagues by a N.E. by N. way. By
            observation lat. 52° 48' S. And I judged myself to be E. from the gulf 285 leagues. In
            the evening of this day. we had a very exact sight of the sun, and found above 30°
            variation of the needle ; whence ought to be concluded that it is very difficult to
            direct a course of navigation in these parts. For in the space of only 25 leagues saihng
            we have experienced eight or nine degrees difference of variation, by a good Dutch
            azimuth compass. November 28th. All last night we had a fresh wind at E.S.E. Towards
            morning we had but httle wind, all the day being hazy weather. This day we saw a whole
            flight of land fowls, of which sort we killed one before, as was mentioned above. This
            sight ^ave us occasion to beheve that, neither then nor at this present, were we far
            distant from land, and 46o QUEST FOR MAGELLAN STRAIT yet we descried none in the residue
            of this whole voyage. We made by a N.N.E. way 33 leagues. Yesterday in the evening we
            set a new sprit-sail, and about three this morning we also set our main-sail. At one in
            the afternoon the wind came about N.E. and N.N.E., which in the evening blew very fresh,
            with cloudy weather. November 29th. The night proved very cloudy, and the wind blew very
            fresh at E.N.E. and N.E. by E. This morning it was at E., with both snow and hail.
            Towards noon the weather cleared up, and we found by an observation taken lat. 49° 45'
            S. Our reckoning was a N. way, and 30 leagues. This day we had a short E. sea, and
            withal a very cold even- ing. I took the sun, and hereby I found variation 26° 30' to
            the N.E. This night the wind came about W. and W.N.W., continuing so all the night.
            November 30th. This day the wind was N. and N.N.E. , with some clouds hovering in the
            sky. At this time we had already almost four hours of night. The morning of this day was
            very fair and clear. Hereupon, to give myself satisfaction in the point, fearing the
            truth of Spanish books, I worked the true amplitude of the sun, and found his variation
            to be 26° 25' to the N.E., being very comformable to what I had both read and
            experimented before. Hereabouts also we experienced a current to N. Moreover, this day
            we saw much rock-weed, which renewed our hopes once more of seeing land. We reckoned a
            N.E. way, and by the same twenty-two leagues. By an observation made we found lat. 48°
            53' S. This day also we saw several of those fowl-fish afore described called paxaros
            ninos, and these of a larger size than any we had seen before. In the afternoon the wind
            came about at N.N.E. whereby we stood N.W. by W., with a fresh gale and smooth water.
            The weather now began to grow warmer than hitherto, and the evening of this day was
            clear. Tuesday, December ist. The latter part of last night was very cloudy, and also
            sometimes rainy. About midnight we had a furious and violent tornado, forcing us in a
            moment to hand in our top-sails. At five in the morning we set them again, and at eleven
            we had another tornado, forcing us to hand our top-sails the second time. We made a
            N.N.E. two-thirds E. way, and thereby 13 leagues and two-thirds. I I QUEST FOR MAGELLAN
            STRAIT 461 The afternoon of this stormy day proved very fair, and the wind came to
            W.S.W., our course being N.E. by N. In the evening the wind freshened, with cloudy
            weather. December 2nd. Last night we experienced a very furious whirlwind, which,
            notwithstanding, it pleased God, did pass about the length of our ship to W. of us.
            However, we handed in our top-sails, and hauled up our low-sails, in the brails. After
            the whirlwind came a fresh storm of large hail-stones in the night, and several
            tornadoes ; but, God be thanked, they all came large of our ship. We now made great way
            under a fore-course and sprit-sail. At four o'clock this morning our fore-sail split,
            whereby we were forced to lower our fore-yard. At half-an-hour after ten we hoisted it
            again with a furious S.W. wind. We made a N.E. by E. way, and by the same 47 leagues and
            a-half. By observation we now had lat. 46° 54' S. We reefed our fore-sail in consequence
            of the violence of the wind. But in the evening this rather increased, and we had a very
            great sea. Our standing rigging, through the fury of this gale, gave way in several
            places, but was soon mended again. December 3rd. The wind all last night was very fresh,
            with several flaws both of wind and rain at S.W. and S.W. by S. We enjoyed now very warm
            weather. This morning we set our fore-top-sail. Our reckoning gave us a N.E. half E. way
            and 45 leagues. We found lat. by observation 45° 28' S. This day at noon a large shoal
            of young porpoises came about our ship, and played up and down. December 4th. All last
            night we had a fresh gale at W.S.W. The night was clear, only that now and then we had a
            small cloud affording some rain. In the morning from four o'clock till eight it rained ;
            but then it cleared up again, with a S.W. wind and a very smooth sea. We made by a N.E.
            one quarter N. way, 39 leagues. By observation we found lat. 44° 01' S. At noon the wind
            came to S.S.W., our course then being N.N.E. This day we agreed among our- selves,
            having the consent of our Commander, to share the eight chests of money, which as yet
            were remaining unshared. Yesterday in the evening we let out the reef of our fore-sail
            and hoisted up our fore-yard. This evening I found variation 17° N.E. ^londay, December
            5th. All last night a clear night, and 462 QUEST FOR MAGELLAN STRAIT this a fair day,
            with a fresh wind at S.S.W. We reckoned a N.E. 5° N. way, and by the same 42 leagues. An
            observation gave us lat. 42° 29' S. This afternoon we shared of the chests
            above-mentioned 300 pieces-of -eight each man. I now reckoned myself to be E. from my
            departure 471 leagues and one-third. At night again we shared 22 pieces-of-eight more to
            each. December 6th. We had a clear starlight night the last, and a fair morning this
            day, with a fresh gale at S.W. At noon we took in our fore-top-sail. We reckoned a N.E.
            half N. way, and heieby 50 leagues and two-thirds. An observation taken afforded us 40°
            31' S. This evening was cloudy. December 7th. The night was both windy and cloudy. At
            one in the morning we took in our top-sails, and at three handed our sprit-sail, and so
            we scudded away before the vvdnd, which now was very fresh at West. This morning a gust
            of wind came and tore our main-sail into a hundred pieces, which made us put away before
            the wind till we could provide for that accident. My reckoning was a N.E. three-quaiters
            E. way, and by the same 33 leagues. By observation we found lat. 39° 37' S. We had now a
            great sea, and a fresh wind. At three in the afternoon we set another fore-sail, the
            first being blown to pieces. Moreover, at the same time, we furled our sprit-sail. At
            five the wind came at W.S.W. with very bad weather. This day our worthy Commander,
            Captain Sharp, had very certain inteUigence given him that on Christmas Day, which was
            now at hand, the company, or at least a great part thereof, had a design to shoot him ;
            he having appointed that day some time since to be meTry. Hereupon he made us share the
            wine amongst us, being persuaded they would scarce attempt any such thing in their
            sobriety. The wine we shared fell out to three jars to each mess. That night the wind
            increased. December 8th. Last night was both cloudy and windy, the wind often varying
            between N.W. and S.W. This morning it varied between W. and N.W. by W. About noon this
            day we brought a new main-sail to the yard, but did not set it then because there blew
            too much wind. I reckoned a N.E. half-N. way, and by the same 30 leagues. By observation
            lat. 38° 29' S. In the afternoon we had one or two squalls of wind and rain : but the
            violence of both fell astern of us. QUEST FOR MAGELLAN STRAIT 463 In the evening it blew
            again very hard. I observed this day the rising and setting of the sun, and found the
            exact variation to be 12° 15' N.E. December 9th. The night was starry, but withal very
            windy. About the bieak of day the wind came to NAV., and at seven we set our
            fore-top-sail, and stood N.N.E., with not much wind. We made since our last reckoning a
            N.PI. quarter-E. way, and 29 leagues. We found by observation lat. 37^ 30' S. The sea
            was much fallen, but our ship now began to complain of several leaks, through our
            tedious and long voyage. This afternoon we hoisted up our main-yard and set up
            back-stays and main-swifter, whose ring-bolt gave way, but was mended. In the evening of
            this day we had but little wind. December loth. The night was very clear, but till ten
            o'clock this forenoon we had no wind. Then a small breeze sprang up at N. and N. by E.
            We made an E.N.E. one-third N. way, and hereby 21 leagues. An observation gave us lat.
            37° oi' S. In the afternoon of this day our chief surgeon cut off the foot of a
            negro-boy, which was perished with cold. Now it was Uke to be bad weather again.
            Hereupon we furled our top-sails, end lay under a pair of courses. But in the evening we
            lay under a fore-sail and mizzen, with misty weather. Sunday, December nth. All last
            night we had a fresh wind at N. and sometimes at N.N.W. The weather was very cloudy with
            drizzUng rain. We made an E. way, and thereby 25 leagues. This day brought a great sea.
            About ten in the morning one of our main-shrouds gave way. In the evening fell some
            small rain. December 12th. All last night we had misty rain and but little wind — yea,
            in the morning a perfect calm. At noon came up a small gale at E.S.E. and S.E., biinging
            with it cloudy weather. We reckoned a N.E. by E. way, and by the same 18 leagues.
            Yesterday died the negro-bc^y whose kg was cut off by our surgeon, as was mentioned the
            day before. This afternoon also died another ntgro, somewhat bigger than the former,
            named Chepillo. The boy's name was Beafero. All this evening but small wind.* December
            13th. All night the wind was at E.S.E. , our course being N.N.E. At three in the morning
            it came about 464 QUEST FOR MAGELLAN STRAIT at S.S.W. and at nine at E. by N. I reckoned
            a N.E. by N. way, and 15 leagues. The weather was hazy. In the after- noon the wind was
            at N.E. our course being N.N.W. We enjoyed now a very smooth sea, and saw multitudes of
            grampuses, whales, and porpoises every day as we sailed along. December 14th. Last
            evening was cloudy ; as also the night foggy. Hereupon we took in our top-sails. At
            half-an- hour-after-three this morning, we stood N.E., the wind being then at N.N.W. At
            five we put out our top-sails again. At seven of the morning we saw a turtle floating
            upon the sea. We reckoned a N.N.E. way. This day's observation afforded us 34° 32 S'. At
            this time we had very hot weather, and great dews in the night. My whole easting I
            reckoned to be now 675 leagues and one-third. December 15th. Last night was fine with a
            great dew. The wind in the interim was between N. and N.W. I reckoned a N.E. half E.
            way, and by the same 31 leagues. We had an observation that gave us lat. 33° 46' S. At
            noon the wind came about at N.N.W., our course being N.E. We had this day a very clear
            evening, and at the same time a fresh wind. December i6th. We had a fair night and wind
            at N.N.W. and N.W. by N. This morning I took the sun at its rising, and found N.E.
            variation 20° 30'. My reckoning was a N.N.E. way, and 36 leagues and one-third. By
            observation I found lat. 32° 09' S. At noon this day the wind came about to N.W.
            December 17th. Most part of last night the wind was at N.W. as before. But towards
            morning a fine and easy gale sprang up at W.N.W. This morning we saw several dolphins
            playing upon the sea, which made us hope they would at last befriend us and suddenly
            show us some land or other. We reckoned a N.E. by N. one-third N. way, and by the same
            25 leagues. An observation gave us lat. 31° 04'. A fair evening. December i8th. We had a
            clear night, together with a smooth gale at N.W., which this morning was at W. by S. We
            had now a smooth sea for several days past. Our reckon- ing was 25 leagues, by a N.E. by
            N. way. By observation we perceived lat. 29° 48' S. QUEST FOR MAGELLAN STRAIT 465
            December 19th. A clear night and a fresh breeze at S.S.W. and S.W. by E., lasting until
            nine in the morning. Then sprang up a wind at S.E. by E. I reckoned this day a N.N.E.
            half E. way, and upon the same 30 leagues. By observation, lat. 28° 29' S. The day was
            very fair, and a smooth sea, with weather that was very hot. My whole easting I reckoned
            now to be 760 leagues. This evening I found variation 02° 50' N.E. CHAPTER XXV The
            Buccaneers continue their navigation, without seeing any land, till they arrive at the

            panions that were poor, and disperse for several countries. The author of this Journal
            arrives in England December 20th, 1681. The night before this day was some- what cloudy,
            but the weather was fair and the wind but little. At noon the wind came about N. by E.,
            our course being W.N.W. We made a N.N.W. way, and thereby as I reckoned 22 leagues. By
            an observation made we took lat. 27° 25' S. The evening of this day was cloudy, and now
            and then there fell a shower of rain. December 21st. At eight o'clock last night the
            wind came N.W. by N., but with such dark weather that we were forced to take in our
            top-sails. The night was somewhat rainy, and the weather this morning calm and rainy.
            About ten we had a small breeze at N.W. We reckoned a N. by E. way, and by the same 16
            leagues. The afternoon of this day was calm and still. December 22nd. We had a fair and
            clear night which produced this day a smooth sea and extremely hot weather, and very
            little wind near the sun ; so that no observation was made. December 23rd. The night was
            very fair. At midnight, or thereabouts, a fresh gale sprang up at S.E. and E.S.E., which
            sometime was E. This freshened by degrees. We had in the day very hot and clear weather.
            By a N. way I reckoned 15 leagues. December 24th. Last night we had both a fresh gale
            and a clear night. The wind was at E. by S. We reckoned a N.E. by E. way, and by it 31
            leagues. 466 THEY CONTINUE THEIR VOYAGE 467 Sunday, December 25th. This day being
            Christmas day, for celebration of that great festival we killed yesterday in the evening
            a sow. This sow we had brought from the Gulf of Nicoya, being then a sucking-pig of
            three weeks old, more or less, but now weighed about fourscorc-and-ten pounds. With this
            hog's flesh we made our Christmas dinner, being the only flesh we had eaten ever since
            we turned away our prizes under the equinoctial and left the island of Plata. We had
            this day several flaws of wind and some rain, but the weather otherwise was pretty
            clear. I reckoned a N. by E. way, and 33 leagues by the same. It was now also extremely
            hot weather, as we signified before. December 26th. We had this day several gusts of
            wind, which forced us to stand by our top-sails. Yet were they but very short, and all
            the rest of the while we enjoyed an indifferent fresh gale at E. and E. by S. We
            reckoned a N. by E. way, and 28 leagues. December 27th. We had fair weather, and a fresh
            wind at E. and E. by S. I reckoned a N. by E. way, and upon the same 32 leagues. The
            evening of this day was cloudy. December 28th. Last night was cloudy, with a fresh wind.
            We reckoned a N.E. way, and by the same 46 leagues. We found by observation lat. 15° 30'
            S. My whole easting I reckoned this day to be 825 leagues. Now we saw much flying fish,
            with some dolphins, bonitos, and albicores ; but they will not take the hook. December
            29th. All last night was cloudy, with a fresh wind between E. and E.S.E. The weather all
            the afternoon was hazy. I reckoned a N. by E. way, and hereupon 40 leagues and
            one-third. In the afternoon we had a S.E. by E. wind, which blew very fresh. The evening
            was clear. At sunset I found variation to N.W. 04° 19'. December 30th. Last night was
            cloudy. Towards morning the wind came about at E. At six it came E.S.E., and at ten to
            S.E. by S. We made a N. by E. way, and 43 leagues. By observation lat. 11° 03' S. The
            evening of this day was clear. December 31st. We had a cloudy night, but the morning was
            hazy. We came now to a strict allowance of only three good pints of water each day. We
            made a N. by E. way, lat. by observation 08° 55' S. In the afternoon we had an E.S.E.
            468 THEY CONTINUE THEIR VOYAGE and S.E. by E. wind. My whole easting I reckoned now to
            be 884 leagues and one-third. At noon we stood away N.W. Sunday, January ist, 1682. All
            last night was cloudy, as this day also, with some showers of rain. We made a N.W.
            one-eighth N. way, and 40 leagues. In the afternoon came about a fresh wind at S.E. and
            E.S.E. January 2nd. The weather this day was both dull and cloudy. We reckoned a N.W.
            one-quarter N. way, and by the same 32 leagues. By observation lat. 06° 06' S. The wind
            came pretty fresh at S.E. January 3rd. We had several squalls of wind, and some rain.
            But withal a fresh wind at S.E. and E.S.E. Our reckoning was a N.W. one-quarter N. way,
            and 34 leagues. The afternoon was clear, but the evening cloudy. January 4th. All last
            night was very cloudy, but this forenoon it cleared up. Yesterday we put abroad our
            main- top-sail studding-sails ; but took them in at night. At four this morning we set
            our larboard studding-sail, and before noon fitted up top-gallant masts and yards. We
            made a N.W. way, and by it 40 leagues and two-thirds. By observation, lat. 03° 09' S.
            This afternoon also we set our top-gallant sail, being forced to make out all its
            running rigging. The wind was pretty fresh at S.E. and S.E. by E. January 5th. Most part
            of the past night was clear and starlight, though with some rain towards the morning.
            This being come, we put out our top-gallant sail, and both our top-sail studding-sails.
            At noon Ukewise we put up our fore-top-gallant mast and yard. We caught an albicore this
            day, weighing about 120 pounds. The wind was at S.E. by S. and S.S.E. We made a N.W.
            way, and reckoned thereby 35 leagues. By observation, lat. 02° 03' S. We had now mighty
            hot weather. January 6th. Yesterday in the evening we caught another albicore, which
            weighed only eight or nine pounds. We made a N.W. way, and reckoned 35 leagues as
            before. By observation, lat. 00° 49' S. The evening of this day was very clear. January
            7th. The wind was variable between S.S.E. and S.S.W., though not altogether so fresh as
            before. Our reckon- ing was a N.W. one-quarter N. way, and 36 leagues by the same. This
            day an observation gave us lat. 00° 32' N. of THEY CONTINUE THEIR VOYAGE 469 the
            equinoctial, which now we had passed again. In the afternoon of this day we caught
            another albicore, which weighed more than the first we took, that is between 135 and 140
            pounds. But Httle wind stirring this afternoon. January 8th. Last evening we had httle
            better than a calm. At nine this morning we had a fresh wind at S.S.E. with dark
            weather, so that we thought it convenient to take in our main-topsail. But at noon we
            set it again, and also our larboard top-studding-sail, with both top-gallant sails. We
            made a N.W. way, and by it 34 leagues. By observation lat. 01° 55' N. We had now
            extremely hot weather, and a very small allowance of water. January 9th. Last night we
            took in top-sails all night, the wind then whiffling between S. and W. We had notwith-
            standing for the most part very little wind. The morning of this day was rainy, and
            thereupon with good diligence we saved a bumpkin of water ^. There was now a great
            rippUng sea, rising very high ; and it is reported that sometimes and somewhere
            hereabouts is to be seen an enchanted island, which others say, and dare assert, that
            they have sailed over. I reckoned a N.W. by N. one-quarter N. way, and 25 leagues. This
            afternoon we had very dark and calm weather, looking as if we should have much rain.
            Now, reckoning up my meridian, I found myself E. from my departure 702 leagues. In the
            evening we had very rainy weather and a cockHng sea. January 10 th. All last night was
            cloudy. About mid- night sprang up a small breeze varying all round the compass. At five
            this morning we had a breeze at S.E. and a very clear sky, which afterwards continued to
            freshen, with the same clearness as before. We made a N.W. by N. one-quarter N. way, and
            by the same 2 leagues and two-thirds. By clear observation lat. 03° 16' N. At four this
            evening the wind was at E.S.E., the weather being violent hot, insomuch that our
            allowance of water was tedious to us for its shortness. At the same time we had an
            indifferent smooth sea from the E. January nth. All last night we had Httle or no wind.
            But about two in the morning the wind freshened again at * A nautical term for a vessel

            VOYAGE E.N.E., and brought both a clear and hot day. We made 23 leagues by a N.W.
            one-quarter W. way. This day's observation gave us lat. 04° 06' N. In the afternoon we
            had a shower of rain, and afterwards a fresh wind at E.N.E, But the evening grew dull.
            January 12th. Last night we had two or three squalls of wind and some showers of rain.
            In the meanwhile the wind blew fresh at N.E. and N.E. by E., as it also continued to do
            in the day. I reckoned a N.W. way, and 44 leagues and one-third. Our observation this
            day gave us 05° 49' N. Yesterday and to-day we set our main-top-sail. Now I could not
            find much variation of the needle. January 13th. We had a fresh gale all last night, but
            more northerly than before, for now it was N.E. by N. We reckoned a W.N.W. way. An
            observation showed lat. 06° 41' N. We had a N.N.E. sea and very clear weather. January
            14th. We had a clear night, and a fresh wind at E.N.E. We made a N.W. one-fifth W. way,
            and 38 leagues. By observation lat. 07° 46' N. We had a smooth sea ; and now we were
            come to only three horns of water a day, which made in all but a quart allowance for
            each man. The evening was clear, and we had a fresh wind. Sunday, January 15th. Last
            night was clear, and the wind fresh at E.N.E., and again at N.E. by E. very fresh. At
            about eleven o'clock at night there died one of our com- panions, named WiUiam Stephens.
            It was commonly believed that he poisoned himself with manQanilla in Golfo Dulce, for he
            never had been in health since that time. This fore- noon was cloudy. We reckoned 44
            leagues and a N.W. way. An observation gave us this day 09° 18' N. All last night we
            kept out our top-gallant sails. We saw hereabouts many flying fish, being very large in
            size. This morning also we threw overboard our dead man, and gave him two French volleys
            and one English one. I found now again very small variation. January i6th. We had a
            clear night and a very fresh wind at N.E. and E.N.E., with a long, homing sea. My
            reckoning was a N.W. one-seventh W. way, and thereby 48 leagues and one-third. The
            observation made this day gave us lat. 10° 48' N. I reckoned myself now E. from my
            departure 553 leagues, We had a very cloudy evening. THEY CONTINUE THEIR VOYAGE 471
            January 17th. All last night we enjoyed a fresh wind, and so this day also, at N.E. by
            N. We made a N.W. half W. way, and thereupon 47 leagues and one-third. By observa- tion
            we found lat. 12° 19' N. We had now a long north sea. At noon this day we steered away
            N.N.W. The day was very hot, but the night both cool and dewy. January i8th. All last
            night was both cloudy and windy. At six this morning our sprit-sail top-mast broke. I
            reckoned a W.N.W. way, and 48 leagues by the same. We found by observation, lat. 13° 12'
            N. At noon we steered away W., the wind being at N.E. fresh, with a clear evening.
            January 19th. We had a clear night and a fresh wind at E.N.E., which sometimes came in
            pushes. Our reckoning was a W. half S. way, and by the same 46 leagues. We found by
            observation lat. 13° 01' N. Yesterday in the evening we put up a new sprit-sail top-mast
            ; with a fine, smooth gale at N.E. by E. January 20th. Last night was clear, and not
            very fresh, but at daybreak it freshened again. Last night we saw a great shoal of fish,
            whereof we caught none, by reason the porpoises frightened them from us, as they
            ofttimes had done before. Yesterday in the evening also we saw a man-of- war fowU, and
            that gave us good hopes we should e'er long see land. These hopes, and the great desires
            we had to end our voyage, gave us occasion this day to put in, or stake down, each man
            of our company a piece-of-eight for a reward to him that should first discover land. We
            reckoned a W. one-sixth N. way, and by it 38 leagues. An observation gave us this day
            lat. 13° 11' N. The wind was at N.E. and E.N.E. This day we passed over many ripphngs,
            and also saw many multitudes of fish ; but the porpoises did always hinder us from
            having any good of them. January 21st. We made a W. way, and reckoned 47 leagues. By
            observation we found lat. 13° 07' N. The wind at E.N.E. ; thence came a long sea. The
            evening very clear. January 22nd. We had a fair and a clear day, the wind being at E. We
            reckoned a W. by N. one-third W. way and 40 leagues. An observation showed us lat. 13°
            17' N. We had a clear evening, and a fresh wind at E.N.E. January 23rd. This day was
            both clear and hot, with a 1 The frigate-bird ; also called the sea-hawk. 472 THEY SIGHT
            LAND fresh wind at E.N.E. My reckoning was a W. way, and 46 leagues. Our observation
            this day afforded us lat. 13° 15' N. In the evening we had some rain. January 24th. This
            day brought us Ukewise clear weather, such as the day before. I reckoned a W. way, and
            40 leagues and one-third. By observation we found lat. 13° 12' N. The afternoon was
            cloudy, and had some rain, the wind freshening at E.N.E. and at E. by N. I reckoned now
            that I was E. from my departure 311 leagues. We had a cloudy evening. January 25th. Both
            last night and this morning the weather was cloudy. This morning we saw several tropical
            birds of divers sorts. Our reckoning was a W. three-quarters N. way, and 43 leagues. We
            found by observation lat. 13° 29' N. This afternoon we saw a booby ^ flying close aboard
            the horizon. The weather was hazy. But now we began to look out sharp on all sides for
            land, expecting to see it every minute. I reckoned myself to be E. of my departure 268
            leagues. January 26th. Last night was indifferent clear. Yet, notwithstanding, this
            morning we had a smart shower of rain, and it was very windy. Hereupon we furled our
            sprit- sail, the weather being very hazy to W. We reckoned a W. way, and thereby 46
            leagues and one-third. By observation, lat. 13° 17' N. At noon this day we had a very
            fierce tornado and rain together, but a clear afternoon. We had a high E.N.E. sea, and
            saw multitudes of flying -fish, and amongst these two or three boobies. The evening was
            hazy. January 27th. All last night we had a fresh wind, and clear weather. This morning
            our fore-top-mast backstay gave way, and at daybreak the star-board sheet of our fore-
            top-sail broke. We had several tornadoes this day, and dark weather. Our reckoning was a
            W. way, and 48 leagues by the same. We had a clear evening and a dark night. This day
            also a certain bird called, a noddy 2, came on board us, which we took for a certain
            token that we were not now very far from land. Saturday, January 28th. We had a very
            clear night. About an hour before day one of our company happened to descry land, which
            proved to be the Island of Barbados, ^ The brown gannet, sula cyanops. * The tern,
            sterna stolida. LIBERATION OF THEIR NEGRO 473 at S.S.W. from us, and at 2 leagues and
            a-half distance, more or less. Hereupon we clapped on a wind, N. and by W. At daybreak
            we were only 4 leagues distant from Chalky Mount, at which time we stood S.W. by S. As
            we sailed we saw several ships at anchor in Spikes Road. Soon after a shallop passed by,
            between us and the shore, but would not come within call of us. Hereupon we stood in,
            within a mile of the shore, and made a wiff to a pinnace which we saw coming out of the
            road aforementioned. She came close aboard us, and, as it should seem, was the barge of
            one of his Majesty's frigates, the Richmond, then lying at the Bridge- town at anchor.
            They told us of peace at home, but would not come on board us, though often invited
            thereto. Neither dared we be so bold as to put in there at Barbados, for, hearing of a
            frigate lying there, we feared lest the said frigate should seize us for privateers and
            for having acted in all our voyage without commission. Thus we stood away thence for the
            island of Antigua. Here I cannot easily express the infinite joy we were possessed with
            this day to see our own countrymen again. They told us that a ship which we saw in the
            offing to leeward of the island was a Bristol-man, and an interloper ; but we feared
            that same vessel to be the frigate aforementioned. I reckoned a way of 25 leagues, so
            that I was now by my account to eastward of my departure 150 leagues. Now we stood N. by
            W., and by observation found lat. 13° 17' N., we being then N.W. from the body of the
            island of Barbados between 7 and 8 leagues. This afternoon we freed the negro who was
            our shoemaker by trade, giving him his liberty for the good service he had done us in
            all the course of this voyage. We gave also to our good Commander, Captain Sharp, a
            mulatto- boy, as a free gift of the whole company, to wait upon him, in token of the
            respect we all were owing to him for the safety of our conduct through so many dangerous
            adventures. This being done, we shared some small parcels of money that had not as yet
            been touched of our former prizes ; and this dividend amounted to 24 pieces-of-eight
            each man. At one o'clock this day from our fore-yard we descried the island of St Lucia,
            being one of the Western Islands, not far distant from that of Barbados. I had omitted
            to tell a passage which happened in our ship on Thursday last, 474 THEY REACH CARIBBEAN
            ISLANDS which was the 26th day of this month and just two days before we made the island
            of Barbados. On that day, there- fore, a Httle Spanish shock-dog 1, which we had found
            in our last wine-prize taken under the equinoctial and had kept aUve till now, was sold
            at the mast by public cry for 40 pieces- of-eight, his owner saying that all he could
            get for him should be spent upon the company at a pubUc merriment. Our Commander,
            Captain Sharp, bought the dog, with intention to eat him, in case we did not see land
            very soon. This money, therefore, with 100 pieces-of-eight more, which our boatswain,
            carpenter, and quartermaster had refused to take at this last dividend, for some quarrel
            they had against the sharers thereof, was all laid up in store till we came to land,
            with the intent of spending it ashore at a common feast or drinking-bout. At sunset the
            island of St Lucia bore W.S.W. from us, and was at 10 leagues distance. Also the island
            of Martinique bore N.W. by W. of us at 12 or 13 leagues distance. We had this day a very
            clear evening, Sunday, January 29th. We had a clear night, and a fresh wind at E. by N.
            and at E.N.E. Our reckoning was a N.N.W. half-W. way, and hereby 46 leagues. By
            observation we took lat. 15° 46' N. At noon this day we saw the island named La
            Desirade, or The Desired Island, which then bore N.W. from us, and seemed to be at 8
            leagues distance, more or less. At six o'clock in the evening we saw likewise
            Mariegalante, another of the Caribbee Islands, at S.W. by W. from us, and that of
            Guadaloupe, streaking itself in several hummocks of land, both W. and N. ; as also La
            Desirade above-mentioned at S.E., which from there shows like tableland, and at each end
            has a low point running out. At six this evening it was W.S.W., and at 5 or 6 leagues
            distance from us. At the same time we saw the island of Montserrat at a great distance
            from our ship and making three round hummocks close together. This evening Hkewise we
            caught an albicore of twenty pound weight. Monday, January 30th. We had a fair night all
            the last past, and a fresh wind. Hereupon all night we hauled up our main-sail in
            brails, standing at the same time N. by W., ^ A small rough-coated dog : cf. " What a
            terrible bandog [bound- dog ; for fierceness] do's she make of it, | Which other ladies
            play with as familiarly | As with their shocks or Bononia dogs." — Erminia [1661].
            DISPERSAL OF THE BUCCANEERS 475 with the wind at E.N.K. At midnight we stood N.W. At
            three in the morning we lay by until five. Then we stood away W.N.W. until six, and at
            that hour we stood W. At eight o'clock we saw the island of Antigua, called by us
            Antego, to the S. of us, making three round hummocks of land, and a long high hill to N.
            Hereupon we stood W.S.W. for it. At noon we found lat. 17° N., the island being then
            just W. from us. We came about to the S. of the island, and sent a canoe on shore to get
            tobacco and other necessaries that we wanted, as also to ask leave of the Governor to
            come into the port. The gentry of the place and common people were very willing and
            desirous to receive us. But on Wednesday, February ist, the Governor flatly denied us
            entry — at which all the gentry were much grieved, and showed themselves very kind to
            us. Hereupon we agreed among ourselves to give away and leave the ship to them of our
            company who had no money left of all their purchase in this voyage, having lost it all
            at play ; and then to divide ourselves into two ships, which were now bound for England.
            Thus I myself and thirteen more of our company went on board Captain Robert Porteen's
            ship, called the Lisbon Merchant, and set sail from Antigua on February nth, and landed
            at Dartmouth in England, March 26th, anno 1682, </p>
