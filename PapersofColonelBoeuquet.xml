            FAME SHALL NEVER KNOW HER STORY, HER HEART HAS SHED A DROP AS DEAR AS E'ER BEDEWED THE
            FIELD OF GLORY." COL HENRY BOUQUET HIS CAMPAIGNS OF 1763 AND 1764.</writing> Fort Pitt, May 29,
            1763. Sir. — A large party of Mingoes arrived at the beginning of the month and gave up
            to us ten horses of poor quality. They asked me for presents, but I refused everything
            they had to offer except eight inerits of Indian corn, ( i. e.: 24 bushels, C. C, )
            which they planted opposite Crogans' house, where they have built a town. In the evening
            of the day before yesterday, Mr. McKee reported to me that the Mingoes and Delawares
            were in motion, and had sold in a great hurry skins to the value of ^300., with which
            they bought as much powder and lead as they pleased. Yesterday I sent him to their towns
            to get information, but he AND HIS CAMPAIGNS. 2$ found them entirely abandoned, and
            followed their trail and si certain that they have gone down the river, which makes me
            think that they want to interrupt our boats and close the passage against us. They stole
            three horses and a cask of rum at Bushy Run. They even robbed a man named Coleman of
            £^o, ( on the Bedford road, ) holding their guns against his body. I am assured that the
            famous Wolfe and Butler were the chiefs ; it is clear that they want to break with us. I
            pity the poor people on the communication. I am at work to put this post in the best
            position possible with the few people I have. Just as I was finish- ing my letter, three
            men came from Clapham's with the melan- choly news that yesterday, at three o'clock in
            the afternoon, the Indians murdered Clapham and everybody in his house. These three men
            were at work outside and escaped through the woods. I gave them arms and sent them to
            aid our people at Bushy Run. The Indians have told Byerly ( at Bushy Run ) to leave his
            house within four days, or he and all his family would be murdered. I tremble for the
            small posts. As for this one, I will answer for it. S. ECUYER. If you do not often get
            letters from me, it will be a proof that the communication is cut. To Colottel Bouquet.
            From this time until the tenth of August, the garrison was cooped up in the fort, and
            communications cut off. THE FLIGHT OF THE BYERLYS TO FORT LIGONIER. Tet US take another
            look at Bushy Run before we dwell upon the siege of Fort Pitt. As Ecuyer states, Byerly
            had received warning, but his family was in no condition to be moved. Mrs. Byerly had
            just been confined and the departure was delayed as long as possible, indeed until
            certain death was imminent if the flight should be any longer postponed. Byerly had gone
            with a small party (perhaps Clapham's men referred to above) to bury some persons who
            had been killed at some distance from his station. A friendly Indian who had often
            received a bowl of milk and bread from Mrs. Byerly came to the house after dark and
            informed the family that they would all be killed if they did not make their escape
            before daylight. Mrs. Byerly got up from her sick couch and wrote the tidings on the
            door of the 24 COL. HENRY BOUQUET house for the information of her husband when he
            should return. A horse was saddled on which the mother with her tender babe three days
            old in her arms was placed, and a child not two years old was fastened behind her.
            Michael Byerly was a good sized lad, but Jacob was only three years old and had a
            painful stone bruise on one of his feet. With the aid of his older brother who held him
            by the hand and sometimes carried him on his back, the little fellow, however, managed
            to make good time through the wilderness to Fort Ligonier about thirty miles distant.
            But although he reached his ninety-ninth year he never forgot that race for life in his
            childhood, nor did he feel like giving quarters to hostile Indians, one of whom he.
            killed on an island in the Alleghany in a fight under Lieutenant Hardin in 1779,
            although the savage begged for quarters. Milk cows were highly prized by frontier
            families in those days, and the Byerly family made a desperate effort to coax and drive
            their small herd along to Fort Ligonier. But the howling savages got so close that they
            were obliged to leave the cattle in the woods to be destroyed by the Indians. Byerly in
            some way eluded the Indians and joined his family in the retreat. They barely escaped
            with their lives. The first night they spent in the stock- ade, and in the morning the
            bullets of the pursuers struck the gates as the family pressed into the fort. Here they
            were compelled to remain two months, exposed to great privations and repeated assaults
            of Indians. Fort Pitt would have been nearer and preferable as a place of safety had it
            been possible to reach it. As it was they had to choose the longer road and the weaker
            fort as the only chance of escape from the red demons. At Fort Pitt Capt. Ecuyer put
            everything in the best possible shape for defence. The garrison consisted of 330
            soldier, traders and backwoodsmen, who were armed and drilled for the emergency. There
            were also about one hundred women in the fort and a still greater number of children.
            **A hospital was constructed under the drawbridge, out of range of musket shot, for
            patients suffering from small- pox, and tlie captain was very apprehensive that disease
            AND HIS CAMPAIGNS. 25 would break out in epidemic form as a result of the over- crowded
            condition of the fort. He seemed to have no fear of losing the fort. A letter, written
            at the time, says, " we are in such a good posture of defence that with God's assistance
            we can defend it against a thousand Indians." Careful preparation was made for an
            attack. Buildings outside of the ramparts were levelled to the ground, and every morning
            at an hour before dawn the drum beat and the troops were ordered to their alarm posts. A
            heavy guard was kept on duty night and day. " I am deter- mined to hold my post, spare
            my men and never expose them without necessity. This is what I think you require of me,"
            wrote the brave and judicious Ecuyer to Bouquet. It was next thing to death to expose a
            head on the ram- parts, or to wander outside the fortification. Lurking savages were at
            hand to pick off the unwary. On the 25th of June, the Indians captured a lot of horses
            and cattle, belonging to the fort. A general fire was then opened on the fort from all
            sides. A discharge of howitzers threw them into confusion and made them act more
            cautiously. Next morning, Turtle Heart, a Dela- ware chief, approached the fort in the
            guise of friendship, and advised the commander and garrison to withdraw and take the
            women and children down to the English settle- ments, in order to escape destruction
            from the six great nations of Indians, who were coming to destroy them. He promised that
            they would be protected in making their escape. This was the ruse by which so many
            traders and smaller posts had been deceived and finally treacherously murdered after
            they had given up their arms. But Ecuyer was not to be caught with such chaff. He
            replied in a very ironical way, thanking the Delaware brothers for their great kindness,
            and assuring them that he and his troops could hold the fort against all the Indians
            that dared to attack it. " We are very well off in this place, and we mean to stay,"
            said he. He then told them in confidence that two great armies were coming, one from the
            East and the other from the Lakes, to destroy the bad Indians, while the Cherokees and
            Catawbas, their old enemies, B 26 COL. HENRY BOUQUET were joining a third army in
            Virginia to destroy them. This speech seemed to have a demoralizing effect upon the
            savages, who withdrew for a season to meet a large body of warriors approaching from the
            west. During this interval Ensign Price, from Fort Le Boeuf, entered Fort Pitt with his
            command of a dozen men, who had gallantly defended their little post until it was in
            flames from burn- ing arrows and had then cut their way out of the rear and escaped
            after great peril and suffering. The names of this detachment of Royal Americans, as far
            as given, indi- cate their German descent, viz. : Fisher, Nash, Dogood, Nigley,
            Dortinger and Trunk. Captain Ecuyer strength- ened his defences with a line of
            palisades, and constructed a rude fire engine to extinguish flames caused by the burning
            arrows of the Indians shot against the sides and roofs of wooden buildings. July 26, a
            small party of In- dians came to parley, under the lead of Shingas and Turtle Heart.
            They professed great affection for the whites, and great concern for their safety. The
            Ottawas were coming in great force from Detroit to destroy the garrison, and they begged
            their white brothers to depart while it could be done in safety. Ecuyer replied that he
            could defend the fort for three years against all the Indians in the woods, and that he
            would never abandon it as long as a white man lived in America. He despised the Otta-
            was, and warned his Delaware brothers to keep out of reach of his bombshells and cannon
            loaded with a whole bag full of bullets. Thwarted in their crafty and treach- erous
            schemes by which they had succeeded in destroying Lieutenant Gordon and his entire
            command at Venango, the Indians began a general attack in earnest. Many of them dug
            holes in the river banks, from which to fire on the fort, and from all sides bullets and
            arrows flew thick and fast. The Royal Americans and border riflemen from their loopholes
            drew a bead on every Indian that exposed his person in the least. Ecuyer was wounded in
            the leg by an arrow, but kept up the hopes and spirits of his men, while at the same
            time he refused to let them sally forth to engage in a hand to hand conflict with the
            savages, as many of them proposed to do. The attack lasted five AND HIS CAMPAIGNS. 27
            days and five nights. Ecuyer speaks with great admira- tion of the conduct of his men —
            " regulars and the rest." " I am fortunate to have the honor of commanding such brave
            men. I only wish the Indians had ventured an assault. They would have remembered it to
            the thou- sandth generation." Bouquet wrote General Amherst, August II, in terms of high
            praise of Ecuyer for the defence of the fort and the important additions made to the
            fortifications during the investment. In various letters, written from the fort
            immediately after the siege was raised, it is stated that '* to a man they were resolved
            to defend the position ( if the troops had not arrived ) as long as any amunition and
            provisions to sup- port them was left ; and that then they would have fought their way
            through or died in the attempt, rather than have been made prisoners by such perfidious,
            cruel and blood- thirsty hell-hounds. Some of the women in the fort, it is said, helped
            to defend the place. Many express-riders going to and from the garrison have been
            killed." DEFENCE OF FORT LIGONIER. At Fort Ligonier matters were even more critical than
            at Fort Pitt. The stockade was bad and the garrison extre- mely weak but Byerly and a
            few other frontier settlers had made their way into it with their families and helped to
            re- pulse the assaults of the savages. Lieutenant Archibald Blane with a detatchment of
            Royal Americans was in com- mand, and conducted the defense with great courage and
            practical tact. On the 4th of June Blane writes : " Thursday last my garrison was
            attacked by a body of Indians, about five in the morning ; but as they only fired upon
            us from the skirts of the woods, I contented myself with giving them three cheers,
            without spending a single shot upon them. But as they still continued their popping upon
            the. side next to the town, I sent the sergeant of the Royal Americans with a proper
            detachment to fire the houses, which effectually dis- appointed them in their plan." On
            the 17th, he writes to Bouquet, "I hope soon to see «^**"" I/. 28 COL. HENRY BOUQUET
            yourself and live in daily hopes of a reinforcement. * * Sunday last a man straggling
            out was killed by the Indians. * * I believe the communication between Fort Pitt and
            this place is entirely cut off, not having heard from them since the thirtieth of May,
            though two expresses have gone from Bedford to that post." On the 21st the Indians made
            a serious attack for two hours. A small party of fifteen men were so exceedingly anxious
            to have a closer tilt with the savages that the lieutenant finally yielded to their
            entreaties to let them out to attack some Indians that showed themselves at a little
            distance. As it turned out this was only a decoy to entrap them. About a hundred savages
            lay in ambush by the side of the creek about four hundred yards from the fort ; and just
            as the party was returning near where they lay, the savages rushed out to cut them off
            and would have succeeded in doing so had it not been for a deep morass which intervened.
            Foiled in this movement, more by natural obstacles then by the judg- ment or sagacity of
            the whites, the Indians immediately began an attack upon the fort and fired upwards of a
            thou- sand shots without doing any special damage. Bouquet was deeply concerned for the
            safety of Fort Ligonier, for on its preservation depended the safety of Fort Pitt and
            his own army of deliverance. A large quan- tity of military stores were in the magazines
            at Ligonier, with which the Indians might have blown up Fort Pitt or reduced Bouquet's
            troops to the greatest extremities. A picked party of thirty Highlanders was sent by a
            circu- itous route through the woods traveling by night at their utmost speed under the
            escort of experienced guides. They got close to the fort without being discovered and
            then by a sudden rush and a running fight they managed to get in without losing a man.
            This was a timely relief and ensured the safety of the post until the main body could
            arrive. Next to Ligonier in the line of communication came Fort Bedford, at a distance
            of fifty miles across the mount- ains and through the wilderness. Captain Lewis Ourry
            was in command here with a mere handful of Royal Ameri- cans. On the third of June he
            wrote Bouquet that owing AND HIS CAMPAIGNS. 29 to the arrival of express riders, ( who
            were generally sold- iers sent from one post to another at the peril of their lives,)
            his regulars were increased to " three corporals and nine privates." But he had a large
            body of settlers who, fright- ened by depredations of the Indians in the neighborhood,
            rushed pell-mell to the fort. These he organized into two military companies,
            aggregating 150 men. Over one hun- dred families had sought refuge at the fort. When the
            scare was over for the time being the silly people would ven- ture out in small squads,
            and many were thus cut off and slain by scalping parties of skulking savages. June
            seventh he writes, "I long to see my Indian scouts come in with intelligence ; but I
            long more to hear the Grenadiers march and see more red-coats." Ten days later the
            country people in fancied security had returned to their plantation so that Ourry was
            left alone with a garrison of only twelve Royal Americans, who had not only to guard the
            fort but likewise take care of seven Indian prisoners. He writes to Bouquet : " I should
            be very glad to see some troops come to my assistance. A fort with five bas- tions
            cannot be guarded much less defended by a dozen men, but I hope God will protect us."
            The killing and scalping of some families on Denning's creek threw the settlers into a
            panic again, and in a few days the militia were back from their farms and with
            difficulty could be prevented from murdering the Indian prisoners. Ourry feared that the
            Indians, despairing of taking Fort Pitt, would fall upon and destroy the smaller posts
            and ravage the settlements, which they doubtless would have done had Bouquet's advance
            been much longer delayed. July 2d, about twenty Indians attacked a party of mowers and
            killed several of them. Eighteen persons in all were killed near Fort Bedford. July 3,
            Ourry received word from Blane of the loss of Presque Isle on Lake Erie, Le- boeuf,
            Venango, etc., which he sends to Bouquet with the intimation that Blane had entertained
            some idea of evacu- ating or capitulating Fort Ligonier. Bouquet replied '- *' I
            shivered when you hinted to me Lieut. Bl — 's inten- tions. Death and infamy would have

            may be sure that all the expedi- tion possible will be used for the relief of the few
            remain- ing posts." Parkman remarks on the above letter : " Bouquet had the strongest
            reason for wishing that Fort Ligonier should hold out. As the event showed its capture
            would proba- bly have entailed the defeat and destruction of his entire command." THE
            SITUATION AT CARLISLE. Bouquet had his headquarters in Philadelphia as Colonel of the
            first battallion of Royal Americans at the time of the outbreak of Pontiac and his
            confederates. His Royal Americans, broken into detachments, had held the line of forts
            and posts between that place and Detroit for over six years. As military hermits they
            held the outposts of civilization in the Western wilderness. Bouquet, as we have seen,
            was held in high esteem in Philadelphia. He was in the prime of life, had a fine
            personal pres- ence, splendid physique and extraordinary qualities of mind and heart. "
            Firmness, integrity, calmness, pres- ence of mind in the greatest of dangers — virtues
            so essen- tial to a commander, were natural to him. His presence inspired confidence and
            impressed respect, encouraged his friends and confounded his foes." Such is the esti-
            mate given of Bouquet by some of the best men of the provinces who knew him well. He
            promptly reported the situation to General Amherst as Ecuyer had informed him in letters
            written at the end of May. The haughty and arrogant Briton could not believe that the
            despicable savages would be so audacious as to besiege his forts or attack regular
            troops of equal numbers with their own. It is amusing to read his brag and bluster and
            to mark the change which in some respects seems to come over the spirit of his dream as
            the campaign progresses. Bouquet evidently knew his weak and strong points and knew how
            to secure his hearty co-operation in measures necessary to the success of the
            beleaguered garrisons. AND HIS CAMPAIGNS. 3 1 June 23, Amherst ordered Major Campbell to
            proceed at once from New York to Philadelphia with the remains of the 42d Regiment of
            Royal Highlanders, and of the 77th Montgomery's Highlanders ; the first consisting of
            two hundred and fourteen men, including officers, and the lat- ter of one hundred and
            thirty-three. These troops had just landed from the West Indies and were in a very ema-
            ciated condition, most of them really unfit for service. The remains of five more such
            regiments arrived from Havana July 29, numbering in all nine hundred and eighty- two men
            and officers fit for duty ; but by this time Bou- quet was beyond Fort Bedford. Amherst
            seemed incap- able of comprehending the magnitude of the danger. " If you think it
            necessary " he writes to Bouquet " you will youself proceed to Fort Pitt that you may be
            better enabled to put in execution the requisite orders for secur- ing the communication
            and reducing the Indians to rea- son." Bouquet was not the man to shirk duty or danger
            in such a crisis. With all the enegy of his ardent and indomitable nature he threw
            himself into the work of pre- paring an expedition for the relief of the invested forts
            and the exposed frontiers. He sent forward orders for the collection of stores and
            transportation at Carlisle as soon as the outlook became serious. After making the
            necessary arrangements at Philadel- phia, he hastened toward Carlisle. At Lancaster he
            writes to Amherst expressing confidence in his ability to open up communication with the
            troops sent to his assistance. Amherst replies " I wish to hear of no prisoners, should
            any of the villains be met with in arms." On the 3d of July Bouquet received what he
            calls the " fatal account of the loss of our posts at Presque Isle, Leboeuf and Ve-
            nango." The express rider who brought the message from Bedford came through in one day.
            He told the dis- astrous news to the country people who flocked about him and remarked,
            as he rode towards Bouquet's tent, " the In- dians will be here soon." All was
            consternation and alarm. Word was sent out to the settlements and soon every road was
            filled with panic-stricken fugitives crowding into Carlisle. The In- 3 2 COL. HENR Y
            BOUQ UET dians were raiding through the Juniata regions and along the borders of the
            Cumberland valley. A scouting party- found Shearman's valley laid waste, the dwellings
            and stacked grain on fire, and swine devouring the bodies of slaughtered settlers.
            Twelve young men went to warn the people of the Tuscarora valley. They found the work of
            ruin in full blast already and fell into an ambush in which they were nearly all killed.
            The country between the mountains and the Susque- hanna was abandoned. Two thousand
            families left their homes and fled to the forts and larger towns for protec- tion. A
            letter written from Carlisle, July 5, 1763, gives us an idea of the terrible panic which
            existed. " Nothing could exceed the terror which prevailed from house to house and from
            town to town. The road was near covered with women and children flying to Lancaster and
            Philadelphia. The Rev. , pastor of the Episcopal church, went at the head of his
            congregation to protect and encourage them on the way. A few retired to the breastworks
            for safety. The alarm once given could not be appeased. We have done all that men can do
            to prevent disorder. All our hopes are turned upon Bouquet." Instead of finding sup-
            plies at hand for his troops and for the relief of the forts, Bouquet found a vast crowd
            of despairing and starving people, while crops were being burnt and mills destroyed on
            all sides. July 13th, Bouquet wrote Amherst from Carlisle as follows : " The list of the
            people, known to be killed, increases very fast every hour. The desolation of so many
            families reduced to the last extremity of want and misery ; the de- spair of those who
            have lost their parents, relations and friends, with cries of distracted women and
            children who fill the streets — form a scene painful to humanity and im- possible to
            describe." To procure provisions, horses and wagons under the circumstances was indeed a
            herculean task. A few friendy Indians at the fort he with difficulty saved from the fury
            of the mob of rustics. Instead of helping him forward the settlers were rather a
            drawback and in- cumbrance, and had to be fed from the public crib. AND HIS CAMPAIGNS.
            33 THE MARCH TO BEDFORD. However, in i8 days after his arrival at Carlisle, by
            JLidicious and energetic measures, a convoy was procured and the army set out on its
            perilous march. His entire force did not exceed 500 men, of whom the most effective were
            the 42d Highlanders. Sixty of the 77th regiment were so weak that they had to be
            conveyed in wagons. They were intended for garrison duty at Bed- ford etc., while
            effective men at those forts were to join the army of deliverance. The bare-legged
            Highlanders with their kilts and plaids, and their infirm appearance, gave little
            assurance to the anxious people who watched their departure. The fate of Braddock a few
            years previous had not been forgotten, nor the desolation and despair that ensued.
            Nearly twice as many English troops had been slain on that fatal day as Bouquet had in
            his entire command, while the Indians that now infested the woods were far more numerous
            than those who routed the proudest of the Britons eight years previous. At Shippensburg,
            as at Carlisle, a great crowd of starving people were found, who had fled from the
            tomahawk and scalping knife. "On July 25, 1763 there were in Shippens- burg 1384 of our
            poor distressed back inhabitants, viz : 301 men, 345 women and 738 children, many of
            whom were obliged to lie in barns, stables, cellars and un- der old leaky sheds, the
            dwelling houses being all crowd- ed," says the chronicles of those days. In such a state
            of affairs it would seem that the provincial authorites and frontiers-men themselves
            would have united in one grand effort to drive out the savage destroyers of life and
            prop- erty. But Bouquet could get little or no aid from that quarter. A suicidal Quaker
            policy pervaded the civil authorities, while the settlers seemed benumbed with fear and
            despondancy. He writes to Amherst, "I find nnself utterly abandon- ed by the very people
            I am ordered to protect * * * I have borne very patiently the ill usage of this
            province, having still hopes that they will do something for us ; and 34 COL. HENRY
            BOUQUET therefore have avoided a quarrel with them." His efforts to engage a body of
            frontiersmen for the campaign were fruitless. They preferred to remain for the defence
            of their families, forgetting that their homes and families could never be secure until
            the savages had been driven back to their haunts beyond the Ohio and chastised into
            submission. Such a force of men, used to the woods and enured to pioneer life, would
            have been of vast service in the march. The Highlanders were sure to get lost in the
            woods when sent out as flankers. As Bouquet wrote to Amherst July 26, "I cannot send a
            Highlander out of my sight with- out running the risk of losing the man, which exposes
            me to surprises from the skulking villians I have to deal with." Doubtless, however, the
            tactics resorted to in 1758 to make his men effective against Indian attack and surprise
            during the Forbes campaign, were called into vigorous play during this march, as the
            outcome at Bushy Run clearly indicates. At Bedford, where he arrived July 25, Bouquet
            was more fortunate in enlisting frontiersmen and succeeded in getting about thirty to
            march with the army for flanking and scouting purposes. Murders had continued in the
            settlements, three men having been killed near Shippensburg by prowling sava- ges after
            the army passed. But thus far the troops had met with little molestation. THE MARCH TO
            LIGONIER. Now, however, began the real perils of the march, and greater caution was
            needed. Forests, rocks, ravines and thickets abounded on every side, inviting their wily
            foe to ambush the troops as they threaded their way through the valleys and across the
            mountains. But Bouquet knew exactly what the exigencies of the situation required. July
            28, the army started from Fort Bedford. A band of backwoodsmen led the way, followed
            closely by the pioneers ; the wagons and cattle were in the centre guarded by the
            regulars and a rear guard of backwoodsmen closed up the line. Frontier riflemen, or AND
            HIS CAMPAIGNS. 3 5 provincial rangers, scoured the woods on all sides, making surprise
            impossible. Bouquet himself, with musket in hand, oftentimes led the advance. Thus they
            toiled along the tedious way, which Burd, under Bouquet's orders, had opened through the
            wilderness five years before. The mountain air, the pure water an.d delightful scenery
            had an inspiriting effect upon the Highlanders, who grew stronger as they marched along.
            August 2, the little garrison and small body of pioneer settlers, who had held Fort
            Ligonier for two long months, were transported with the sight of the red coats of the
            Royal Americans and the kilts and plaids of the Highland- ers marching to their rescue.
            " The Campbells were coming " indeed, as the record of the bloody fight a few days later
            fully demonstrates. The clan Campbell, whose members have marched so oft in many lands
            to glory and the grave, was well repre- sented in the rank and file of Bouquet's army of
            deliver- ance. The Indians disappeared as the troops approached, but no tidings had been
            received from Fort Pitt for weeks. Bouquet wisely resolved to leave his wagons and oxen
            be- hind, which were the most cumbrous part of his convoy, in order to advance more
            rapidly and be in better shape to resist attack. Three hundred and forty pack horses
            were loaded with supplies foi: the needy garrison at Fort Pitt, and on the 4th day of
            August the army marched about a dozen miles and encamped for the night. Andrew Byerly
            and his son Michael accompanied the troops, in hopes of recovering some of their
            property, which had been left to the mercy of the Indians when the family had fled from
            Bushy Run over two months ago. After proceeding a few miles, the boy was sent back for
            some reason, to remain at Fort Ligonier. On his return he saw numerous Indian trails
            crossing the dusty road, over which the army had passed. The savages were on the alert
            to ascertain the number and character of the troops, and watching their opportunity to
            surprise and ambush them. Bouquet had his plans well arranged for the speedy $6 COL.
            HENR Y BOUQUET relief of Fort Pitt in a way that would be most likely to thwart the
            designs of the savages. His intention was to push on to Bushy Run, which would be an
            excellent place for man and beast to rest and recuperate for a few hours, and then set
            out and make a forced march by night through the defiles at Turtle Creek, where he
            expected the savages would try to ambuscade his troops. BUSHY RUN BATTLE. Accordingly,
            cm the morning of August 5, 1763, the troops set out at an early hour over the hills,
            and through the hollows of what now forms the heart of Westmoreland county, Pa. Along
            the Forbes road, shrouded on all sides by dense forests, they moved at a lively rate. By
            one o'clock the jaded column had advanced seventeen miles, and Andrew Byerly, along with
            a detachment of eighteen soldiers in the advance, cheered the weary troops with the
            welcome tidings that Bushy Run, their resting place, was only half a mile distant. All
            were pushing forward with renewed vigor, when suddenly the whole line was startled by
            the report of rifles in the front. A fierce assault had been made on the vanguard and
            the firing was quick and sharp. Twelve out of eighteen fell in the unequal con- flict
            that ensued before the two advance companies could press forward to the relief of their
            comrades. The firing became furious, indicating that the Indians were in large force and
            were fighting with unusual courage. The convoy of packhorses was halted, the troops were
            formed into line and a general bayonet charge was made through the forest. The yelping
            savages gave way before the cold steel of the Highlanders. But just as the route seemed'
            cleared in front, terrible war whoops resounded through the woods on either flank, and
            an uproar among the packhorse drivers indicated that the convoy was at- tacked in the
            rear. The troops in advance were instantly recalled to defend the convoy. Driving away
            the savages by repeated bayonet charges they formed a circle around the crowded and
            frantic horses. It was a new kind of work for the Highlanders, but they bore themselves
            with great AND HIS CAMPAIGNS. 37 steadiness and remarkable fortitude in spite of the
            terrific and confusing yells of their ferocious assailants and the deadly shots that
            came pouring in upon them from every thicket, tree or covert, large enough to conceal a
            foe. Noth- ing but implicit confidence in their commander and in the pluck and fidelity
            of each other could account for their undaunted gallantry under such trying
            circumstances. It seemed like pandemonium broke loose. Walter Scott has described such a
            scene : *' At once theie rose so wild a yell Within that dark and narrow dell, As all
            the fiends from heaven that fell, Had pealed the banner-cry of hell." Rushing up with
            terrific whoops, the painted demons would pour in a heavy fire, and when the Highlanders
            would charge bayonet they would dodge and vanish be- hind trees and thickets only to
            renew the assault the moment the troops returned toward the circle of defence. Many
            brave men fell on that hot afternoon. Captain Lieut. Graham and Lieut. Mcintosh of the
            42d High- landers were killed and Lieut. Graham wounded. Lieut. Donald Campbell of the
            77th was wounded and Lieut. Dow, of the Royal Americans, was shot through the body,
            after killing three Indians. Upwards of sixty men were killed or wounded in the action
            which lasted until dark. It was impossible to change position and the troops were
            obliged to lay upon their arms where they had stood during the fight. Numerous sentinels
            were posted to guard against a night attack. A space was made in the centre of the camp
            for the wounded, around whom a wall of flour bags was erected to protect them from the
            bullets which flew among them thick and fast from all side during the fight. It was
            indeed a sad and dreary night for the wounded. The agony of thirst was almost
            intolerable, springs ran out of the hill sides near by, but the savages guarded them
            well with their skirmish line, and it was almost cer- tain death to approach them. At
            imminent risk Byerly managed to convey a few hatfuls of water to the wounded
            Highlanders. A grateful shower of rain also afforded 38 COL. HENRY BOUQUET some relief.
            After Bouquet had made his dispositions for the night he proceeded to write a report of
            the battle to General Amherst, evidently supposing that he was not likely to survive the
            conflict the coming day. The re- port was written amid all the bustle of the camp when
            danger and death in their most horrid forms stared him in the face, and yet how
            carefully, calmly and correctly everything of note is stated ! Here it is. REPORT OF THE
            FIRST DAY's FIGHT NEAR BUSHY RUN. Camp at Edge Hill, 26 Miles from Fort Pitt, 5th Aug.
            1763. Sir : The second instant the troops and convoy arrived at Ligonier, where I could
            obtain no intelligence of the enemy. The expresses sent since the beginning of July,
            having been either killed or obliged to return, all the passes being occupied by the
            enemy. In this uncertainty, I determined to leave all the wagons, with the powder, and a
            quantity of stores and provisions, at Ligo- nier, and on the 4th proceeded with the
            troops and about 340 horses loaded with flour. I intended to have halted to-day at Bushy
            Run, ( a mile beyond this camp), and after having refreshed the men and horses, to have
            marched in the night over Turtle Creek, a very dangerous defile of several miles,
            commanded by high and rugged hills ; but at one o'clock this afternoon, after a march of
            17 miles, the sav- ages suddenly attacked our advance guard, which was immedi- ately
            supported by the two Light Infantry companies of the 42d regiment, who drove the enemy
            from their ambuscade and pur- sued them a good way. The savages returned to the attack,
            and the fire being obstinate on our front and extending along our flanks, we made a
            general charge with the whole line to dislodge the savages from the heights, in which
            attempt we succeded, without by it obtaining any decisive advantage, for as soon as they
            were driven from one post, they appeared on another, till, by continued reinforcements,
            they were at last able to surround us and attacked the convoy left in our rear ; this
            obliged us to march back to protect it. The action then became general, and though we
            were attacked on every side, and the savages exerted themselves with uncommon
            resolution, they were constantly re- pulsed with loss ; we also suffered considerably.
            Capt. Lieut. Graham and Lieut. James Mcintosh, of the 42d, are killed, and Capt. Graham
            wounded. Of the Royal American Regt., Lieut. Dow, who acted as A. D. Q. M. G., is shot
            through the body. AND HIS CAMPAIGNS. 39 Of the 77th, Lieut. Donald Campbell and Mr.
            Peebles, a volun- teer, are wounded. Our loss in men, including rangers and drivers,
            exceeds sixty killed or wounded. The action has lasted from one o'clock till night, and
            we expect to begin at daybreak. Whatever our fate may be, I thought it necessary to give
            your Excellency this early information, that you may at all events take such measures as
            you think proper with the Provinces, for their own safety, and the effectual relief of
            Fort Pitt, as in case of another engagement, I fear insurmountable difficulties in pro-
            tecting and transporting our provisions, being already so much weakened by the losses of
            this day in men and horses, besides the additional necessity of carrying the wounded,
            whose situation is truly deplorable. I cannot sufficiently acknowledge the constant
            assistance I have received from Major Campbell during this long action, nor express my
            admiration of the cool and steady behavior of the troops, who did not fire a shot
            without orders, and drove the enemy from their posts with fixed bayonets. The conduct of
            the officers is much above my praises. I have the honor to be with great respect, « Sir,
            etc. Henry Bouquet, To His Excellency, Sir Jeffrey Amherst. With gloomy forebodings the
            troops, and especially the wounded, awaited the dawn of the coming day. Wild whoops and
            occasional shots from the deep thickets and surrounding hillsides, indicated how eager
            the painted demons were to glut their vengeance. The hordes be- sieging Fort Pitt had
            all precipitated themselves upon Bouquet, knowing that if he and his supplies could be
            cut off and captured, the reduction of the fort would soon follow. It was a very
            disturbed and broken sleep that even the most securely sheltered of the troops could get
            at such a time. SECOND day's fight, AUGUST 6. With the first gray streaks of dawn came
            those inces- sant savage yells preluding a fierce assault on every side. Soon from every
            tree and bush that could conceal an enemy, a galling fire was poured upon the devoted
            forces of Bouquet. The Colonel himself, with his bright uniform. 40 COL. HENRY BOUQUET
            was a conspicuous mark, and the balls whizzed about him so thick that he concluded to
            change his dress. While doing so, behind a large tree, no less than fourteen bullets
            struck it. As on the previous day, the savages made fre- quent impetuous onsets in order
            to break through the line of defence. But they were firmly met and gallantly repulsed at
            every point. The gleam of the bayonets would cause them to retire swiftly to the bushes,
            but the moment the charge ceased they were back again with their demoniac yells, popping
            away at every exposed soldier. The long march and hard fight of the previous day, added
            to their burning thirst, " more intolerable than the ene- my's fire," as Bouquet puts
            it, left the troops in rather sorry plight to contend with such alert and daring assail-
            ants. The Indians had every advantage on their side in the way of shelter from the fire
            of the troops and being without any encumbrance they could attack and retreat with the
            greatest ease and rapidity. The savages marked the increasing fatigue and distress of
            the troops and, con- fident of speedy triumph, derided them in bad English and vulgar
            ribaldry. Keekyuskung, a Delaware chief, who had taken part in the murder of Colonel
            Clapham and his family, and who was a ringleader in getting up the conspiracy in
            general, was conspicuous in this kind of work throughout the morning, as he had been
            also on the previous night. His taunts were all the more provoking, as he bellowed them
            forth from behind a large tree, be- cause he had, in times past, received many favors
            from Colonel Bouquet and the Royal Americans, when on his visits to Fort Pitt. The
            interior of the camp was in great confusion owing to the fright of horses on account of
            the terriffic war whoops resounding on all sides and the hurts received from Indian
            bullets. The cowardly behaviour of the pack horse men added to the danger and tumult.
            They forsook the poor brutes and hid themselves in terror among the bushes, from which
            no command or entreaty could draw them to a discharge of duty. Breaking away from the
            convoy many of the horses dashed madly through the woods, and through the lines of the
            contending forces. The crisis was fearful and only a cool head, fertile in AND HIS
            CAMPAIGNS. 4 1 resources and a brave heart unappalled by any danger, could meet the
            emergency. The heat, the toil, the thirst, the increasing and more audacious assaults of
            the savages began to tell seriously upon the strength and spirits of the soldiers. They
            were growing weaker and falling rapidly while their relentless foes were every moment
            growing stronger and bolder. It was a crisis requiring the highest kind of military
            genius combined with indomitable resolution. Bouquet was equal to the ordeal and from
            the very jaws of defeat, disaster and death he snatched the most brilliant victory ever
            won over the Indians. A Captain or Lieutenant Barret, commanding it is said a small
            Maryland detachment of provincial rangers, point- ed out to Bouquet a place where a
            large body of the boldest of the Indians might be taken on the flank and rear by a well
            directed bayonet charge around the hill and up a hollow or ravine. Andrew Byerlywas with
            Bouquet at the time, and heard Barret make the suggestion, which the Colonel quickly put
            into execution on a large scale by a masterly piece of strategy. Immediately Major Camp-
            bell was directed to make a rapid circuit through the woods on the right flank of the
            savages around the hill afore- said, taking them in flank and rear. Captain Basset of
            the Royal Engineers was directed to arrange the other com- panies, so as to co-operate
            promptly with the strategic move- ment at the right moment. The thin line of troops that
            took the place of the two companies withdrawn from the front, gave away before the
            impetuous onset of the exultant savages and fell back upon the convoy, where they pre-
            sented a line of bristling steel. The Indians fell com- pletely into the snare and
            rushed with demoniac fury into the camp, certain that the fight was won. But just as
            they supposed themselves masters of the field the Highlanders charged in with a wild
            battle cry upon their right flank. A volley was fired upon the amazed and huddled
            savages, but they stood their ground with wonderful intrepidity, not willing to loose a
            decisive victory and the great booty of stores and scalps which a moment before they
            felt was within their grasp. It is 42 COL. HENRY BOUQUET agreed on all hands that on
            this occasion, not only in the attack and the assault, but in meeting the unexpected
            charge on their flank and rear, the Indians displayed un- usual courage and firmness.
            But a well directed bayonet charge no body of Indians ever did or will stand. Here
            Bouquet had them at last where he wanted them, at close quarters where there could be no
            dodging or popping from behind the trees. The Highlanders were at home with the bayonet
            and only too glad to get a good chance at the painted villains who had skulked behind
            trees while they shot their brave comrades during the past two days. Still the savages
            struggled in hope of gaining the day, but the shock was irresisti- ble and, perceiving
            that they had been caught in a trap, they fled in tumultuous disorder. In doing so they
            were obliged to pass in front of the companies brought up on the opposite side by Capt.
            Basset, from whom they received another volley. The four companies now vied with each
            other in driving the savages through the woods beyond Bushy Run without giving them time
            to reload their empty rifles. Many of their chief warriors were killed and the rest
            utterly routed. Among others, Kukyuskung, the ungrateful and blatant blackguard, and the
            famous war Chief called ''The Wolf," were slain. Amherst had expressed the hope that no
            prisoners with arms in their hands should be taken, and his wish was gratified.
            Historians say that in the fight only one In- dian was taken prisoner, and after a
            little examination he was shot down like a captured wolf. Hereby hangs a tale, which I
            was told by my great great grandfather, Jacob Byerly, and his son Joseph, on Christmas
            day 1855, two and a-half years before the old Revolutionary veteran passed away, at the
            age of 99 years. He had heard it often from his father, who was in the fight. When the
            flight of the savages had fairly begun, a Scotch Highland- er dropped his musket and
            darted after the fugitives, as only a fleet-footed Highlander could. Soon he overtook
            and mastered, single-handed, one of the largest of the sav- ages, whom he was leading
            toward the camp, when he was met by an officer of Barret's detachment. '' What are you
            AND HIS CAMPAIGNS. 43 going to do with that fellow ? " said the fussy official. " I am
            taking him to Colonel Bouquet. If you want one, there are plenty of them running yonder
            in the woods, and you may catch one for yourself," replied the Highlan- der. The officer
            drew his pistol and shot the prisoner through the head, which cowardly deed greatly
            incensed the brave Highlander and called forth the indignant re- buke of Bouquet, when
            informed of the affair. Sixty dead Indians were found on the field, and many wounded had
            been conveyed away by their friends. Bou- quet had won a decisive but dearly bought
            victory. Eight officers were killed or severely wounded, and in all one hundred and
            fifteen men, or nearly one-fourth of the entire force had been killed, wounded or were
            missing, as a result of the two day's conflict. The pack horse drivers emerged from the
            bushes, and, in company with some of the Rangers, proceeded to scalp the dead Indians,
            whom the regular troops disdained to touch. So many of the horses had escaped through
            their neg- lect and cowardice during the conflict that a large quan- tity^ of valuable
            stores had to be destroyed for lack of transportation to prevent them from falling into
            the hands of the Indians after the army passed on. Litters were made and the wounded
            were borne to Bushy Run, where the army encamped to rest and refresh themselves after
            the exhausting struggle of the past two days. After the severe handling they had lately
            received it was supposed the Indians would not molest them soon again. But scarcely had
            they gone into camp before a volley was fired into their midst. The angered Highlanders
            scon dis- persed the prowling miscreants without awaiting orders to do so. Ten of the
            wounded died at Bushy Run and were buried next day where Harrison city now stands. The
            Indians returned to the battle-field after night and scalped all the dead they could
            find. These gory trophies they shook at the garrison and raised the scalp haloo, as they
            marched past Fort Pitt in a body, a short time before the army appeared on the morning
            of Aug. lo. As on the night before. Bouquet rested not until he had 44 COL. HENRY
            BOUQUET written his report of the day's conflict, which was done in such a complete
            manner that he never had occasion to change or supplement it. Through the courtesy of
            her Majesty's government I have been furnished with an authentic copy of Bouquet's
            reports of these conflicts. The official reports are in all respects the same as given
            by Parkman, except the indi- cated omission by the copyist of the scalping operations of
            the Rangers and packhorse drivers, which I have sup- plied from Parkman's full text. But
            the detailed tabular statement of killed, wounded and missing in the Bushy Run battles I
            have never seen published elswhere, not even by Parkman. It is very important and
            interesting, showing the relative losses of the Highlanders, Royal Americans and
            Rangers. The first named formed nearly two-thirds of Bouquet's force, and besides having
            to do the heavy work, making repeated bayonet charges, they were not used to the
            Indian's mode of fighting as were the small detachments of Rangers and Royal Americans.
            Hence the loss of the gallant Scotch far exceeds that of all other parties combined. The
            42d Regiment of Royal Highlanders bore the brunt of the fierce assaults in front in the
            first days' battle and has a proud record on the roll of honor. bouquets' report of
            second day's fight. Camp at Bushy Run, 6th Aug. 1763. Sir : I had the honor to inform
            your Excellency in my letter of yesterday of our first engagement with the savages. We
            took the post last night on the hill where our convoy halted, when the front was
            attacked, (a commodious piece of ground and just spacious enough for our purpose). There
            we encircled the whole and covered our wounded with flour bags. In the morning the
            savages surrounded our camp, at the dis- tance of 500 yards, and by shouting and
            yelping, quite round that extensive circumference, thought to have terrified us with
            their numbers. They attacked us early, and under favor of an incessant fire, made
            several bold efforts to penetrate our camp, and though they failed in the attempt, our
            situation was not the less perplexing, having experienced that brisk attacks had little
            effect upon an enemy who always gave way when pressed, and AND HIS CAMPAIGNS. 45
            appeared again immediately. Our troops were, besides, extremely fatigued with the long
            march and as long action of the preceding day, and distressed to the last degree, by a
            total want ot water, much more intolerable than the enemy's fire. Tied to our convoy, we
            could not lose sight of it without ex- posing it and our wounded to fall a prey to the
            savages, who pressed upon us, on every side, and to move it was impracticable, having
            lost many horses, and most of the drivers, stupified by fear, hid themselves in the
            bushes, or were incapable of hearing or obeying orders. The savages growing every moment
            more audacious, it was thought proper to still increase their confidence by that means,
            if possible, to entice them to come close upon us, or to stand their ground when
            attacked. With this view two companies of Light Infantry where ordered within the
            circle, and the troops on their right and left opened their files and filled up the
            space, that it might seem they were intended to cover the retreat. The Third Light
            Infantry company and the Grenadiers of the 42d were ordered to support the two first
            companies. This manoeuvre succeeded to our wish, for the few troops who took possession
            of the ground lately occupied by the two Light Infantry companies being brought in
            nearer to the centre of the circle, the barbarians mistaking these motions for a
            retreat, hur- ried headlong on, and advancing upon us, with the most daring intrepidity,
            galled us excessively with their heavy fire; but at the very moment that they felt
            certain of success, and thought themselves masters of the camp. Major Campbell, at the
            head of the first companies, sallied out from a part of the hill they could not observe,
            and fell upon their right flank. They reso- lutely returned the fire, but could not
            stand the irresistible shock of our men, who, rushing in among them, killed many of them
            and put the rest to flight. The orders sent to the other two companies were delivered so
            timely by Captain Basset, and exe- cuted with such celerity and spirit, that the routed
            savages who happened that moment to run before their front, received their full fire,
            when uncovered by the trees. The four companies did not give them time to load a second
            time, nor even to look be- hind them, but pursued them till they were totally dispersed.
            The left of the savages, which had not been attacked, were kept in awe by the remains of
            our troops, posted on the brow of the hill for that purpose ; nor durst they attempt to
            support or assist their right, but being witness to their defeat, followed their exam-
            ple and fled. Our brave men disdained so much as to touch the dead body of a vanquished
            enemy that scarce a scalp was taken except by the Rangers and pack-horse drivers. The
            woods being now cleared and the pursuit over, the four 46 COL. HENRY BOUQUET companies
            took possession of a hill in our front, and as soon as litters could be made for the
            wounded, and the flour and every- thing destroyed, which, for want of horses, could not
            be carried, we marched without molestation to this camp. After the severe correction we
            had given the savages a few hours before, it was natural to suppose we should enjoy some
            rest, but we had hardly fixed our camp, when they fired upon us again. This was very
            provoking ; however, the Light Infantry dispersed them before they could receive orders
            for that purpose. I hope we shall be no more disturbed, for, if we have another action,
            we shall hardly be able to carry our wounded. The behavior of the troops on this
            occasion, speaks for itself so strongly, that for me to attempt their eulogium would but
            de- tract from their merit. I have the honor to be, most respectfully, Sir, etc. Henry
            Bouquet, To His Excellency, Sir Jefferey Amherst. P. S. — I have the honor to enclose
            the return of the killed, wounded and missing in the two engagements. H. B. AND HIS
            CAMPAIGNS. 48 COL. HENR Y BOUQUET ( Colonial Correspondence — Americari and West Indies
            — Sir Jeff. Amherst, 1763, Vol. 97.) New York, 3d Sept., 1763. My Lord : — On the loth
            of last month Col. Bouquet got his convoy into Fort Pitt, after having been attacked on
            the 5 th and 6th by a very numerous body of savages, which he repulsed and defeated,
            though not without some loss on our side. Captain Lieut. Graham and Lieut. James
            Mcintosh, of the 42d, being killed, with an officer of Rangers, and four officers
            wounded — in the whole, 49 were killed and 60 wounded. As I have the honor to transmit
            to your Lordship Colonel Bouquet's letter with my answers, and the account I made public
            here of that affair, I need not repeat the praises due to the troops for their behavior,
            clogged as they were by a large but necessary convoy, and on a very un- toward
            communication. *********** * I have honor to be with the utmost respect, my Lord, your
            Lordship's most humble and obedient servant, JEFFERY Amherst. Right Honorable Earl of
            Egremont. The copies of Col. Henry Bouquet's official reports of the battles with the
            Indians, near Bushy Run, I have received direct from the British government, in re-
            sponse to a letter written last January, which was en- dorsed by Hon. Wm. S. Stenger,
            Secretary of Common- wealth ; Hon. H. P. Laird, Gen. R. C. Drum, Secretary of War
            Lincoln, and transmitted officially by Secretary of State Frelinghuysen. The reports of
            Bouquet, written in the midst of such exciting and confusing scenes are models of
            exactness and reflect high honor upon him as a soldier and a scholar. Although a Swiss
            and well acquainted with German, French and other European languages, he wrote English
            better than the great majority of English officers. With the aid of these reports and
            Hutchins' map, drawn up a few years after the battle, it is easy to locate the field of
            conflict. The first day's fight, where the 42d Highland regiment suffered so severely,
            took place on the Gonaware Hills, near Harrison City, located on Bushy Run. The fight
            around the convoy, where the savages were finally am- bushed and routed, took place on
            the Wanamaker farm, a AND^HIS CAMPAIGNS. 49 short distance south-east of Mr. W.'s
            present residence. The old Forbes road ran through the Wanamaker and Gongaware farms,
            along a different line from the present road, but that line is well known by Mr. W,, and
            others, who cleared away the native woods on both sides of the Forbes road. By comparing
            the march and resources of Bouquet with those of other Indian fighters, we are filled
            with increasing admiration at his success, August 5 and 6, 1763, on the bloody fields
            near Bushy Run. With a force of less than 500 men, mostly composed of raw Highlanders,
            unused to Indian warfare. Bouquet de- fended his convoy of 340 pack-horses and finally
            routed the horde of savages who had fought with unusual cou- rage and sagacity. True, he
            lost about one-fourth of his men in killed and wounded, but an equal or greater loss was
            inflicted on his wily and savage foes. Compare this with the results of similar
            conflicts. Braddock, in 1755, with 1,400 men, lost nearly 900, and out of 85 officers,
            64 were killed or wounded. And yet he was opposed by only a few hundred Indians and
            French, who lost only 30, all told, of their number. As a consequence, the borders were
            desolated for hundreds of miles and thousands of pioneers were driven from their homes
            or massacred. Col. Crawford, with 500 men, in 1782, was routed, and himself, his son and
            son-in-law captured and burned at the stake. Col. Loughrey, with 140 picked frontiersmen
            from West- moreland, was surprised and all his force captured by an Indian detachment in
            1781. Gen. Harmer, 1790, with 300 regulars and over 1,000 volunteers was routed with a
            loss of several hundred of his best troops. Gen. St. Clair, a brave and able officer,
            1791, with 1,200 men, in line of battle, expecting attack and provided with artillery,
            and with large reinforcements near at hand, met with overwhelming defeat, and a loss of
            68 officers killed 28 wounded, together with over half of his men. And these were for
            the most part veterans, used to fighting and commanded by gallant and experienced
            officers. In the light of these and many similar conflicts in the c 50 COL. HENRY
            BOUQUET olden times or in recent years, the valor and ability of Bouquet shine forth in
            replendent colors. Or take a suc- cessful Indian fighter like Gen. Anthony Wayne and we
            find that Bouquet stands the peer of the greatest. Gen. Wayne had over 1,500 veteran and
            mounted Kentuckians and 2,000 regulars, including artillery in 1794. After sharp
            fighting, he routed about half his number of In-, dians, with a loss of -^-^ killed and
            a hundred of his own men wounded. The loss of the Indians was about the same as that of
            the whites. Under Braddock's mangement the Indians killed fifty white to every one of
            their own number slain, while under Bouquet's management they lost more of their own
            warriors than they were able to destroy of the whites. It is to honor the memory and
            perpetuate the hero- ism of this superb man and his gallant army of deliverance that
            Westmorelanders and all patriotic citizens of West Pennsylvania, Virginia and Ohio are
            invited to assemble on the historic field of his grandest triumph, Aug. 6, 1883. " The
            battle of Bushy Run," says Parkman the great historian of Colonial timee, " was one of
            the best contest- ed actions ever fought between white men and Indians. * * * The
            Indians displayed throughout a fierceness and intrepidity matched only by the steady
            valor with which they were met. In the provinces the victory excited equal joy and
            admiration, especially among those who knew the incalculable difficulties of an Indian
            cam- paign. The Assembly of Pennsylvania passed a vote ex- pressing their sense of the
            merits of Bouquet and of the services he had rendered to the province. He soon after
            received the additional honor of the formal thanks of the King." The army in a few days
            reached Fort Pitt, to the great joy and relief of the garrison, whose stock of
            provisions were about exhausted. Bouquet wrote, as follows : To Sir Jeffery Amhurst :
            Fort Pitt, Aug. 11. 1763. Sir : — We arrived here yesterday without further opposition
            than scattered shots along the road. The Delawares, Shawanese, Wiandots and Mingoes, had
            closely beset and attacked this fort from the 27th July to the ist inst., when they
            quitted it to march against us. AND HIS CAMPAIGNS. 5 1 The boldness of those savages is
            hardly credible ; they had taken post under the banks of both rivers close to the fort,
            where digging holes, they kept an incessant fire, and threw fire arrows. They are good
            marksmen, and though our people were . under cover, they killed one and wounded seven.
            Captain Ecuyer is wounded in the leg by an arrow. I should not do justice to that
            officer should I omit mentioning, that without engineer or any other artificers than a
            few shipwrights, he has raised a parapet of logs round the fort above the old one
            (which, having not been finished was too low and enfiladed) palisaded the inside of the
            area, constructed a fire engine, and, in short, has taken all pre- cautions, which art
            and judgment could suggest, for the preserva- tion of this post, open before on three
            sides, which had suffered by the floods. The inhabitants have acted with spirit against
            the enemy, and in the repairs of the fort. Captain Ecuyer expresses an entire
            satisfaction in their conduct. The artillery and the small number of regulars have done
            their duty with distinction. Sir Jeffery Amherst's letters add to the above accounts,
            that by his last intelligence the number of savages in the two actions of the 5th and
            6th of August slain, was about sixty, and a great many wounded in the pursuit. That the
            three principle ring- leaders of those people, who had the greatest share in fomenting
            the present troubles and were concerned in the murder of Col. Clapham, etc., viz:
            Kikyuscuting, and the Wolf and Butler, were, according to the information sent him,
            killed ; the two former in the field, and the last at Fort Pitt. THE OWNERSHIP OF THE
            BUSHY RUN TRACT. It has been asserted by some writers, in recent as well as colonial
            days, that Col. Ephraim Blaine was in com- mand of Fort Ligonier, which he bravely
            defended with provincial troops until Bouquet came along, after which he accompanied the
            army as commander of the pack-horse brigade, and took an active part in the battle of
            Bushy Run, where he came near losing his life, etc. He then re- solved that some day he
            would become the owner of that historic field. All this is pure fiction, evidently
            gotten up for a special purpose, in order to invalidate the claims of the Byerlys to the
            grant on Bushy Run, originally given by Col. Bou- quet and secured by settlement and
            valuable improve- ments. 52 COL, HENRY BOUQUET The name and record of Lieut. Archibald
            Blane, ( not Blaine ), who defended Fort Ligonier with a detachment of Royal Americans
            in 1763, have been confounded with those of Col. Ephraim Blaine, who first appears as a
            com- missary sergeant in Bouquet's campaign of 1764, Neither Lieutenant A. Blane nor
            Colonel E. Blaine was in the Bushy Run battle. The former wrote Bouquet a letter from
            Fort Ligonier, immediately after the battle, congratu- lating him on his recent victory
            at Bushy Run. See Park- man's Pontiac, Vol. IL, p. 160. See also page 407, of Washington
            — Irvine correspondence — where Ephraim Blaine's record is correctly sketched. The truth
            is Ephraim Blaine jumped the older and origi- nal Byerly claim by a patent, confirmed by
            the Pennsylva- nia Executive Council in the distracted days of 1786, long after the
            death of the elder Byerly, and when his widow and children were in no shape to dispute
            his unjust usur- pation. For forty-one pounds of provincial currency, when that currency
            was comparatively worthless, he man- aged to get a technical title to the old Byerly
            tract of over 300 acres along the Forbes road, on the historic field of Bushy Run ! This
            was bad enough surely, but to make him one of the chief heroes in the fight, to boost up
            the unjust claim, is to violate not only the rights of a family but the rights of
            humanity. It pollutes the fountains and muddies the sacred stream of history itself. It
            was no great credit to be in command of the pack- horse brigade at the Bushy Run battle,
            as Col. Bouquet's report indicates. And we do Col. Blaine's memory a ser- vice by
            relieving him from the equivocal position in which certain prominent individuals placed
            him in the suit for ownership of the battle-field, when they testified that Col. Blaine
            took part in the battle of 1763 as commander of the pack-horse brigade, et:c. Hon. Jos.
            H. Kuhns, who was counsel for the Blaines in the later stages of the suit, ( when
            Blaine's friends claimed that he had bought Byerly 's right and title) told the writer a
            few weeks ago that the general feeling at the time of the trial was that the Byerlys had
            right and jus- tice on their side. The presiding judge, being a resident AND HIS
            CAMPAIGNS. 53 of Carlisle and a special friend of the Blaines, was blamed with
            partiality. Until recently Mr. Kuhns believed the fiction about the presence and narrow
            escape of Col. Ephraim Blaine in the battle, etc., which had been palmed off in the
            courts, etc., at the trial. But after learning the real facts in the case, and seeing how
            the names and records of Lieut. Archibald Blane and Col. Ephraim Blaine had been
            confounded, he wrote me the following candid note on the subject : Greensburg, Pa., May
            2, 1883. Rev. Cyrus Cort : Rev. and Dear Sir. — Your esteemed favor received. I am
            satisfied that the story of Blaine's claim to the battle ground is apocryphal. He was an
            intruder upon Byerly, who was, in point of fact, the first actual owner of the ground by
            occupancy and legal authority of the proprietary government of Penn'a. Respectfully,
            JOS. H. KUHNS. So much for the question of original and rightful owner- ship of Bushy
            Run battlefield. Byerly removed his family to Fort Bedtord, by advice of Bouquet, until
            peace was firmly established at the end of next year. He then re- turned and occupied
            the grant on Bushy Run. About the time of the breaking out of the Revolutionary war, he
            took his son Andrew to Lancaster, Pa., to give him a chance to get an education at the
            'home of his step-sisters. While on this visit the old gentleman died, and was buried at
            Strasburg, in that county. I am indebted to Ad. J. Eberly, esq., and Rev. J. A. Peters
            for the following facts, which should have been stated at page 17 : Record book B, page
            349, contains a deed from James Hamilton, esq., to Andreas Byerly, for a lot of ground
            on east side of North Queen street, a frontage of 64 feet and 4^ inches and a depth of
            245 feet, in the town of Lancas- ter, Pa., dated October 25, 1745. The baptismal records
            of the First Reformed church of Lancaster, Pa., mention Andreas Byerly as standing spon-
            sor for a child, Feb. 3, 1745. So also on May 3, 1750, he and his wife served in same
            capacity for a child by name of Houck, from Strasburg Twp., and again for a Backen- 54
            COL. HENRY BOUQUET stopp, Feb. 4, 1753, under the pastorates of Revs. Schnorr- bock and
            Otterbein, respectively. The Byerly family resided for greater safety at Fort Walthour
            during the Revolution. Jacob served in several campaigns against the Indians, and killed
            a chief in a fight near Brady's Bend, when quite a young man. Mrs. Byerly was a very
            intelligent, humane and pious woman. She had been well trained in the doctrines of the
            Reformed Church of Switzerland. She did good ser- vice as a nurse and a kind of
            doctoress during those dark and dangerous days. But her care was extended to the soul as
            well as body. She established a Sunday school for the intellectual and religious
            training of the neglected children at the fort, and in various ways was a public
            benefactress. Some years after Mr. Byerly's death she was married to a Mr. Lord, an
            Englishman. She lies buried among her children at the old Brush Creek grave- yard.
            Andrew Byerly had four sons, viz. : Michael, Jacob, Francis and Andrew. Their
            descendants are scat- tered over a great part of the United States. Jacob en- tered the
            Revolutionary army at sixteen, and saw hard service for several years in helping to
            guard the frontiers against Indians and Tories. His son Andrew was major in the War of
            1812, and guarded the ships of Commodoie Perry's fleet, while being built on Lake Erie.
            Benjamin was a lieutenant and Joseph a private, as also his son-in- law, Skelly, in the
            same war. Benjamin was likewise sheriff and assemblyman. Captain George A. Cribbs, who
            fell at the head of his men at the second battle of Manassas, was married to a grand
            daughter of Jacob Byerly, and Sergeant Cyrus Rankin, who fell on the Peninsula, was a
            great grandson. Mrs. James Gregg, of Greensburg, is a granddaughter of Michael, and
            Daniel C. Byerly, deceased, was a grand- son. Prof. Andrew Byerly, of Millersville
            Normal School, is a grandson of Andrew II. The descendants of Francis Byerly are
            numerous in Iowa. Michael, Jacob and Francis married three sisters named Harmon, whose
            mother was Christina Lenhart, from Holland. Jacob was married in old Fort Walthour, AND

            buried with fine military monuments at Brush Creek graveyard. EVIL RESULTS OF PROVINCIAL
            APATHY. After their discomfiture at Bushy Run, the Indians moved from their towns along
            the Alleghany and Ohio rivers into the Muskingum country, where they fancied themselves
            entirely safe from molestation, while at the same time they could carry on their
            depredations by sud- den incursions into the white settlements. It would have been wise
            policy and an immense saving of life and treas- ure had they been followed at once to
            their forest fast- nesses and brought to terms by a display of military prowess in their
            own haunts. This was exactly what Bouquet proposed to do. As soon as he had brought his
            heavy convoy through from Fort Ligonier to Port Pitt, he made strenuous efforts to
            secure reinforcements for such an expedition into the heart of the Indian country.
            August 27, 1763, he wrote General Amherst from Fort Pitt that with a re-inforcement of
            three hundred Provincal Rangers he could destroy all the Delaware towns " and clear the
            country of that vermin between this fort and Lake Erie." He bitterly complained that the
            provinces would not even furnish escorts to convoys, so that his hands were completely
            tied, He candidly admitted the importance and value of provincials for service against
            the savages in the woods, something which Amherst, like Braddock before him, was loth to
            do. October 24, 1763, he writes the haughty and obstinate Amherst as follows : " Without
            a certain number of woodsmen I cannot think it advisable to employ regulars in the woods
            against savages, as they cannot procure any intelligence and are open to continual
            surprises, nor can they pursue to any distance their enemy when they have routed them ;
            and should they have the misfortune to be defeated, the whole would be destroyed, if
            above one day's march from a fort. That is my opinion, in which I hope to be deceived."
            5" COL. HENRY BOUQUET The Quaker Provincial authorities, backed by the Dun- kard and
            Mennonite elements among the Germans, seemed to be utterly insensible to the dangers and
            sufferings of the exposed settlements near the borders. In their more secure abodes in
            the older settlements they would prate about the wickedness of wa;r, and try to justify
            their im- practicable theories by extensive scriptural quotations. St. Paul teaches that
            civil government is a divine insti- tution, and its representatives must not bear the
            sword in vain, but be a terror to evil-doers and a praise to them that do well. See
            Rom., 13. All this was ignored, and in place of it was substituted a perverted theory of
            non-resistance. The exhortations to individual Christians to forego the gratification of
            pri- vate or personal revenge, on the ground of the old law of retaliation, was applied
            to civil rulers and governments in a way that was contrary to reason and Scripture. The
            Great Cove, in Blair county, was settled by Dunk- ards as early as 1755. These were
            exposed to Indian raids. " Gottes unlle set getha?i,'' they would say, while the brutal
            savages were tomahawking their wives and children, in whose defence they would not lift
            a finger. They seemed to think that it was the Lord's will that the devil and his agents
            should have full swing without opposition. The strong and vigorous Scotch Presbyterian
            and the German Reformed and Lutheran elements of the popula- tion had no patience or
            sympathy with such sentimental views. When their families or friends were being ruth-
            lessly slaughtered by the savages, they were filled with indignation against all who
            either directly or indirectly abetted the cruel destroyers of life and property. Large
            numbers of Reformed and Lutheran families had settled along the Codorus, the Conewago,
            the Monocacy and Connocheague streams of Pennsylvania and Maryland, where regularly
            organized congregations existed already in 1748, as we learn from the " Life and Travels
            of Rev. Michael Schlatter." So also at Winchester and other points through the
            Shenandoah Valley. The Royal American Regiment, as we have seen, was largely composed of
            this element and commanded by ex- AND HIS CAMPAIGNS. 57 perienced German and Swiss
            officers, who had seen service in the armies of the Dutch Republic. The horrors of
            savage warfare fell upon these settle- ments and soldiers, together with their
            Scotch-Irish neigh- bors, in the Conococheague settlements. The friendly Conestoga
            Indians in Lancaster county and the Moravian Indian converts along the Lehigh were
            blamed for harboring and abetting some of the marauding Indians, and the full force of
            popular fury was arrayed against them. When homes were being daily deso- lated, parents
            tomahawked and scalped, and children carried into heathen captivity, it was natural for
            the people to hate the name of Indian and to be filled with wrath at any one who would
            protect or counte- nance any member of the race. The supineness of the Provincial
            Assembly, and their failure to second the efforts of such a man as Bouquet was
            discouraging and demoralizing and provoking in the extreme to the regular troops, who
            had suffered so much oh the outposts, and to the hardy pioneers in the advanced
            settlements. The Paxton Boys, in their riotous conduct at the Lancaster jail and in
            their march to Philadelphia, helped to awaken the Quakers from their dream of lethargic
            indifference. The Royal Americans had been kept in the woods for over six years, and now
            Amherst sought to compel regulars to remain in service after the long term of enlistment
            had expired. These causes combined to produce great discon- tent, both among officers
            and men. They were expected to hold many important posts and keep up long lines of
            communication in the midst of the wilderness, surrounded by prowling and hostile
            savages. Lieut. Archibald Blane and the gallant Capt. Ecuyer asked Bouquet to be
            relieved from labors and responsiblilities too heavy for their strength and resources.
            And Bouquet himself chagrined, at some action of the British government which seemed to
            shut the door of promotion against foreign born officers, and worried out of patience by
            the ingratitude and neglect of the provinces, felt himself constrained to do the same
            thing. 5 8 COL. HENRY BOUQUET Amherst had left for England, disgusted with the situa-
            tion and angry at the provinces for want of co-operation. General Gage had taken his
            place as commander-in-chief. Bouquet wrote Gage, June 20, 1764, asking to be relieved of
            the command, the burden and fatigues of which were too great for his strength to endure
            much longer. He thus refers to the condition of the troops at the same time: " The three
            companies of Royal Americans were reduced, when I met them at Lancaster, to 55 men,
            having lost -^^ by desertion, in my short absence. I look upon Sir Jeffery Amherst's
            orders forbidding me to con- tinue to discharge, as usual, the men whose term of service
            was expired, and keeping us seven years in the woods, as the occasion of this
            unprecedented desertion. The en- couragement given everywhere in this country to
            deserters, screened almost by every person, must in time ruin the army unless the laws
            against harbourers are better en- forced by the American (provincial) government." But
            Gage would not consent to relieve so useful a man in such an emergency. It was agreed
            that two strong bodies of troops should proceed into the Indian country to do what
            Bouquet was anxious to do the previous sum- mer, i. e. chastise the savages into
            submission in their own native strongholds. Bradstreet was to take a large force by way
            of the Lakes and co-operate with Bouquet, who was to march with his Bushy Run veterans
            (what was left of them) and a large force of provincial rangers to be raised in
            Pennsyslvania, Virginia and Maryland. The Pennsylvania Assembly voted to raise three
            hun- dred men to guard the frontiers and one thousand to join Bouquet's expedition into
            Ohio. Virginia and Maryland at first refused to do anything for the common defence.
            MASSACRE OF A SCHOOL-MASTER AND TEN SCHOLARS. The summer of 1764 was rapidly passing
            away, and nothing effective had yet been done. The Indians con- tinued their ravages and
            penetrated deeper and deeper into the settlements, killing and slaying the defenceless
            people. AND HIS CAMPAIGNS. 59 "In 1764, July 26, three miles northwest of Greencastle,
            Frankhn county, Pa. , was perpetrated what Parkraan, the great historian of Colonial
            times, pronounces ' an outrage unmatched in fiend-like atrocity through all the annals
            of the war.' This was the massacre of Enoch Brown, a kind-hearted exemplary Christian
            schoolmaster, and ten scholars, eight boys and two girls. Ruth Hart and Ruth Hale were
            the names of the girls. Among the boys were Eben Taylor, George Dustan and Archie
            McCullough. All were knocked down like so many beeves and scalped by the merciless
            savages. Mourning and desolation came to many homes in the valley, for each of the
            slaughtered inno- cents belonged to a different family. The last named boy, in- deed,
            survived the effects of the scalping knife, but in a some- what demented condition. The
            teacher offered his life and scalp in a spirit of self-sacrifiic- ing devotion if the
            savages would only spare the lives of the little ones under his charge and care. But no
            ! the tender mercies of the heathen are cruel, and so a perfect holocaust was made to
            the Moloch of war by the relentless fiends in human form. The school house was located
            on the farm now occupied by Mr. Henry Diehl, and formerly owned by Mr. Christian Koser.
            It stood in a cleared field, at the head of a deep ravine, surrounded by dense forests.
            Down this ravine the savages fled a mile or two until they struck Conococheague creek,
            along the bed of which, to con- ceal their tracks, they traveled to the mouth of Path
            Valley, up which and across the mountains they made good their escape to their village,
            near the Ohio. It is some relief to know that this diabolical deed, whose re- cital
            makes us shudder even at this late date, was disapproved by the old warriors when the
            marauding party of young Indians came back with their horrid trophies. Neephaughwhese,
            or Night Walker, an old chief or half-king, denounced them as a pack of cowards for
            killing and scalping so many children. But who can describe the agony of those parents
            in the Cono- cocheague, settlement weeping like Rachel for her children and refusing to
            be comforted ? Or who can describe the horror of the scene in that lonely log school
            house, when one of the settlers chanced to look in at the door to ascertain the cause of
            the un- usual quietness. In the centre lay the faithful Brown, scalped and lifeless,
            with a Bible clasped in his hand. Around the room were strewn the dead and mangled
            bodies of seven boys and two girls, while little Archie, stunned, scalped and bleeding,
            was creeping around among his dead companions, rubbing his hands over their faces and
            trying to gain some token of recognition. 6o COL. HENRY BOUQUET A few days later the
            innocent victims of savage atrocity re- ceived a common sepulture. All were buried in
            one large, rough box at the border of the ravine, a few rods from the school house where
            they had been so ruthlessly slaughtered. Side by side, with head and feet alternately,
            the little ones were laid with their master, just as they were clad at the time of the
            massacre. Strange to say, no memorial tablet has ever been erected over their remains.
            Tradition has preserved the exact location of the common grave of master and scholars,
            and it is not too late yet for grateful, patriotic and philanthropic Christian people,
            enjoy- ing the blessings of civilization, peace and prosperity, to render this duty of
            the living to the martyred dead. August 4, 1843, or seventy-nine years after the
            slaughter, a number of the principal citizens of Greencastle made excava- tions to
            verify the traditional account of the place and manner of burial. Some remains of the
            rough coffin were found at quite a depth from the surface, and then the skull and other
            remains of a grown person, alongside of which were remains of several children. Metal
            buttons, part of a tobacco-box, teeth, etc., were picked up as relics by those present,
            among whom were some of our citizens still living with us in a green old age, viz : Dr.
            Wm. Grubb, Dr. J. K. Davison, Geo. W. Zeigler, Esq., and Gen. David Detrich. There was a
            good deal of talk at the time about the propriety of buying the adjacent grounds, laying
            out a road and erecting a monument; but nothing definite was ever done. Mr. Koser, the
            owner of the farm, took a lively interest in the matter, and in lieu of a better
            memorial planted four locust trees to mark the corners of the grave. Two of these only
            survived and are men- tioned by S. H. Eby, Esq., Sup't of Common Schools, in his
            interesting report, published 1877. But, alas ! even these im- perfect historic
            landmarks were cut down a few years ago for the sake of making a few posts, and Mr.
            Koser's well-meant ef- forts to preserve the identity of the grave have thus in a meas-
            ure been thwarted. The stumps remain as frail indices by which the exact location of the
            grave may still be accurately determined. Such is the present state of the case as
            ascertained last Wed- nesday (April II, 1883), on a visit to the spot by Gen. David
            Detrich, Col. B. F. Winger and Rev. Cyrus Cort." The foregoing is an extract from an
            article that ap- peared in the Greencastle Press. 1 am glad to be able to report that as

            Lieut. Colonels Francis and Clayton were assembled at Carlisle. Gov. Penn had come up
            from Philadelphia with Col. Bouquet and addressed the troops. He spoke of the necessity
            of chastising the Indians " for their re- peated and unprovoked barbarities on the
            inhabitants of the Province, a just resentment of which added to a re- membrance of the
            loyalty and courage of our provincial troops on former occasions he did not doubt, would
            ani- mate them to do honour to their country, and that they could not but hope to be
            crowned with success as they were to be united with the same regular troops and under
            the same able commander who had by themselves on that very day, the memorable 5th of
            August, in the preceeding year, sustained the repeated attacks of the savages and
            obtained a complete victory over them." Gov. Penn also' reminded them of the exemplary
            pun- ishments that would be inflicted on the grevious crime of desertion, if any of them
            were capable of so far forgetting their solemn oath and duty to their king and country
            as to be involved in it. Col. Bouquet then took command of the troops, regular and
            provincial. After four days of neces- sary preparation for the long march, the army set
            out. Col. Bouquet gave very strict " orders to officers and men to observe strict
            discipline and not to commit the least violation of the civil rights or peace of the
            inhabi- tants." His care and conduct in this respect stand forth in happy contrast with
            that of many militia or emergency men who came up the valley to defend the borders from
            invasion a hundred years later, but who in the end were more harmful and more dreaded by
            the loyal people of the borders than the disciplined host of Southern invaders under
            Lee. 62 COL. HENRY BOUQUET DESERTIONS OF PROVINCIAL TROOPS. In spite of all precautions,
            no less than 200 desertions took place by August 13, when the army reached Fort Londoun.
            Bouquet asked permission to fill up the contingent, which was granted by resolution of
            the governor and com- missioners August 16. He then applied to Colonel Lewis for 200
            Virginia volunteers, to take the place of the de- serters. With the co-operation of
            Governor Fauquier the men were soon raised and joined Bouquet at Fort Pitt in the latter
            part of September. These Virginia volunteer riflemen were among his best troops, but in
            the end, Virginia ungratefully left Col. Bouquet in the lurch as regards their payment.
            At Fort Loudoun, Bouquet received a very presumptu- ous and characteristic letter from
            Col. Bradstreet, telling him that he need not proceed any farther, inasmuch as peace had
            been concluded with the Delawares and Shaw- anese. At that very time these same tribes
            were scalping settlers in all directions. Bradstreet was ambitious to gain all the glory
            of the campaign. Instead of minding his own business and compelling the Lake Indians to
            bring in their captives and give proper guarantees of sub- mission, he turned aside in
            his course to attend to the business assigned to Bouquet, who was his superior officer.
            As the whole scheme was a ruse on the part of the Ohio Indians to gain time and prevent
            Bouquet's advance, he' and General Gage were both indignant at Bradstreet and repudiated
            his officious intermeddling. Without delaying an hour, Bouquet pushed forward. September
            5, he had reached Fort Bedford, where more Pennsylvanians deserted, taking along their
            arms and horses. A large reinforcement of friendly Indians, prom- ised to be sent from
            the Six Nations by Sir. Wm. Johnson, never arrived. At Ligonier he received from Gen.
            Gage the hearty endorsement of his own conduct, and the re- pudiation of Bradstreet 's
            unwarranted and premature ne- gotiations with irresponsible representatives of the Ohio
            Indians. AND HIS CAMPAIGNS. 63 ARRIVAL AT FORT PITT. He passed safely over the historic
            field of Bushy Run to Fort Pitt, where he was rejoiced to receive the Virginia
            reinforcement. Ten Indians came to the opposite bank of the river, proposing a
            conference. Finding that they were evidently spies, endeavoring to gain important infor-
            mation, he detained two of them as hostages, and sent another one with two messengers to
            Bradstreet and a state- ment to the Ohio Indians that if any harm was done to these two
            men, the Indian hostages in his hands should be put to death at once and dire vengeance
            executed against their entire nation. Several Iroquois Indians came into the fort,
            pretending great friendship, and assuring him that the Ohio Indians would speedily
            return all the white captives. They spoke of the difficulty of pene- trating the hilly
            forests and the great numbers of the In- dians who would oppose the army, but who would
            soon ful- fil all his stipulations if he only remained quietly at Fort Pitt. The whole
            object of these crafty envoys was evi- dently to delay the campaign until bad weather
            and late- ness of the season made it impossible. Bouquet saw through their designs and
            sent them to tell the Delawares and Shawanese, etc., that he was on his way to punish
            their cruel and perfidious conduct unless they made prompt and complete submission to
            his terms. THE MARCH INTO OHIO. Early in October the army left Fort Pitt to cut a road
            directly through the unexplored wilderness of Ohio. The Colonel assured the troops of
            his confidence in their bra- very and told them that " he did not doubt but that this
            war would soon be ended, under God, to their own honor and the future safety of their
            country, provided the men were strictly obedient to orders and guarded against the
            surprises and sudden attacks of a treacherous enemy, who never dared to face British
            troops in an open field." Large droves of sheep and cattle were taken along for
            subsistence, besides great droves of packhorses loaded with flour and other provisions.
            The Virginia woodsmen acted 64 COL. HENRY BOUQUET as scouts and flankers in front and on
            the sides, whilst the pioneers cleared the road through the dense forest. The army, with
            flocks and herds and camp equipage, followed the pioneers at the rate of seven or eight
            miles a day, mov- ing constantly in a series of concentric hollow squares, with flocks,
            herds, baggage, packhorses, etc., in the centre. Thus in line of battle and guarding
            carefully against ambush and surprise, they moved steadily forward. Skulk- ing Indians
            were watching every movement, but no direct attempt was made to interfere with the
            progress of the troops. The strictest discipline was enforced. Be- fore leaving Fort
            Pitt two soldiers had been shot for de- sertion, and all superfluous women ordered back
            to the settlements. One woman was allowed to each corps, and two nurses for the general
            hospital. These were needed to look after the children and female captives, whose re-
            covery was one chief object of the expedition. In ten days the army reached the
            Muskingum, and was now in the heart of the Indian country. Near the fording of that
            river, they saw the wigwams of loo families of Tus- carora Indians who had fled in
            terror at their approach. The two soldiers sent to Bradstreet, now appeared, having been
            detained by the Delawares on trifling pretexts until they saw the invasion was an
            overwhelming success. They brought word that the chiefs would come in a few days to hold
            a conference. COUNCIL ON THE MUSKINGUM — CAPTIVES RESTORED. Bouquet marched along the
            Muskingum until he found ample forage in the broad meadows for his cattle, sheep and
            packhorses ; he erected a palisaded depot for pro- visions and baggage. Soon a number of
            chiefs appeared, stating that great numbers of warriors were eight miles distant, and
            that a place and time should be appointed for council. He designated a spot near the
            river bank where he would meet them next day. A party of woods- men soon prepared a
            rustic arbor, where English oflicers and Indian chiefs might meet under shelter. Every
            pre- caution was used to prevent a surprise or attack. Guards AND HIS CAMPAIGNS. 65 were
            doubled and no straggling allowed. The soldiers were drawn up so as to make the most
            stunning impres- sion upon the minds of the savages. And truly it was a wonderful sight
            to see such a vast body of troops fully equipped in the midst of the wilderness, with
            flocks and herds, and other resources needed for a protracted cam- paign. The scene was
            as picturesque as it was astounding m its display of miltary prowess. The Highland
            grenadiers were there with their plaids, kilts and tartans, whom the Indians styled, "
            petticoat warriors" on account of their queer dress. The Royal Americans were on hand
            with their bright red British uniforms, the duller garb and duller trappings of
            Pennsylvania troops and the fringed hunting frocks of the Virginia backwoods riflemen
            made such a combination of military pomp and power as has been rarely seen in any land.
            The chiefs came at the appointed hour — Kiashuta, or Guyashuta, the chief of a band of
            Senecas, Custaloga chief of the Delawares, Keisnauchtha, chief of the Shawanese, each
            with a band of warriors, were the leaders along with Turtle Heart, Beaver, etc., they
            tried to frame excuses tor their teacherous conduct, blaming it on the rashness of their
            young men and the western tribes led in person by Pontiac, they begged for peace and
            promised to return to him all white prisoners in their hands. Bouquet thoroughly
            understood the Indian character, and knew what demeanor and tactics suited the occa-
            sion. He told them to return next day to receive his an- swer. Inclement weather
            prevented their proposed meet- ing until the twentieth. Instead of calling them brothers
            he began : " Sachems, War chiefs and Warriors." He then addressed them with great
            spirit, and in severe and impassioned language. He pointed out the absurdity of their
            trifling excuses, and reminded them of their un- paralleled treachery and cruelty in
            plundering traders and settlers, capturing children and in assulting the king's troops
            in the woods at Bushy Run, last summer. He denounced their continued murderous forays
            upon the border settlements, and condemned their repeated failures to bring back the
            white prisoners in their hands. He will 66 COL. HENRY BOUQUET not be deceived longer by
            their false promises. " If," said he, " it were possible that you could convince us that
            you sincerely repent of your past perfidy, and that we could depend on your good
            behavior for the future, you might yet hope for mercy and peace. If I find that you
            faithfully execute the following preliminary conditions, I will not treat you with the
            severity you deserve. I give you twelve days from this date to deliver into my hands at
            Waukatamake, all prisoners in your possession without any exception, Englishmen,
            Frenchmen, women, children, whether adopted in your tribes, married or living amongst
            you under any denomination and pretence whatsoever, together with all negroes. And you
            are to furnish the said prisoners with clothing, provisions and horses to carry them to
            Fort Pitt. When you have fully complied with these conditions, you shall then know on
            what terms you may obtain the peace you sue for." Bouquet was as wise and sagacious as
            he was brave and generous. The manner as well as the sentiments of his address made a
            deep and lasting impression upon the sup- plicating savages. Their haughty spirit was
            completely humbled. They abjectly promised to comply fully with all the con- ditions.
            The Delawares had already delivered up eighteen prisoners. They handed over eighty-three
            small sticks indicating the remaining number of prisoners in their hands, whom they
            promised to bring in as soon as possi- ble. The Shawanese failed to respond properly to
            the Colonel's wishes, either by appearing at the council with their kings or by bringing
            in the captives in their hands. A sharp message was sent to them not to trifle with the
            patience of the commander. The army marched some thirty odd miles further to the Forks
            of the Muskingum, where it was agreed to await the prisoners instead of at Waukatamake.
            The principal chiefs of each tribe he kept in his possession as hostages to secure the
            fulfillment of pledges. Great care had to be taken to prevent a general stampede of the
            tribes and the murder of all the prisoners in their hands as well as to secure a full
            compliance with the conditions of restoration. Bouquet's management in- AND HIS
            CAMPAIGNS. 67 spired them with confidence and respect, while at the same time it filled
            them with terror and brought them into com- plete submission "to his commands. Runners
            were sent out in all directions, and soon several hundred captives were brought into
            camp. Among these were ninety Vir- ginians, of whom thirty-two were adult males and the
            rest were women and children ; one hundred and sixteen Pennsylvanians, forty-nine men
            and sixty-seven women and children were also returned. Many of the vol- unteers had
            wives, children and relatives among the cap- tives, and the scenes that took place at
            the recovery and recognition of the long lost loved ones were touching in the extreme.
            With great sorrow and reluctance the Indians parted with these adopted members of their
            house- holds. For, be it remembered, that when once an Indian had adopted a captive, the
            captive was henceforth treated as a member of the family and not as a slave. The cap-
            tive women were, as a rule, absolutely free from insult and were not even obliged to
            marry against their will. • The reverse of this is the case among many of the Western
            and South-western tribes of Indians at the present day, who treat their captives as
            slaves and always outrage the women. Many of the Shawanese warriors were absent on
            hunting expeditions, so that nearly a hundred captives could not be reached. Hostages
            were given for the safe delivery of these at Fort Pitt. Bouquet maintained a stern and
            indig- nant demeanor until all conditions were fulfilled as far as possible, knowing
            that any other deportment under cir- cumstances would be mistaken for timidity and
            indecision. Kindness can only be appreciated by a savage when he knows you have ability
            to overwhelm him if refractory. Having fully convinced them of his prowess and
            displeasure at everything like duplicity. Bouquet convened the chiefs in the rustic
            council house again and intimated his satis- faction with their conduct and his desire
            to arrange for a lasting peace. Guyasutha, the celebrated Seneca chief, who had been the
            leading spirit of the eastern wing of Pontiac's con- spiracy, and had led the forces
            around Fort Pitt and at Bushy Run, made the opening speech in the metaphorical 68 COL.
            HENRY BOUQUET and eloquent language so characteristic of Indian orators. "Brother," said
            he, addressing Col. Bouquet, "with this string of wampum I dispel the thick cloud that
            has hung so long over our heads, that the sunshine of peace may once more descend to
            warm and gladden. I wipe the tears from your eyes and condole with you on the loss of
            your brethren who have perished in this war. I gather their bones together and cover
            them deep in the earth, that the sight of them may no longer bring sorrow to your
            hearts, and I scatter dry leaves over the spot, that it may depart forever from memory.
            The path of peace, which once ran between your dwellings and mine, has of late been
            choked with thorns and briars, so that no one could pass that way, and we have both
            forgotten that such a path had ever been. I now clear away all such' obstructions and
            make a broad, smooth road, so that you and I may freely visit each other as our fathers
            used to do. I kindle a great council fire whose smoke shall rise to heaven in view of
            all the nations while you and I sit together and smoke the peace pipe at its blaze." The
            orators of each tribe spoke in similar strain promis- ing to lay down their arms and
            live hereafter in peace with the English. Bouquet replied to each and all as follows : "
            By your full compliance with the conditions which I im- posed you have satisfied me of
            your sincerity and I now receive you as brethren. The King, my master, has com- misioned
            me, not to make treaties but to fight his battles ; and though I now offer you peace it
            is not in my power to settle its precise terms and conditions. For this I refer you to
            Sir William Johnson, his Majesty's agent and superintendent for Indian affairs, who will
            settle with you the articles of peace and determine everything in rela- tion to trade.
            Two things, however, I shall insist on. And first you are to give hostages as security
            that you will preserve good faith and send without delay a deputa- tion of your chiefs
            to Sir William Johnson. In the next place these chiefs are to be fully empowered to
            treat in behalf of your nation ; and you will bind yourselves to adhere strictly to
            everything they shall agree upon in your behalf." AND HIS CAMPAIGNS. 69 These conditions
            were readily complied with, and chiefs duly designated for the mission to Sir William.
            And now having gained all his points, Bouquet to the great joy and relief of the Indians
            extended for the first time the hand of friendship, which hitherto he had reso- lutely
            refused to do. Nettowhatways, the chief of the Turtle tribe, having failed to co-operate
            properly in the peace measures, Col. Bouquet deposed him and directed his tribe to elect
            an- other chief and present him as their proper representa- tive, which was done a few
            days later. Nov. 12, Red Hawk, Nimwha, Lavissimo, Bennevissico, and other leading
            Shawnese chiefs made their submission. Red Hawk instead of proposing in usual Indian
            style to bury the hatchet (which might in that case be dug up again) said that they as
            younger brothers would take it out of the hands of their older white brothers and "
            throw it up to God " that they might never see it again. He then produced copies of
            treaties made in 1701 as, an evidence of the friendly relations of their ancestors. He
            promised that the remainder of the prisoners would be brought into Fort Pitt in the
            spring which pledge was kept. Many of the captives had become so fond of In- dian life
            that it was with difficulty that they could be in- duced to return to Christian homes.
            McCullough, one of the captives in his narrative says that Rhoda Boyd and Elizabeth
            Studibaker escaped from the whites and went back to the Indians. Mary Jemison, who had
            married among them, fled with her half-breed children and hid until the troops left the
            country. This would indicate that after their adoption captives was as a rule treated
            kindly and as members of their own families by their Indian captors. One of the Virginia
            volunteers had lost his wife and a child two years old in an Indian foray into the
            settlement six months before. What transports filled their hearts when he met her with a
            babe three months old at her breast ! Quickly he took her to his tent, and furnished
            suitable clothing for her and her babe. But what had become of the two-year-old darling
            captured with its 70 COL, HENRY BOUQUET mother ? She could not tell, except that it had
            been sep- arated from her and taken elsewhere after their captivity. A few days later a
            child was brought, in which was sup- posed to be the one in question. The mother was
            sent for, and at first was not certain that it was her child, but after carefully
            scrutinizing it she recognized its features, and was so overcome with joy that she
            dropped her young babe and, catching up the newly found child, she clasped it to her
            heart, and with a flood of tears carried it off. The father, picking up the child that
            she had let fall, fol- lowed his overjoyed wife and thus again the family circle was
            unbroken. The rough soldiers, and even the stolid savages were moved to feelings of
            sympathetic tenderness by such touches of human nature, which make the whole world of
            mankind akin. November i8, the army set out for Fort Pitt, followed by many affectionate
            Indians, who sought to help the cap- tives along in their homeward journey. In ten days
            the fort was reached just in time to escape severe winter weather. The regular troops (
            Highlanders and Royal Americans ), were placed at the different forts and posts on the
            line of communication, while the volunteers re- turned with the captives to the
            provinces. Those captives, whose friends had not been able to go with the army, were
            taken to Carlisle, where many persons who had lost chil- dren by the Indians, flocked to
            discover, if possible, their captured kindred. One German woman, from East Penn-
            sylvania, came in search of a daughter, who had been carried off nine years before. She
            identified one of the young female captives as her long lost child, but could gain no
            token of recognition in response to her loving en- treaties. The old lady lamented that
            the child that she had often sung to sleep on her knee had forgotten her in her old age.
            Bouquet, like a man of sense and humane instincts, told the woman to sing one of the
            songs or hymns that she used to sing to her when a child. Mrs. Hartman, the mother,
            obeyed as best she could, singing part of a very appropriate German hymn, of which I
            will give several verses, together with a translation by Rev. Samuel R. Fisher, D. D.,
            deceased. AND HIS CAMPAIGNS. 7 1 Allein und doch nicht gantz alleine Bin ich in meiner

            The sweet accents of her German childhood, fell upon her enraptured ears like the song
            of angels, and with a gaze of fond recognition, and a passionate flood of tears, the
            long lost daughter rushed into the outstretched arms of her devoted mother. Scenes like
            this threw a halo of religious romance around the expedition of Bouquet. Rev. Ruben
            Weiser has drawn out the story of Regina Hartman, the German captive, with confessedly
            large drafts upon the imagina- tion. He draws Conrad Weiser into the drama, although the
            great Indian interpreter had already been dead four years ! This is not more absurd than
            to foist in a German hostler to interpret between Mrs. Hartman and Col Bou- quet, who
            was well acquainted with German, French, etc., or his efforts to make Regina pass through
            a certain re- ligious process. Peace and tranquility were restored to the borders
            without bloodshed, and hundreds of captives were brought back from heathen bondage to
            blessings of Christian homes and civilization. Bouquet was the hero of the hour. Early
            in January, 1765, he arrived in Philadelphia. The people and authorities everywhere vied
            with each other in expressing their highest esteem for his character, and grateful
            recognition of his services. The friends and relatives especially of recovered captives
            were filled with affectionate and reverent admiration. PUBLIC THANKS TO BOUQUET. January
            15, 1765, the Assembly of Pennsylvania at its first setting, adopted a congratulatory
            and complimentary address, heartily thanking him for his great service to that province,
            by his victory at Bushy Run, Aug, 6, 1763, his re- cent campaign against the Ohio
            Indians, during which he AND HIS CAMPAIGNS. 73 had laid the foundation of lasting peace
            and rescued hun- dreds of Christian brethern from savage captivity ; and, finally, they
            thanked him for his " constant attention to the civil rights of his Majesty's subjects
            in this province." In like manner the House of Burgesses for the Colony and Dominion of
            Virginia, thanked Bouquet for his inval- uable services in subduing the Indians, and
            recovering so many of their people from captivity. They further requested the Governor
            to recommend Bou- quet to the ministers of King George, as an officer of dis- tinguished
            merit, in this and every former service in which he had been engaged. The gallant and
            chivalric Colonel replied in grateful acknowledgment and gener- ously awarded much of
            the credit of the success of his re- cent campaign to the efficiency of the provincial
            troops, and especially commended Col. Lewis for his zeal and good conduct during the
            campaign. Col. Reid, who was second in command, also received honorable mention from him
            as well as all officers, regular and provincial, who served in the expedition. INJUSTICE
            AND INGRATITUDE OF VIRGINIA. But every sweet has its bitter, and the oft-told tale of
            in- gratitude and injustice to benefactors must, alas, be re- peated. Virginia was
            lavish in her praises, as well she might be, for she had profited greatly by the
            campaign ; but when it came to foot the bill of expenses for her small body of splendid
            troops during the campaign, she repudiated the obligation ! " Tell it not in Gath,
            publish it not in the streets of Askelon !" Pontiac, the heathen savage, put such
            conduct to shame by scrupulously re- deeming every piece of birch bark currency issued
            in his name for supplies during the siege of Detroit. At length, after great personal
            annoyance and embar- rassment, Bouquet induced the Pennsylvania Assembly to pay the
            Virginia troops for services and expenses incurred during the campaign of 1764. By so
            doing Pennsylvania in some degree atoned for a multitude of past sins of neglect and
            indifference. But D 74 COL. HENRY BOUQUET Bouquet was stung to the quick by the conduct
            of the Virginians, and begs Gen. Gage to relieve him from his present command in order
            that he might make a trip to Europe. His request was granted. He wrote to Gage March 4,
            1765, "the disgust I have conceived from the ill-nature and ingratitude of those
            individuals (the Vir- ginia officials) makes me accept with great satisfaction your
            offer to discharge me of this department, in which I never desire to serve again, nor,
            indeed, to be commanding offi- cer in any other, since the new regulations you were
            pleased to communicate to me ; being sensible of my in- ability to carry on the service
            upon the terms prescribed." This had reference to some rigid prescriptions which he
            supposed fully closed the door against the promotion of foreign born officers. He seems
            to have intended to return and settle in the provinces, or remove obstacles in the line
            of promotion, for the day before writing the above letter to Gage, i. e., March 3, 1765,
            he was naturalized by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, in accordance with a late act
            of Parlia- ment. bouquet's promotion. And now to his great surprise and the
            gratification of all good men, Bouquet receives tidings that the King had promoted him
            to the rank of brigadier general. April 15, 1765, he wrote his grateful acknowledgment
            of the unexpected honor, which also gave assurance of prefer- ment to other deserving
            foreign-born officers, who were among the most devoted subjects of the King. Letters of
            congratulation came pouring in, especially from officers who had served under him. Capt.
            George Etherigton, of the first battallion of Royal Americans, who so narrowly escaped
            massacre at Michill- mackinac in May, 1763, wrote Bouquet as follows from Lancaster,
            Pa., April 19, 1765: "Sir, though I almost despair of this reaching you before you sail
            to Europe, yet I cannot deny myself the pleasure of giving you joy on your promotion,
            and can, with truth, tell you that it gives great joy to all the gentlemen of the
            battallion, for AND HIS CAMPAIGNS. 75 two reasons : first, on your account ; and
            secondly, on. our own, as by that means we may hope for the pleasure of continuing under
            your command. You can hardly imagine how this place rings with the news of your
            promotion, for the townspeople and German farmers stop us in the street to ask if it is
            true that the king has made Col. Bouquet a general ; and when they are told it is true,
            they march off with great joy ; so you see the old proverb wrong for once, which says he
            that prospers is envied ; for sure I am that all the people are more pleased with the
            news of your prornotion than they would be if the government would take off the stamp
            duty." Dr. Wm. Smith, Provost of the University and historian of his campaigns, spoke
            the common sentiment when he said Bouquet had become " as dear by his private virtues to
            those who have the honor of his more intimate acquain- tance as he is by his military
            service to the public." For this reason " it is hoped he may long continue among us,
            where his experienced abilities will enable him, and his love of the English
            constitution entitle him, to fill any future trust to which his Majesty may be pleased
            to call him." It had been Bouquet's hope and desire to visit England and to return again
            to the scenes of his earlier career among the Lowlands of Holland and the mountains of
            Switzerland, but the king assigned him to the command of the Southern military
            department, and as the Indians had recently become troublesome in that locality, he
            repaired to his new field of action without unnecessary delay. LEAVES FOR PENSACOLA.
            WILL AND DEATH. Before leaving Philadelphia he made his last will and testament, which I
            copied a few weeks ago at the office of the Register of Wills, in Philadelphia. It is in
            his own handwriting, and reads thus: " In the name of God, Amen. I, Henry Bouquet,

            amount of thirteen, including one to be given by Geo. Croghan, Esq., in the hands of Mr.
            Robert Cal- lendar, living near Carlisle, in Cumberland county ; amount- ing in the
            whole to two thousand eight hundered acres, for which I paid only the warrant money. I
            give and be- queath to John Schneider, the boy who is bound to me, the sum of fifty
            pounds currency to be paid him when he is of age by Col. Haldimand, to whom I recommend
            my other servants. All my just debts are to be paid, consist- ing at present in one

            interest. I give and bequeath to my father, if then living, or after him, to Col. Lewis
            Bouquet, and to his heirs all the effects of any nature, whatsoever, which I may be
            possessed of in the continent of Europe, without exception. I constitute and appoint my

            effect, any other will which I may at any time have made previous to this day, as this
            present will and testament contains my last and real intentions and disposition, and is
            to take place accordingly. In witness whereof, I have wrote, (written) signed with my
            own hand and affixed my seal to this last will and testament, in the City of
            Philadelphia, in Pennsylvania, this twenty-fifth day of June, in the year of our Lord
            one thousand seven hun- dred and sixty five. Henry Bouquet. Signed, sealed, published
            and declared by the testator as his last will and testament in our presence who sub-
            scribed the same as witnesses in his presence and at his request. Benjamin Chew, Jo.
            Turner, Thos. Turner. The will was probated Nov. i, 1765, on oath of the Turners, the
            other witness, Mr. Chew, being the register general. Soon after this and evidently with
            a good deal of reluctance, Gen. Bouquet set out for his new station at Pensacola, where
            he arrived Aug. 23, 1765, in the deadliest season of the year, and at once fell a victim
            to the fever so fatal to unacclimated persons. The following extract from the
            Pennsylvania Magazine for Thursday October 24, 1765, tells the sad story : "On Tuesday
            last arrived the sloop William, Capt. Rivers, in thirty-six days from Pensacola, by whom
            we learn ten sail of transports with troops (to relieve those on that station that are
            going home) arrived there, and that there has been a great mor- tality among them, ten
            or twelve dying of a day, amongst which was the gallant and worthy officer. Brigadier
            Gen. 7 8 COL. HENR Y BOUQ UET Bouquet. This gentleman had served his Majesty all the
            last war with great distinction. He was promoted from conscious merit not only
            unenvie.d, but even with the ap- probation and good wishes of all who knew him. His
            superior judgment and knowledge of military matters, his experienced abilities, known
            humanity, remarkable po- liteness and constant attention to the civil rights of his
            Majesty's subjects, rendered him an honor to his country and a loss to mankind. He
            arrived the 23d of August, and died September 2." Thus in the midst of his grow- ing
            fame and in the full vigor of manhood this superb man, who had faced death unscathed a
            thousand times in the forests and thickets of Pennsylvania, met his un- timely end from
            insidious disease, just as he was about to begin his career on a new theatre of action
            in the far dis- tant south. He died universally regretted, and his character and ex-
            ample were commended by contemporary writers as worthy of imitation by young officers
            who desired to win a lasting fame in the public service. He sleeps in a soldier's grave,
            far from home and kindered, far from those who knew him but to love him. But warm and
            grateful hearts in the North land cherished his memory and fame with fond affection 118
            years ago. And although for a time oblivi- on's waves seemed to have almost engulfed
            him, yet we see the dawn of a brighter day and feel assured that the fame of Bouquet
            will shine forth bright and beautiful as in days of yore. In the forum of all grateful
            hearts, among the descendants of Colonial ancestors or pioneer settlers, a monument
            deserves to be erected to the memory of Henry Bouquet more enduring than Parian marble
            or Corinthian brass. Reverently and gratefully I pay him this tribute, and would that it
            were indeed an amaranthine chaplet to adorn and perpetuate his memory, yea to call forth
            the homage of the good, the brave and the true, as the centuries go marching down the

            all I can in this matter, and I have accordingly submitted your letter to Mr. Lowell, to
            the Hon. the Secretary of War, for transmission to the Secretary of State for such
            action as may be consistent with public interests. Referring to your inquiry of the 9tb
            ult. , respecting the re- •nains of Bouquet, I regret to inform you, that the commanding
            officer at Fort Barrancas, Fla., to whom your request was re- ferred, reports under the
            date of the 7th instant, that he has made search and inquiry in Pensacola regarding the
            whereabouts of Gen. Bouquet's remains, but has not been able to learn any- thing about
            them. He further states that the oldest cemetery at Pensacola was commenced in 1780, and
            that those best posted in the matter have informed him that all the cemeteries at that
            place were destroyed prior to 1780, and that there is no trace of them left. The old
            cemeteries at Pensacola were probably destroyed in 1 78 1, when that town was besieged
            and taken by the Spanish General Galvez. I will make further inquiries regarding
            Bouquet's remains and apprise you of the result. Yours very truly, R. C. Drum, Rev.

            General Hancock's answer to my inquiries regarding Bouquet's remains. He informs me that
            upon the receipt of my letter he referred it to several officers who have been stationed
            at Fort Barrancas, Fla., for any information or suggestions they might have in this
            matter ; that they named certain persons who, they thought, could probably furnish the
            desired information, but that all efforts in that direction have thus far proved to be
            unsuccessful. The commanding officer of Fort Barrancas again visited Pen- sacola, with a
            view of obtaining some information of the remains 8o COL. HENRY BOUQUET of Bouquet,
            supposed to have be buried there. He interviewed k number of gentlemen, old residents of
            that town, and states thit none of them have ever heard of Bouquet. He also searched the
            old cemetery, which was deeded by the Spanish to the Catholic church in 1781, but
            without success, and finally states that — unfortunately — the records of the cemetery
            as well as those of the Catholic church, were destroyed by fire last summer, and regrets
            to state that it is impossible to gain any in- formation at Pensacola regarding the
            whereabouts of Bouquets remains. I am, yours very truly, { R. C. Drum, ' The Rev. Cyrus

            zeal and persistency ir. this research. He has always manifested deep interest in the
            character and career of Col. Bouquet, and as a West- morelander of old and honored

            BOUQUET, In an article written for Frank Cowan's paper, on the Bushy Run battle, nearly
            eleven years ago, I asked the question " does not Westmoreland county, yea all Western
            Pennsylvania owe a monument to Henry Bouquet ?" In my centennial speech at Hannastown, a
            year ago, I enlarged upon the same thought and, I trust, that in the Providence of God,
            I may see the day when the dear old county of my nativity will thus honor herself, as
            well as the grand hero who has made her* soil historic ground. All public spirited
            people should aid in such a work. It will stimu- late the young to emulate one who, amid
            perils and priva- tions, by sterling merit and conscientious fidelity to duty, rose from
            obscurity to become the peer of the greatest and best. It will help to demonstrate that
            no flight of years or changes of human governments and institutions, can oblit- erate
            the memory of genuine worth and true manhood, as illustrated in the history of Henry
            Bouquet. 82 COL. HENRY BOUQUET With Pericles, as amplified by Edward Everett at Get-
            tysburg, we may say of illustrious men " The whole earth is their sepulchre and all time
            themilleniumof their glory." Wherever heroic deeds have been done, wher- ever the
            battles of human civilization have been fought and won, that is hallowed ground, full of
            deepest interest to every thoughtful, true-hearted man. '' These are the shrines to code
            nor creed confined The Delphian vales, the Palestine, the Meccas of the mind." Bushy Run
            battlefield ought to be, and I feel assured will be looked upon, in years to come, as
            such a shrine. Here savage barbarism, as represented by Pontiac and Guyasutha, two of
            its noblest representatives, met the vanguard of civilization, culture and progress,
            under the matchless leadership of Bouquet. Here, too, was fought and won the battle
            which virtually established the supre- macy of the Anglo Saxon race, in the great valley
            of the Mississippi. '' The land is holy where they fought And holy where they fell." Not

            host, the Aryan or Indo-Germanic family of nations, was this typical battle fought and

            Westmoreland's sterling population. And it is meet that they should not forget the pit
            out of which they have been dug, nor the rock from which they have been hewn. The toils
            and privations of our colonial ancestors should be held in grateful and everlasting
            remembrance. They braved the perils of old ocean and of life in the Western wilderness,
            amid savage beasts and more savage men, for the sake of religious principle, and that
            their children might be freeholders and freemen in the best sense of the term. Let us

            out of the mouth of God." Ideas, principles, sentiments cultivat- ing a pure and
            progressive Christian manhood, are of vastly more account than the filthy lucre, on
            which so many set their hearts. The scenery and associations of childhood and youth are
            educational. They stamp their impress upon the soul for weal or for woe. Inspiring
            historical treasures are beyond all price. Many are the lines of thought and currents of
            history that centre in and around the honorable and eventful career of Henry Bouquet. As
            good men did in days of old, so now would I commend his as a character and example
            worthy of study and imi- tation by the young and all entrusted with official posi-
            tions. CONCLUDING REMARKS. Bouquet willed a large tract of land in Trough Valley, (
            Huntingdon or Mifflin Co., Pa.,) to Mr. Thos. Willing. This was a brother of Miss Annie
            Willing, hie fair corres- pondent. His extensive Long Meadows estate in Maryland lay a
            few miles north or north-east of Hagerstown, Md., and is now owned by the Lehmans,
            Willems, Cresslers, and others. Col. Haldimand, his legatee, and executor, was his
            special Swiss compatriot and military comrade. He fig- ured somewhat in the
            Revolutionary War, and became governor-general of Canada, from which post he retired in
            1785, to die in his native Switzerland. Many of Bou- quet's most valuable papers are
            included among those of Haldimand, at present, in the British Museum. The time to write
            a complete biography of the man has not yet ar- rived. Mr. G. D. Scull, of Philadelphia,
            residing at Oxford, England, expects to publish a very limited edition of some of these
            papers during the ensuing year. He claims that on one occasion Bouquet saved
            Philadelphia from sack and pillage, the proof of which will doubtless appear in his
            book. I had hoped to be able to refer to this proposed publication in the preparation of
            this sketch, but have been disappointed. 84 COL. HENRY BOUQUET PONTIAC'S SUBMISSION.
            Pontiac, for a season remained defiant, even after his confederates had submitted to the
            terms of Bouquet. When Capt. Morris went to him with proposals of peace, he met him on
            the outskirts of his camp, and refused to take his hand. With flashing eye, he
            exclaimed, " The English are liars." And yet he spared the captain's life, as he
            afterwards did that of I.ieut. Fraser, Mr. Croghan, and other peace envoys, although his
            warriors were anxious to slay them. He sought the country of the Illinois, with 400
            warriors, where the flag of France still floated, as it had done since the days of La
            Salle, Tonti, etc., in 1680. He urged the different tribes to rise again and fight for
            the preservation of their race, and threatened to de- stroy those who shirked. French
            traders had all along led him to expect aid from their great King. At length, he was
            fully convinced, by replies of French officers, in response to his embassies sent to
            Fort Chartres and New Orleans, that all hope of help from that quarter was vain. He then
            gave up the contest, and agreed to meet with other confederates at the great council,
            held by Sir Wm. Johnson, to arrange definitely the terms of peace, secured by the
            campaigns of Bouquet. Croghan, who met him repeatedly and experienced his magnanimity in
            restraining warriors who were anxious to kill the British peace-agent, speaks thus of
            the great Ottawa chieftain : " Pontiac is a shrewd, sensible Indian, of few words, and
            commands more respect among his own nation than any Indian I ever saw could do among his
            own tribe." Late in the fall of 1765 Capt. Sterling descended the Ohio in boats, and
            passed up the Mississippi with one hundred Highlanders of the 42d regiment to Fort
            Chartres, of which he took formal possession in the name of Great Britain. It was
            fitting that "those veterans whose battle cry," as Parkman says, " had echoed over the
            bloodiest fields of America," should consummate on the banks of the Father of Waters the
            work begun at Bushy Run, and es- AND HIS CAMPAIGNS. 85 tablish forever Anglo-Saxon
            supremacy in the new world. In due time Pontiac appeared at the great council held by
            Sir Wm. Johnson during the latter part of July, 1766. The following are the opening
            sentences of his speech: " Father, we thank the Great Spirit for giving us so fine a day
            to meet upon such great affairs. I speak in the name of all the nations to the westward,
            of whom I am the master. It is the will of the Great- Spirit that we should meet here
            to-day ; and before him I now take you by the hand. I call him to witness that I speak
            from the heart ; for since I took Col. Croghan by the hand last year, I have never let
            go my hold, for I see that the Great Spirit will have us friends." PONTIAC'S
            ASSASSINATION AND ITS EXPIATION. Everything was amicably adjusted at the council, and
            Pontiac, with many presents, returned to the Maumee, where he spent one season. He
            afterwards seems to have located in the region of the Illinois Indians, who were jealous
            of his presence, and who approved of his assassi- nation. Accounts differ in regard to
            this affair, Mr. Parkman adopts the Cahokia theory i. e., that Pontiac was killed at
            that place by an Illinois Indian who had been bribed to do the foul deed by Williamson,
            an Eng- lish trader, who feared that Pontiac, while on a drunken spree, was about to
            stir up trouble against the English, and thus interfere with his traffic. Mr. Matson
            contends that Pontiac was fatally stabbed by Kineboo, the chief of the Illinois Indians
            at a council, held near Joliet, in that state. One thing is certain, the Illinois
            Indians were held re- sponsible for his assassination. All the tribes that in former
            days had felt the magic spell of his eloquence and had responded to his bugle call, now
            leagued together to avenge the death of Pontiac by a war of extermination against the
            Illinois Indians. The follov/ing extract I take from an article which I prepared for the
            Guardian for August, 18S2, on the basis of Matson's theory : 86 COL. HENRY BOUQUET "
            Runners were sent to the Winnebagos, of the North, and the Kickapoos, of the South-west,
            who agreed to help avenge the death of the great Pontiac. Over the remains a council was
            held by the allies, who swore by the great Manito of war not to lay down the tomahawk
            until the fallen chieftain's death should be avenged by the destruction of the Illinois
            Indians, who abetted the cowardly deed of Kineboo. The Miamis united with the tribes
            already mentioned, and Bernet, the white outlaw, also with a band of warriors, joined in
            the bloody strife. The com- bined forces made the most formidable Indian army ever
            collected in the West. Death and annihilation to the Illinois was the sav- age oath of
            the ferocious avengers. The smaller towns along the Illinois river were first destroyed,
            and finally La Vantum, their great capital, which was defended by their bravest
            warriors, was suddenly assaulted. The skull and cross bones of Pontiac were borne on a
            red pole by the avengers. Their first attack met with a bloody repulse. A council of war
            was called by the invaders, at which the leading war chiefs, with fiery eloquence,
            advocated that nothing short of extermination of the Illinoisans would meet the demands
            of the case or be acceptable to the great Manito of war. The Illinois warriors had spent
            much of the night in dancing and premature rejoicing over the repulse of the assailants,
            and were taken by surprise in the morning. After terrific carnage, the allies were again
            repulsed with great slaugh- ter. But again and again they returned with reinforcements
            to the conflict. Thus for twelve long hours the carnival of death went on in and around
            La Vantum, the great Indian city of the West. Night came on, and still the battle raged,
            until a heavy rain storm put an end to hostihties. During the darkness and storm the
            Ilhnois Indians crossed the Illinois river in their canoes and ascended Starved Rock,
            the old site of Fort St. Louis, where Tonti had so signally repulsed the Iroquois. Here
            the remnant of 1 200 Illinois Indians, including 300 warriors, rallied and thought
            themselves secure. But the allied forces, not content with the destruction of the town
            and other property of the Illi- nois, quickly surrounded the Rock, determined to avenge
            the death of Pontiac by the complete annihilation of all who in any way approved of his
            assassination. With ferocious yells they rushed up the rugged pathway on the only
            accessible side of the rocky summit. But brave and desperate Illinois warriors, with war
            clubs and tomahawks, sent them bleeding and mangled down the steep declivity. Again and
            again did the fierce avengers attempt to storm the almost impregnable heights. Many were
            slain as soon as they reached the summit, and hurled over the precipice into the river
            below. After losing many of their brav- AND HIS CAMPAIGNS. 87 est warriors, the allies
            gave up the assault and began the slow and tedious work of starving out the besieged
            Illinoisans. At the time of the attack upon the town a French and Indian half- breed
            warrior, named Belix, who had greatly distinguished him- self in previous battles, was
            being married to the beautiful daugh- ter of Chief Kineboo. When the assault was made
            upon the Rock, Behx stood foremost and most valliant among the defend- ers, and with his
            war-club dealt death-blows upon many of the assailants. His bride stood near by to
            encourage her gallant lord, but when she saw him fall with skull cloven by a tomahawk,
            she uttered a wild scream and sprang over the Rock, falling from crag to crag until her
            lifeless body dropped into the river below. Fifty-one years had elapsed since the rock
            had been abandoned by the French, and the palisades and earth-works afforded but little
            protection against sharp-shooters who took possession of neighboring cliffs and joined
            in a galling fire upon the Illinois. Kineboo, whose rash and dastardly act had
            precipitated the war, was killed in this way. But soon a rampart, sufficient to ward off
            bullets was erected bj the besieged along the exposed edges of the precipices. But the
            worst enemy now began to assail them. Hunger began to gnaw at their vitals with
            remorseless tooth. The small supply of provisions, brought along in their flight from La
            Vantum, were soon exhausted. The Rock of refuge became an altar of sacrifice, of whole
            burnt offering, to the IlHnois in the end ; for their relentless foes never relaxed in
            the siege until the last Illinois but one had perished. A warrior, the solitary excep-
            tion, let himself down by a buckskin cord into the river on a dark and stormy night and
            escaped, but all the rest, — warriors, squaws and pappooses perished. Some of the
            squaws, in the de- lirium of hunger and thirst, would spring with their infants into the
            river. Warriors would make a sortie only to be slain or driven back by the merciless
            avengers. Some feasted on the dead. The death-song was chanted, and at last, when a
            final assault was made, only a few feeble survivors remained to be tomahawked. Thus
            perished the once powerful and arrogant Illinois, and thus terribly was the
            assassination of the great Pon- tiac avenged. Great must have been the magnetism of the
            man in life and death who marshalled the conspiracy which nearly drove the English east
            of the AUeghenies, and which combined the savage hosts of the lakes and the prairies to
            expiate "the deep damnation of his taking off" by a holocaust that is unpar- alleled
            even in the history of savage warfare and retaliation. Well may the old site of Fort St.
            Louis, on the Illinois river, near Ottawa, Illinois, the scene of the first white
            settlement in the Mississippi valley, two hundred years ago, be called Starved 8S COL.
            HENRY BOUQUET Rock, in commemoration of that closing tragedy and catastrophe in the
            history of the great tribe whose name is perpetuated not only by the river along which
            they roved, fished and hunted, and fought their numerous foes, but also by the title of
            one of the greatest and most prosperous states in the American Union." Thus was expiated
            the death .of Pontiac, over whose grave, as Parkman says, " more blood was poured out in
            atonement than flowed from the veins of the slaughtered heroes on the corpse of
            Patroclus." Let justice be done to the memory of the man who broke the eastern wing of
            the great conspiracy at Bushy Run, Aug. 6, 1763, and rolled back the advancing tide of
            savage barbarism. All honor to Colonel Henry Bouquet and his heroic army of deliverance,
            who consecrated by their blood and valor, the green hills of old Westmoreland and made
            them historic forever. WESTMORELAND COUNTY BEFORE AND DURING THE REVOLUTION.
            Westmoreland county was created by Pennsylvania pro- vincial authorities in 1773, and
            originally included all that part of the State west of Laurel Hill. A dozen other
            counties have since been created out of the same territory, so that for Western
            Pennsylvania it may be said that "Old Westmoreland" was the mother of counties.
            Hannastown, a hamlet a few miles north-east of Greens- burg, was the first county seat.
            Here justice was first dispensed, west of the Alleghenies, according to the civil code.
            William Crawford, afterwards burnt by the Indi- ans, was the first presiding justice,
            and Arthur St. Clair was the first prothonotary. The first court fixed the price of a
            gill of whiskey at four pence ; toddy, one shilling ; West India rum, six pence ; cider,
            per quart, one shilling six pence ; strong beer, per quart, sixpence. The jail was made
            of rough, unhewn logs. Punish- ments were fines, whipping, standing in pillory or
            stocks, cropping off ears and branding. Rape, sodomy, robbery, mahem, arson, burglary,
            witch- craft and concealing of a bastard child were punishable AND HIS CAMPAIGNS. 89
            with death, as well as murder. Virginia set up rival claims to a large part of the
            territory included in West- moreland county, and created West Augusta county to cover
            it. Lord Dunmore, her Tory Governor, organized a court at Pittsburgh Feb. 21, 1775, to
            offset the claims of Pennsylvania. Dr. John Connolly, a resident of Pitts- burgh, was
            the Virginia agent, and representative of Dun- more. He published a manifesto Jan. i,
            1774, inviting settlers to meet at Pittsburgh on the 25th proximo for con- ference,
            assuring them of the protection of Virginia. Arthur St, Clair, a justice of the peace of
            Westmore- land, issued a warrant and had Connolly arrested for a short time and confined
            in the log jail at Hannastown. Con- nolly, after his release, issued warrants and
            arrested the Westmoreland justices of the peace. The conflict con- tinued for about a
            year. Virginia's claims were recognized at Fort Pitt and in the Monongahela region.
            Yohogania county was created Nov. 30, 1776, out of part of Augusta and included the
            greater part of Alleghany and Washing- ton counties. Virginia courts were held for five
            years under these auspices. Virginia's price for lands being cheaper than those of
            Pennsylvania, the settlers in those regions generally sided with her in the dispute. At
            Bushy Run, Hannastown and Ligonier, with adjacent settlements, Pennsylvania interests
            and claims were upheld. This con- flict of jurisdiction caused great trouble 'and
            uneasiness, which was not allayed fully until the completion of the western end of Mason
            and Dixon's line, after the Revolu- tion. From the date of Bouquet's peace, dictated to
            the Indi- ans on the Muskingum, until the outbreak of the Revolu- tion, there was
            comparative peace and tranquility, so far as the Indians were concerned. The fur traders
            plied their lucrative traffic without molestation. The country began to fill up rapidly.
            When the VVar of Independence began, the sectional disputes were forgotten and a com-
            mon purpose was manifested to resist the encroachments of Great Britain. Hannastown has
            the honor of not only being the first seat of civil justice, west of the Alleghanies,
            but of leading the van in sounding the note of defiance in 90 COL. HENRY BOUQUET a
            formal public declaration of the sentiments that stirred the heart of the persecuted
            colonies. On the sixteenth of May, 1775, a convention was held at Hannastown, which
            denounced the acts of British usurpation and tyrrany, and took measures to provide for
            the common defence. Westmoreland was prompt in electing delegates, July 8, 1776, to
            attend the convention, which met in Philadelphia, July 15, 1776, to lay the foundations
            of a government, "based on the authority of the people only." That convention included
            many of the best men of the state — wise in counsel, brave and energetic in action. Men
            like Franklin, Clymer, Hiester, and Rittenhouse. West- moreland sent as her delegates —
            James Barr, Edward Cook, James Smith, John Moore^ John Carmichael, James Perry, John
            McClellan and Christian Lavingair. Before taking their seats or casting their votes,
            they were required to subscribe to the following : " I, , do profess faith in God, the
            Father, and in Jesus Christ, His Eternal Son, the true God, and in the Holy Spirit, one
            God blessed forevermore ; and do acknowledge the Holy Scripture of the Old and New
            Testament to be given by divine inspiration." A very correct and orthodox profes- sion
            of the fundamental doctrines of Christianity. The convention adjourned September 28,
            1776, after framing an excellent form of government, by the people and for the people.
            In fact, their work has formed the basis for all the state constitutions since adopted.
            And now came the horrors of war. To the everlasting disgrace and infamy of Great
            Britain, it must be said that she offered large bounties to cruel savages for the scalps
            of the frontier settlers, men, women and children. The British Governor, Hamilton, who
            had control at Detroit and along the northern frontiers, gave standing rewards for
            scalps, but offered none for prisoners. In consequence the Indians compelled the poor
            captives to carry their plunder to the immediate vicinity of Detroit, where, after
            having endured indescribable sufferings du- ring the journey through the wilderness, the
            poor crea- tures were put to death and scalped in cold blood to get the bounty.
            DePeyster, under orders from Haldimand, AND HIS CAMPAIGNS. 9' acted more humanely as
            commandant at Detroit. He encouraged the Indians to bring in live meat, as the pris-
            oners from the borders were called, rather than scalps, which he did not like to see. In
            this way he saved 300 frontier prisoners from a barbarous death. Prowling bands of
            savages continually ravaged the borders, and West- moreland was a favorite resort for
            the scalping parties. The old war path of the Catawbas and Cherokees from the south and
            southwest, with a tributary trail or path from Tennessee and Kentucky, went right
            through the heart of Westmoreland to the headwaters of the Susque- hanna, in western New
            York, where lived the Iroquois, or Six Nations, their inveterate enemies. After the
            conquest of the southern tribes by their powerful northern foes, they made periodical
            trips to pay tribute or show proper obeis- ance to the conquerors. The Mohawk Pluggy,
            located on the eastern branch of the Scioto, with a lawless and miscellaneous gang of
            ma- rauders, made frequent forays into the settlements along the Ohio and its branches.
            Generals Hand and Mcintosh, Col. Brodhead and Gen. Irvine commaded Fort Pitt during the
            Revolution, and although many expeditions were projected and a few abortive ones
            undertaken to carry the war into the Indian country, nothing serious was ever
            accomplished in that line to check the repeated incursions of the savages. Such a
            campaign and commander as carried terror to their hearts in their own native haunts in
            1764, would have secured safety and tranquility to a large extent. But the desultory and
            fragmentary efforts put forth from time to time for aggressive movements against the
            savages and tories, as a rule only resulted in greater hardships for the frontier
            settlers. McKee, the Girty's and other tories who had grudge against the frontier
            settlers, led on the savage demons with great craft and daring against the .exposed
            frontiers. In April, 1778, a Westmorelander wrote, "God only knows what may be the fate
            of this county ; but at pres- ent it wears a dismal aspect." May i, 1779, another wrote,
            " The savages are continually making depredations 92 COL, HENRY BOUQUET among us ; not
            less than forty people have been killed, wounded or captured this spring." A year later
            and the prospect was still more gloomy. Over forty settlers had been slain in the
            Monongahela region, and the raids were frequent from the northern Allegheny regions. "
            It really began to look," wrote Butterfield, " as though Westmoreland would again become
            a wilderness. The people, in a half starving condition, huddled in and about the forts
            and block-houses. The troops at Fort Pitt were ragged, un- paid, poorly fed, and of
            course discontented and inefficient. In August the Maryland corps deserted their posts
            on the frontier of Westmoreland, and in a body marched across the mountains. Lochry and
            his 150 picked men were surprised and destroyed in 1781. Crawford, another county
            official, met with terrible disaster and death in 1782; and thus the chapter of horrors
            and frontier suf- fering goes on. Brodhead and some of his subordinate offi- cers got at
            loggerheads, and in the midst of quarrels among officers at Fort Pitt the work of
            desolation pros- pered. Gen. Irvine was appointed, but although many campaigns were
            talked about, none but such as Crawford's, William- son's, etc., badly managed affairs,
            were actualized. The main army was engaged in the last death grapples with the British
            Lion along the Atlantic coast, and the western settlers were largely left to the mercy
            of the savages. The British were emboldened even to fit out an expedi- tion to capture
            Fort Pitt. Three hundred British and Tories, and five hundred Indians, assembled with
            twelve pieces of artillery, on Lake Jadagua ( Chatauqua ), in 1782, with this intention.
            Having learned, through a spy, that the fort was much stronger than had been sup- posed,
            the main object of the expedition was given up. The usual method of border warfare was
            then adopted, and marauding bands went into the different settlements. A feeling of
            unrest and apprehension pervaded the frontier. Many had been shot down and scalped, and
            prisoners carried off from the immediate vicinity of Forts Walthour, Klingensmith, etc.
            This sense of alarm found very timely and forcible representation in the petition of
            German set- tlers on Brush Creek, addressed to General Irvine, com- AND HIS CAMPAIGNS.
            93 mander at Fort Pitt, June 22, 1782. It sets forth the de- spondency and distress of
            the people on account of continued calamities ( Crawford's fate had just been learned).
            They speak of the great peril attending the gathering of the harvest, nearly ripe, and
            beg for some troops to protect them as they seek to gather in the crops, which are
            needed to save them from famine — as much to be dreaded as the scalping knife. This
            petition was signed by ancestors of many living Westmorelanders, viz. : George,
            Christopher, Joseph and Michael Waldhauer ( Walthour,) Abraham and Joseph Studabedker,
            Michael and Jacob Byerly, John and Jacob Ruthdorf, Frederick Williard, Wiesskoph (
            Whitehead ), Abram Schneider, Peter and Jacob Loutzenheiser, Hanover Davis, Conrad
            Zulten, Garret Pendegrast and John Kammerer. This petition is given by Butterfield,
            without the names of signers, on pages 300-301, of his valuable book, " Washington
            Irvine Cor- respondence." ATTACK ON HANNASTQWN. Three weeks later, July 13, 1782, a
            large detachment of the aforesaid Chatauqua expedition burst upon Hannas- town, the
            county seat of Westmoreland. They burned the town, and came very near capturing the
            fort, into which a few of the frightened settlers, with Michael Huff- nagle, the
            prothonotary, at their head, had fled for safety. Captain Matthew Jack, by his courage
            and presence of mind, saved many lives on that disastrous day, as he rode gallantly from
            point to point, even through the encompass- ing lines of whooping savages. Miller's
            station, near by, was raided by the Indians, and the greater part of a wed- ding party
            was captured, including the wife and daughters of Robert Hanna. Captain Brownlee, and
            several others, were tomahawked, after being led captives a few miles. Dwellings were
            destroyed, together with many horses and cattle. The settlers were so terror-stricken
            that the ripened harvest was not gathered in many places, and great want ensued.
            Connolly, the renegade Tory, whom Gen. St. Clair had confined in the log jail at
            Hannastown, is supposed to have led this party, together with Guya- sutha, the famous
            Seneca chief. 94 COL. HENRY BOUQUET About 20 persons were killed or captured in this
            foray. On the 13th of July, 1882, the centennial of this attack and repulse of the
            Indians and Tories at Hannastown, was celebrated by a large assemblage of
            Westmorelanders, in the woods near the old site of Hannastown. Hon. Jacob Turney
            presided, and made the opening address. Addresses were also made by Hon. Daniel Kane,
            Judge Bigham, Ex- Senator Cowan, and Rev. Cyrus Cort. RELIGIOUS CHARACTERISTICS OF EARLY
            SETTLERS. It is gratifying to know that amid their dangers and hardships, those Teutonic
            pioneers in old Westmoreland forgot not the God of their fathers. On May i, 1782, when
            the Reformed Coetus (Synod) met at Reading, Pa., a petition was received from " A
            congregation in Westmoreland county, near Pittsburg, in the back part of Pennsylvania, a
            new settlement, where no ministers have yet been." They " very earnestly en- treated for
            a good minister, to whom they promise to pay annually 80 pounds sterling, besides other
            necessaries of life." Rev. John William Weber, having expressed a willing- ness to go
            west and take charge of this mission enterprise, the Reverend Coetus recommended him and
            advised the Westmoreland people to give him a regular call. He ar- rived in Sept., 1782,
            and preached through what now constitutes Westmoreland, Washington and Fayette coun-
            ties, and at Fort Pitt, where the traveler Schopf met him in October, 1782. The
            congregations at Harolds and Brush Creek were organized a few months after Rev. Weber's
            arrival in Westmoreland. Here worshipped the Turneys, Drums, Barnharts, Marchands,
            Trubys, Mechlings, Kem- merers, Kifers, Klines, Byerlys, Whiteheads, Saams, Kling-
            ensmiths, Kunkles, Walthours, Baughmans, Thomases, Detars, Harrolds, Grosses, Henrys,
            Corts, Keppels, Kiehls, Shrums, Painters, and many other ancestors of Reformed and
            Lutheran families. Previous to the coming of Rev. Weber many of these German pioneers
            used to meet at the house of Loutzen- heiser and Davis to read the scriptures, sing the
            sweet AND HIS CAMPAIGNS. 95 hymns of the German fatherland, hear a sermon read by some
            competent person, and engage in other religious ser- vices as best they could. They
            frequently carried their rifles with them, when they went to worship in the early days
            of Rev. Weber's ministry. Prowling savages lurked in the thickets for many years. Amid
            such perils and privations, those pio- neer settlers carved out homes for their children
            and turned the western wilderness of Penn's woods into a fruitful field. Surely a
            grateful posterity should honor their memory and rise up and call them blessed, while
            enjoying the goodly fruits of their pioneer toil. At a still earlier date the Scotch-
            Irish, led by pastors Finley, Power, McMillan, Dodd, Smith, etc., occupied the Sewickly
            and other settlements, and already in 1781 the old Redstone Presbytery was organized. "
            The incursions of savages " prevented the first meeting being held at Laurel Hill, the
            appointed place, and so it met at Pigeon Creek. It is meet, as already said, that the
            descendants of the hardy Scotch-Irish and German-Swiss should occupy the green hills and
            fertile valleys of old Westmoreland. By the blood and the sweat and the toil of their
            pioneer an- cestors, this goodly land has been rescued from savage barbarism. Hallowed
            be the memory of the brave men and women who nobly stood in the breach in the hour of
            trial and danger. Pennsylvania has been compared to a sleeping giant, not yet fully
            conscious of her vast power and resources. With unappreciated modesty, she has failed to
            assert her rights, and especially has she neglected to cherish aright the rich legacies
            of the past, bequeathed by an honest and patriotic ancestry. It behooves us to gather up
            the his- toric treasures that rightfully belong to our grand old Keystone commonwealth.
            Our own self-respect and independent manhood de- mands this. It is no less a duty to
            posterity than a debt of gratitude to our heroic ancestry. The educational effect will
            be stimulating and ennobling in all respects. 96 COL. HENRY BOUQUET. For the sake of
            religious principle, our forefathers crossed old ocean's wave and braved the dangers of
            pioneer life in the new world. In the midst of untold perils, they were true to the
            principles of civil and religious liberty, as we have already seen, and here on our
            native hills was fought the decisive battle of Christian civilization against heathen
            barbarism. ADDENDA. Referring back to page 11, it is proper to remark that Bouquet and
            Washington were personally on good terms, and did not impugn each others motives. Many
            persons will doubtless feel prompted to contrib- ute toward the erection of a monument
            to Henry Bouquet, after reading the record of his gallant achievements. All such will
            please send funds or written pledges to James Gregg, Chairman of Finance Committee,
            Greensburg, Pa., subject to the disposal of the Executive Committee — Coulter, Kline and
            Gregg — for that purpose. P. S. — After this pamphlet was nearly all in type, I learned
            that at a meeting held subsequent to June 19, 1883, it was decided to invite the

            celebration of the one hundred and twentieth anni- versary of the victory won by Colonel
            Henry Bouquet over the Eastern Confederates of Pontiac, at Bushy Run, Aug. 6, 1763,
            brought together the largest and finest concourse of people ever assembled in Old
            Westmoreland county. The magnificence of the demonstration in honor of the gallant
            Bouquet and his Army of Deliverance, compensated in some degree for the long delay in
            commemorating their heroic achievements. The battle of Bushy Run, or Edge Hill, was not
            only memorable as an exhibition of dauntless courage and con- summate military skill
            under the most desperate circum- stances. It was so decisive and important in its
            immediate and remote results, that it well deserves perennial remem- brance. To
            perpetuate the memory of the great event itself, and its splendid commemoration, Aug. 6,
            1883, a memorial committee was appointed with the unanimous approval of the vast
            assemblage convened in Gongaware's woods on cel- ebration day. After some delay, they
            herewith present the result of their labors. Every movement of this kind has its
            history, in the light of which it can only be properly understood and appre- ciated.
            Accordingly it has been deemed advisable to give a brief sketch of the various steps
            that led the way to the celebra- tion of Aug. 6, 1883, as a proper introduction to the
            full account of the celebration itself. 1 The Bouquet Celebration. The Renaissance, or
            renewal of interest in Bouquet and his campaigns on the part of those more immediately
            identi- ^fied with the recent celebration, dates back to the autumn of 1872. On the 25th
            of September, of that year. Dr. Frank Cowan published an article in his newspaper,
            giving an ac- count of a visit to the battle-field of Edge Hill, or Bushy Run, and a
            sketch of the battle itself, as given in the old provincial work of Dr. William Smith.
            The young editor lamented the dearth or total absence of local traditions re- specting
            the battle as compared with the Burning of Han- nastown. He accounted for this on the
            ground that the battle was fought by foreigners, none of whose decendants had ever
            located near the scene of the conflict, etc. At the end of nearly two months, a mutilated
            copy of Mr. Cowan's paper, with the aforsaid article, fell into the hands of Rev. Cyrus
            Cort, then residing at Vinton, Iowa. Mr. Cort im- mediately wrote a lengthy article,
            giving an account of the battle of Bouquet and a number of incidents and traditions
            connected with it, which he had received from his great grandfather, Jacob Byerly, and
            his son Joseph on Christ- mas day, 1855, several years before the Revolutionary vet-
            eran ended his days in his ninety-ninth year. Jacob Byerly was a son of Andrew Byerly,
            the founder of Byerly Station at Bushy Run, and along with the rest of the Byerly
            family, barely escaped with his life to Fort Ligonier, in the latter part of May, 1763.
            After being closely besieged for two months. Col. Bouquet came to their relief with his
            Scotch Highlanders, Royal Americans, and a few Provincial Ran- gers. Andrew Byerly went
            along with the army, and was in the advance when the battle of Aug. 6, 1763, began on
            Gongaware's hill. He took an active part in the two days' conflict, and through him some
            very interesting incidents have been handed down to posterity which were never pub-
            lished until recent years. The article of Rev. Cort, besides supplementing the editorial
            of Mr. Cowan as regards inci- dents of the battle, urged upon the people of Westmoreland
            the duty of erecting a durable monument to the memory of Bouquet and his Army of
            Deliverance. The editor heartily commended the article to the atten- Antecedent Steps. 3
            tion of his readers, and called upon all who were interested in the history of Old
            Westmoreland, the mother county, to record without delay all traditional incidents and
            adven- tures with which they might be acquainted. Thus the mat- ter rested until
            December, 1880, when Rev. C. Cort pub- lished an article on Bouquet and his campaigns in
            the Guardian, a monthly magazine printed at Philadelphia. A revised edition of this
            article, with a poem on '* Bouquet's Grave," was issued a few weeks later in pamphlet
            form. 'Y\i^ Guardian article was republished in a short time by many of the papers in
            Southern and Southwestern Penn- sylvania, and created a good deal of interest in the
            hero of Bushy Run. A short time previous, George Harrison Fisher, Esq., of Philadelphia,
            had published in the Penn- sylvania Historical Magazine some interesting correspon-
            dence between Col. Bouquet and a Miss Willing, together with a sketch of the gallant
            Swiss officer. This was embel- lished with a fine steel engraving of Col. Bouquet, taken
            from an original painting in possession of the Fisher family. Rev. Cort was not aware of
            the article of Mr. Fisher until after the publication of his own. Again there was a
            pause until the centennial observances of the burning of Hannastown, July 13, 1882. As
            one of the speakers on that occasion. Rev. Cort in the course of his address made the
            following reference to Bouquet and Bushy Run : *'This is an age of centennials, and I am
            glad that the centennial boom has struck Old Westmoreland. It should have struck you
            nineteen years sooner. It has al- ways appeared passing strange to me that Westmoreland
            county, and Western Pennsylvania failed to celebrate with centennial memorial services
            the victory of Bouquet in the heart of our noble old county on Aug. 6, 1763. It is true
            that many of us were off to the wars in 1863, and had more important work in fighting
            battles for the preservation of the Union than to commemorate the deeds of colonial
            days. But there were enough men and women at home to have made the welkin ring with the
            grateful notes of centen- nial commemoration. An event so critical, so decisive and far
            reaching in its results, should be commemorated by an- nual as well as centennials
            observances. The heroic deeds ■^\'*^\ ^ 4 The Bouquet Celebration. of Col. Bouquet, the
            gallant German-Swiss commander, the Scotch Highlanders and Colonial Volunteers, that
            formed the little army of deliverance, deserve to be held in grateful and everlasting
            remembrance by all the descendants of the thousands of pioneer settlers in Western
            Pennsylvania and Virginia, who were then delivered from the horrors of sav- age warfare.
            Had such deeds of valor, and such inspiring associations been connected with any spot in
            New England, the Yankees would have made it pay long ago in more ways than one.
            Bouquet's battle-field, near Bushy Run, a few miles west of here, should be hallowed as
            historic ground, and honored by the erection of a monument that would vividly call to
            remembrance the deeds of the dauntless heroes who consecrated it with their blood and
            valor one hundred and nineteen years ago." In the latter part of October, the battle of
            Bushy Run was brought prominently before the public in the bi-centen- nial celebration
            at Philadelphia. Rev. Cyrus Cort, who was in the city at the time, wrote an article on
            his return home, which was published in all the Greensburg papers. We give the following
            extracts as bearing directly on the subject in hand, and because the article helped
            greatly in preparing the way for the celebration which came off, as suggested, on the
            succeeding anniversary of the victory of Bouquet : The battle of Col. Bouquet with the
            Indians at Bushy Run in 1763, formed a prominent feature in the gorgeous tableau that
            paraded the streets of Philadelphia on Wednesday night, October 25th, during the great
            Bi- Centennial celebration. Comparatively few of the spectators were well enough posted
            in the colonial history of the Keystone Com- monwealth to understand or appreciate the
            representation which held so conspicuous a position in the grand pageant Even so well
            informed and cautious a paper as the Ledger, spoke of it next day as a fight be- ween
            the British soldiers and the early settlers ! It seems that Major Beane received the
            suggestion from Mr. Stone, the Librarian of the Pennsylvania Historical society, who
            considers the victory of Bouquet over the Indians at Bushy Run, the decisive or turning
            point in the con- quest of the vast region west of the Alleghenies by the Anglo-Saxon
            race. The representation was rather too much of an anacronism. British soldiers and
            Indians were armed with the latest improved modem rifles. The very essential Scotch
            Highlander and Colonial Volunteer, features of the conflict, were ignored in the tableau
            for lack Antecedent Steps. 5 of proper costume for the characters, as the writer was
            informed by Major Beane. But certainly the Scotch societies, or the Caledonian club,
            that took part in Tuesday's parade, could easily have furnished this, and thus have made
            the representation much more correct as well as picturesque. The point, however, to
            which I wish to call the attention of West- moreland this time, does not concern the
            success of the tableau represen- tation of the battle of Bouquet so much as the
            importance of the event itself, and the rich historical treasures that necessarily
            cluster around the locality where that desperate and decisive conflict took place. Allow
            me in this connection to repeat a few sentences of my Hannastown Centennial address,
            delivered on the 13th day of last July : [Here follow extracts already quoted from the
            Hannas- town address which need not be repeated.] The sentiments then expressed have
            been strikingly confirmed by the estimate of the learned Librarian of the Pennsylvania
            Historical Society, and by the unusual prominence given to the battle of Bouquet in the
            re- cent Bi- Centennial tableaux in Philadelphia. In my monograph on Col. Bouquet,
            several years ago, I set forth the same views. It seems to me that it is high time that
            Westmorelanders, and the descendants of the Colonial settlers, should make an earnest
            practical effort to mark the battle-field of Bouquet, a short distance east of Harrison
            City, on the old Gongaware and Wannamaker farms. With the map of Hutchins, the royal
            geographer, executed soon after the bat- tle, and published with Dr. William Smith's
            account of Bouquet's ex- pedition, and with the aid of local traditions, this could be
            done with- out much difficulty. The little spring from which my great-great- grandfather
            Byerly carried a scant supply of water in his hat to the wounded Highlanders and
            volunteers, who were almost perishing with thirst during the two days conflict, would
            help to locate an important part of the field. * * * -x- * -x- * Old residents can
            easily designate the fields where the old forest trees contained so many bullets, when
            their land was cleared a generation or so ago. The exact route of the old road between
            Fort Ligonier and Fort Pitt could no doubt be definitely fixed at this point, so as to
            help determine the exact locality of the battle. The committee having charge of the
            Soldiers' Monument enterprise, of which, I believe, Gen. R. Coulter, Hon. Jas. C.
            Clarke, Gen. Thos. Gallagher and John Arm- strong, Esq., are members, could not only
            locate the outlines of Bou- quet's battle-field, but would be .a very good committe to
            receive funds and devise a suitable monument in honor of Col. Henry Bouquet and his
            gallant army of deliverance. * ^ ♦ * ^t * * The proposed soldiers' monument to
            Westmoreland military heroes might be so designed as to commemorate Colonial heroes like
            Bouquet, 6 The Bouquet Celebration. Revolutionary heroes like St. Clair, War of 1 812
            heroes like Markle, or Major Andrew Byerly, (whose command defended Commodore Per- ry's
            fleet while it was being built on Hake Erie), Mexican war heroes, etc., as well aslhe
            heroes of the latest and greatest of our American wars. ■X- * ** ¥: * • At all events, I
            trust that suitable efforts will be made at an early day, to define the main features or
            outlines of Bouquet's battle-field. Vice President Jourdan, of the Historical Society at
            Philadelphia, called my attention to the fact that Bancroft or some other standard
            author, stated that the scene of Bouquet's battle was unknown. I remarked that the
            statement was not correct, and that the battle was fought in the heart of Westmoreland
            county, a short distance east of Harrison City. Bullets, bones, etc., had in former days,
            been found there in great numbers, and the local tradition, together with the map of
            Hutchins, would enable any intelligent person to locate the battlefield. I am confident
            that the Pennsylvania Historical Society would cheerfully give room in their val- uable
            magazine for any communication on the subject which such a committee as I have
            designated might choose to make. In this way justice might, in a measure, be done to the
            memory of the departed heroes, while at the same time a pilgrim shrine would be erected
            in the grand old county of our nativity, that would increase in interest and importance
            as age after age rolled by. Might not the next 4th of July, or the 5th or 6th days of
            August be made memorable by a celebration, sham battles, speeches, etc., that would give
            the movement a successful impulse ? Judging from the interest he manifested in the
            monograph on Col. Henry Bouquet, several years ago, and more recently in one on " Baron
            Steuben and his relations to the Reformed Church," I believe Adjutant General R. C. Drum
            would honor and grace such an occasion with his presence if invited by such a committee.
            So also, public spirited Westmorelanders from all parts of the county, and from all
            parts of the Union, many of whom have become distin- guished in civil and military life,
            would esteem it a privilege and pleasure to take part in such a demonstration. Let us
            begin at the be- ginning in this matter of commemorating the deeds of departed heroes
            and benefactors whose names are linked inseparably with the history of old Westmoreland.
            Thus can we best secure proper remembrance and honor in the end for the scarred veterans
            and heroic dead of our late war, and at the same time stimulate intelligent interest and
            gen- erous emulation in the minds and hearts of the rising generation. The fame of their
            illustrious men is one of the noblest heritages of a people. Those who will not
            gratefully cherish the names and deeds of heroic an- cestors and benefactors, will
            scarcely do aught that posterity will delight to honor. For the sake of the living
            champions of constitutional liberty and union, and for the sake of unborn generations,
            no less than for the sake of the illustrious dead of Colonial days, I trust that
            Westmore- landers will do speedy and ample justice to the memory of Colonel Henry
            Bouquet, and the 1763 army of deliverance. Greencastle, Franklin Co., Pa,, Oct. 30.
            Cyrus Cort. Meeting in the Greensburg Court House. 7 The county papers generally favored
            the proposed celebra- tion and articles furnished by Rev. C. Cort and Hon. Jos. H. Kuhns
            in furtherance of the movement were, from time to time, published in the Greensburg
            Daily Press, and in sev- eral of the weeklies. April 25, 1883, a committee consisting of
            Rev. C. Cort, S. A. Kline, Esq., Maj. J. M. Laird, A. B. Kline, Esq. and Curtis Gregg,
            visited and located the Bushy Run, or Edge Hill battle-field in its main features, and
            selected a grove covering the same for the proposed celebration. MEETING IN THE
            GREENSBURG COURT HOUSE. On the following evening a public meeting was held in the Court
            House at Greensburg, to arrange for the celebra- tion. Ex-Governor Latta presided, and
            General Coulter and Hon Jacob Turney acted as vice presidents, with Maj. Laird, Frank
            Vogle and Curtis Gregg as secretaries. In an address of over half an hour. Rev. C. Cort
            reviewed the career of Col. Bouquet, and described the battle of Bushy Run and its far
            reaching results. He urged the pro- priety of getting up a celebration at the next
            anniversary of Bouquet's victory on that bloody field. Bouquet as the champion and chief
            builder of the Forbes road, from Bed- ford to Fort Pitt, in 1758, had rendered signal
            service to the province of Pennsylvania. A committee consisting of Revs. Love, Moorhead
            and Lucien Cort, and Philip Kuhns, Dr. Kline and A. M. Sloan, Esq., presented a series
            of resolutions providing for the celebration by religious services of a commemorative
            nature, in all the churches of the county, Aug. 5, and by addresses, poem, military
            display and pic-nic dinner in the grove on Bushy Run battle-field, Aug. 6, 1883.
            Committees were appointed as follows : Committee of Arrangements to secure and prepare
            grounds for the celebration : Amos B. Kline, J. B. Laux, Lewis Wannamaker, E. F.
            Houseman, Lewis Gongaware, William Moore, Mr. Shadwick, Jos. Clark, Robert Byerly, Wm.
            G. Shuster, Abner Cort. Committee on Finance : Jas. Gregg, Esq., Geo. F. Huff, Capt. J.

            Sebastian Baer, Esq., Hon. N. M. Marker, H. F. Lud- wig, Esq., Hon. John Hugus, and

            Invitation : General R. Coulter, Hon. Jos. H. Kuhns, Hon. Jacob Turney, Hon. John Latta,
            Maj. James M. Laird, G. D. Al- bert, Esq., John A. Marchand, Esq., Dr. Frank Cowan.
            Committee of Reception at Bushy Run on Monday — viz : Hon. John Latta, Hon. James R.
            McAfee, Col. Geo. F. Huff, John Kuhns and A. D. McConnell, Esqs. The chairmen, R.
            Coulter, Jas. Gregg and Amos B. Kline, were appointed an executive committee to fill all
            vacancies and have a general oversight of the celebration. A few weeks previous to the
            celebration. Rev. C. Cort published, by request of the executive committee, a pam- phlet
            of one hundred pages on ''Col. Henry Bouquet and His Campaigns." This document was
            received with words of hearty commendation by the religious, as well as secu- lar press,
            German and English, in Pennslvania, Ohio and New York. Lengthy extracts from it were
            inserted in the Pittsburg dailies a few days before the celebration took place. In this
            way the name of Bouquet and Bushy Run became familiar to thousands who had never heard
            of them before, and a deep interest was created in the ap- proaching celebration. Thus,
            too, the questions of some of the Pittsburg dailies two months previous, ''Who is Bou-
            quet, What Did He Do," etc., were measurably answered in a way that raised the subject
            far above the plane of ridicule. Amos B. Kline, with his colleagues on the committee of
            arrangements, did their work well. With the assistance of County Surveyor Wm. Miller,
            John Kuhns, Esq., Ed. Potts, Louis Wannamaker and Rev. C. Cort, the battle-field was
            definitely located and the exact positions of Bouquet's troops and their savage
            assailants, clearly indicated. The first and second positions of the troops ; the lines
            held re- spectively by the Highlanders, the Royal Americans and Provincial Rangers ; the
            location of the pack horses, the cattle and the Flour Bag Fort, occupied by the wounded,
            in the two days' fight were definitely marked with flags and handboards, and pointed out
            as they had not hitherto been for a hundred years. The Gathering of the Clans. g THE
            GATHERING OF THE CLANS — AUGUST 6, 1 883. All the necessary preliminary arrangements
            having been completed, the friends and promoters of the celebration awaited the dawning
            of the memorable 6th of August, 1883, with anxious hearts. It came bright and beautiful,
            as balmy and propitious a day as could have been desired for such an occasion. And never
            did the sons and daughters of Old Westmoreland turn out in such a vast and magnificent
            array as they did on that memorable day. Old and public-spirited citizens like Gen.
            Thos. F. Gallagher, who had attended all important convocations of our people for a
            generation past, declared that the concourse assembled on Bouquet's battle- field, Aug.
            6, was by far the largest and grandest of them all. It was the largest assemblage of any
            kind ever con- vened in Old Westmoreland, and by far the largest of the kind ever
            convened in Western Pennsylvania. Estimates of the numbers present vary greatly, ranging
            from 8,000 to 25,- 000. Dr. Samuel Stewart, who had considerable army ex- perience,
            named the latter number. It was estimated that between 2,500 and 3,000 vehicles were on
            the grounds or in the groves, fields, fence corners, etc., within a circuit of two miles.
            A large number of hacks ran during most of the day from Manor and Penn Stations, and
            thousands footed it from the railroad and neighboring towns. At Irwin, busi- ness was
            largely suspended, and L. Kunkle, with four Per- cheron horses, hauled on a large wagon,
            seventy-two per- sons to the battle-field. All other vehicles had been engaged weeks
            ahead. ''What would Colonel Bouquet have thought of this," exclaimed Ex-United States
            Senator Cowan to General Bea- ver, as they met at the outskirts of the crowd, on the
            Gen- eral's arrival. It was indeed a mighty host to honor the memory of Bouquet and his
            Army of Deliverance, on the very scene of their heroic achievements, after the lapse of
            120 years. If the ovation was long in coming, it made up in a measure for the delay by
            its splendid character and magnificent proportions. It was worthy the man and the
            occasion, and did high honor to Old Westmoreland, the mother of counties, and the mother
            of the great majority of lo The Bouquet Celebration. those assembled on the historic
            field, in social and patriotic communion. THE ORGANIZATION OF THE MEETING. A large stand
            had been erected in Gongaware's woods by the committee of arrangements, on part of the
            old Bushy Run battle-field. The stand was tastefully decorated with American flags and
            with several flags of the Swiss Re- public, loaned for the occasion by the Swiss consul
            at Phil- adelphia. The coat-of-arms of the Cantons of Berne and of Vand, the home of
            Bouquet, painted on large metallic shields, with their brown bears and motto, " Liberte
            et Patrie," held a conspicuous place. Relics in large numbers from Provincial and
            Revolutionary times, covered the tables. Prominent among them was a bayonet, found in a
            clearing on the battle-field, in good state of preservation, two years ago. Amos B.
            Khne, Esq., chairman of the committee of arrangements, called the meeting to order at
            half past ten o'clock, and nominated General Richard Coulter as presid- ing officer. The
            General made a short speech as follows : GENERAL COULTER'S REMARKS. Gentlemen and Ladies
            : You all know the object of this meeting. We are here to commemorate the memory of a
            brave and skillful commander, and a military achievement that had far greater influence
            in determining the character of the Western end of the State, than any event of later
            years. In the stirring times of later wars, the battle of Bushy Run had been forgotten.
            Its importance had not been appreciated, and it received but a small share of the
            attention which it deserves. But I am not going to make any speech. It is my duty to see
            the programme carried out. Prayer was then offered by Rev. B. F. Boyle, of Irwin. On
            motion of Dr. Frank Cowan, a committee consisting of Geo. D. Albert, Esq., Rev. Cyrus
            Cort and E. B. Kenly, was appointed to prepare a memorial of the celebration. The
            following is the list of vice presidents and secretaries : Vice Presidents : Hon. Jos.

            in front of the grand-stand, eight brass bands, from Greenburg, Latrobe, Ligonier, and
            other localities made the welkin ring with their martial and patri- otic strains. It was
            with difficulty that General Coulter succeeded in silencing some of them, so as to
            enable him to proceed with the programme. He then introduced Rev. C. Cort, of
            Greencastle, Pa., who made the opening address, as follows : 12 The Bouquet Celebration.
            ADDRESS OF REV. CYRUS CORT. Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Countrymen : We have
            longed to see this day, and we now see it and are glad. We have met in the leafy grove,
            under heaven's blue arch, in this temple not made with hands, to honor the memory of
            Colonel Henry Bouquet and the 1 763 Army of Deliverance. The skies are bright and the
            heavens smile upon us. It is right and proper that we should leave our shops and our
            stores, our mines and our farms, to mingle thus in social and patriotic communion. It is
            high time, indeed, that this should be done. Greensburg should have been called after
            Bouquet. Many of your sons should have been namesakes of the gallant Swiss hero, to whom
            we all owe so much. In- stead of this many living in sight of this historic field of his
            triumph, were ignorant of the first A B C of his history. Even the little village called
            after him, a couple of miles up the Manor, some of you used to spell with one ''u," and
            two t's, and two e's, (Boquette) instead of Bouquet ^ as the grand warrior wrote it. But
            all this dense ignorance has passed away, and even some of the Pittsburg newspaper men,
            who inquired a few months ago, ''Who is Bouquet?" are beginning to get some light into
            their darkened understandings. Let the good work go on. Every gallant young man ought to
            have a but- ton-hole forget-me-not bouquet on his coat to-day, and every young lady
            ought to have the beau without the quet — only let them take care that they have not too
            many strings to their bow, or too many beaux to their string. One is enough, if he is
            good, and too many if bad. But all jokes aside. I am heartily glad to see you here
            to-day. This is indeed a grand assemblage of the beauty and chivalry. Fair women and
            brave men of Old Westmoreland, and honored citizens of the Republic from abroad,
            distinguished in the forum and the field, are here to grace and honor the occasion with
            their presence — men who have poured out their blood like water on the battle-fields of
            the Republic. As a grateful and progressive people, we dare never for- get the toils,
            the dangers and hardships of our pioneer an- Address of Rev. Cyrus Corf. 13 cestors. The
            wilderness has been turned into a fruitful field and the desert made to blossom like the
            rose, but it was by the sweat and blood of brave and hardy men ; the fruits ot whose
            labor we now enjoy. This is hallowed ground, and sacred are the memories that cluster
            around this spot. One hundred and twenty years ago, this very forenoon, the
            representative champions of Christian civilization and human progress made the gallant
            charge around and through this grove that rolled back the exulting hosts of barbarism.
            Here was executed that masterly stratagem that shattered the right flank and front of
            the encompassing host of savages. Here was broken the eastern wing of Pontiac's great
            conspiracy. Here it was that Bouquet plucked the flower of safety and success from the
            nettle of danger. Here, from the very jaws of defeat, disaster and death, he snatched a
            glorious victory. Here the die was cast and the stakes were lost, and lost forever, by
            the impetuous confederates of Pontiac. Here was fought and won the battle that decided
            Anglo-Saxon supremacy in the Valley of the Mississippi. Here the kilted and plaited
            Highlander, from Caledonia's hills, the red-coated Royal Americans (mostly of German and
            Swiss extraction), and their comrades, the Provincial Ranger, from East Penn- sylvania
            and .Maryland, all fought side by side, and triumphed under the masterful leadership of
            that superb of- ficer who hailed from the Alpine Mountains of Republican Switzerland.
            This is indeed hallowed ground on which we stand to-day. "A shrine to code nor creed
            confined, A Delphian vale, a Palestine ; A Mecca of the mind." All true-hearted men and
            women will delight to honor the memory of the gallant heroes who fought and fell on this
            bloody field. But we, who are the beneficiaries of their self-sacrificing toil and
            valor, we, in whose veins flows the blood of Scotch-Irish and German-Swiss ancestors ;
            above all, we, whose pioneer ancestors were rescued from the tomahawk and scalping-knife
            of the blood-thirsty savages, we, my countrymen, one and all, may well unite in paying
            homage to the memory of the brave men who consecrated 14 The Bouquet Celebration. these
            hills and these vales with their blood and their daunt- less courage 120 years ago. "
            The land is holy where they fought, And holy where they fell." The lofty example of
            heroism, the steadfast devotion to duty even unto death, the magnanimous response to the
            cries of panic-stricken settlers and of beleaguered frontier garri- sons in deadly
            peril, the virtues that exalt and adorn human nature, which were illustrated on this
            gory field in trying days of yore, dare not be forgotten — all this is full of in-
            struction and inspiration. ^'^ There is a spirit in man, and the inspiration of the
            Almighty giveth him understanding." /' Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every
            word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God." The Almighty gives us words of direct
            revelation as we have them recorded in the Sacred Scriptures, and words of Providential
            manifestation in the unfoldings of history; words of solemn import and energizing power
            for all who have ears to hear and eyes to see. Ideas and sentiments, such as come from
            ennobling historical associations and surroundings, are more to be prized than silver or
            gold. They enter into the warp and woof and become part of the texture of communities
            and nations. And here to-day, my countrymen, we gather for ourselves and our children
            some of the rich, historic treasures of the past, and we catch an inspiration in
            contemplating the worthy deeds of departed heroes and benefactors of the human race.
            Life is flat and stale and monotonous, indeed, when it lacks sentiment and enthusiasm —
            I mean enthusiasm in the true sense — the stirrings of Deity within us, prompt- ing us
            to realize high ideas of manhood and womanhood in whatever sphere Providence may call us
            to occupy. "Without enthusiasm nothing truly great was ever achieved," says Senecca, the
            greatest of heathen moralists. It gives rapture to the poet, heroism to the warrior,
            devo- tion to the martyr, ardor to the patriot, lifting them above their narrow
            selfishness into the plane of superhuman effort and consecration. The will, the
            intellect, yea our entire ieing in body and Address of Rev. Cyrus Cort. 15 soul must be
            enthused with grand ideas of truth and duty if we shall ever effectually help forward
            the race in its ceaseless efforts to reach the final goal of history and humanity. A
            stagnant and treadmill existence, indeed, is that of the Mongolian and other Orientals
            who are largely destitute of sentiment and enthusiasm. But we, who represent a
            cosmopolitan population ; we who belong to the great Republic of the New World, which
            embraces in one vast national existence all the historic tribes of humanity, the kindred
            streams of the great Teutonic or Indo-Germanic family of nations, we must gather and
            cherish the achievements of by-gone ages and especially those that so deeply concern our
            own life and history. Only by learning aright the lessons of the past can we go forward
            with safety and courage in the future. Rooted and grounded in principles and sentiments
            that have stood the test of the ages we may take hostages of futurity and march in the
            vanguard of human progress. Then, as Tennyson has expressed it : " Not in vain the
            distance beacons forward, forward, let us range ; Let the great world spin forever, down
            the ringing grooves of change ; Through the shadows of the globe we sweep into the
            younger day ; Better fifty years of Europe Than a cycle of Cathay * * * Oh, I see the
            crescent promise of my spirit hath not set; Ancient founts of inspiration well through
            all my fancy yet." Yes, one year of American life full of vigorous thought and progress
            is better than a thousand years of monotonous treadmill Oriental existence.
            Civilization, and especially Christian civilization, makes history possible. The red men
            roamed through these forests for countless ages, but their lives and their labors were
            like water spilt upon the ground which can never be gathered up for the benefit of
            others. No reliable records have they to show the pit from which they were dug and the
            rock from which they were hewn — hence fundamental elements of progress and improvement
            are lacking. Great men lived before Agamemnon but they had no Homer to sing their
            praises and immortalize their deeds, and so far as instruction and inspiration to others
            are con- cerned they lived and toiled and struggled in vain. 1 6 The Bouquet
            Celebration. In order to be true to ourselves and those who shall come after us, we must
            cherish and record the deeds of those who have gone before us as the master spirits of
            our race. Among these the pioneers who took their lives in their hands to carve out
            homes for themselves and their children, dare not be forgotten. The muse of poetry and
            the muse of history must be in- voked, as we have invoked them here to-day, in behalf of
            one of " The few, the immortal names That were not born to die." The contemplation of
            noble characters and great achieve- ments is in itself ennobling. It lifts us out of the
            narrow rut of our own selfishness into a higher and purer atmos- phere. Anniversary
            commemorations, orations, poems, historical records, monuments such as I hope to see
            crown these hills in honor of Bouquet, these enshrine, crystalize, and local- ize, great
            and decisive events. They are educational and stimulating to the young in the highest
            degree. As the soul of Thucyides was enthused with the lofty resolve to emulate the
            works of Herodotus when he heard them read for the first time at the Olympic games, so
            amid such scenes as these the young and gifted sons of genius feel within them the
            kindlings of high and honor- able effort. " Immortal fame is a grand thought, It is
            worthy the toil of the noble hearted." ** Fame is a spur to brave a;id honest deeds And
            who despises fame will soon renounce the virtues that deserve it." But fame must have an
            enduring basis of genuine worth and merit ; fraud and falsehood vitiate everything that
            they touch. Not only the makers, but the lovers of lies, shall be excluded from the
            company of the blessed in the New Jerusalem above. We must love and seek truth as the
            jewel of the soul, as the pearl beyond all price, as that which allies us to the great
            and omnipotent Jehovah. Justice and judgment ^re the habitation of His throne, the place
            where His Honor dwelleth. The poorest widow, with a just cause, is stronger before

            mightiest monarch that ever sat upon an earthly throne. ''The hypocrite's hope shall
            perish." " The refuge of lies shall be swept away." There is a Nemesis of History which
            sooner or later avenges the wrongs of the past and vindi- cates with just judgment the
            inexorable claims of truth and righteousness. The locomotive may take the place of the
            pack horse, the four horse reaper and steam separator may take the place of the sickle
            and the flail of our forefathers, the telegraph may take_the place of the express rider,
            and ten thousand other improvements be made in art and science and material industries,
            but the old-fashioned principles of morality and religion are unchangeable, and eternal
            ''Jesus Christ is the same, yesterday, to-day and forever." " The holiest among the
            mighty, and the mightiest among the holy, who with His pierced hands has lifted empires
            off their hinges, turned the streams of centuries, and still governs the ages. ' ' As
            Julia Ward Howe has expressed it in the Grand Battle Hymn of the Republic : Let the Hero
            born of woman, crush the serpent with his heel, He has sounded forth the trumpet that
            shall never call retreat, He is sifting out the hearts of men before His judgment seat ;
            O, be swift, my soul, to answer Him; be jubilant my feet. In the beauty of the lilies,
            Christ was born across the sea. With a glory in his bosom that transfigures you and me,
            As he died to make men holy, Let us die to make men free, While God is marching on. Yes,
            make men free ! free in the highest and noblest sense of that word. " He alone is free
            whom the truth makes free, and all are slaves beside." For the sake of religious
            principle, our forefathers came to this new world, and we are degenerate sons of noble
            sires if we barter away the precious birthright. Let us be true to the God of our
            fathers, and He will never for- sake us. Men and women of Westmoreland, and all good
            people here assembled, this is a great day, a "red letter day" in the history of our
            grand old county. 1 8 The Bouquet Celebration. Here, on this ground, hallowed by the
            blood and strug- gles of the Swiss and the Scot, on this historic field of Edge Hill and
            Bushy Run, let us dedicate our lives anew to the sacred cause of Christian civilization
            and constitutional lib- erty. Bouquet was a free-born Switzer. In the land of Tell and
            Winkleried he breathed the air of freedom. In the armies of the Dutch Republic, the
            pioneer of our own great Repub- lic, he gained his first laurels and won distinction.
            His sword was always drawn in behalf of the land that best repre- sented the cause of
            civil and religious liberty. He sincerely loved the British Constitution, the princi-
            ples of Magna Charta, dear to every Anglo-Saxon heart. He indignantly resigned his high
            position in the King!s ser- vice, when he thought it involved some degree of humilia-
            tion, which he, as a high-souled man, could never brook. For what he was in himself, for
            what the poor Swiss boy from the shadow of the Alps made of himself as the peer of the
            greatest and best among the foremost nations on the face of the earth ; for what he did
            for us and our pioneer an- cestors, we commend his example, we honor his memory and
            invoke for him an undying fame. " Cold in the dust the cherished form may lie," As it
            has lain for lo ! these j 1 8 years, in an unknown grave in the sunny South. '* But that
            which made this man and men like him, can never die." With Pericles and Edward Everett,
            we may say of illus- trious men, " the whole earth is their sepulchre, and all time the
            millennium of their glory." Oh, land of the brave and free ! Bright as the noonday sun.
            Long as your streams shall run, Let the fame of the Switzer be. The papers state that
            Rev. C. Cort spoke in a loud, clear voice, and was frequently applauded. General Coulter
            then introduced the poet of the day, who delivered his production in good style, as
            follows : Poem of Dr. Frank Cowan. 19 THE POEM OF DR. FRANK COWAN. THE BATTLE OF BUSHY
            RUN. What ! Poet, wouldst thou sing of war ? — of human strife and slaughter? Of severed
            limbs and shattered bones? — of heart's-blood shed like water ? — Of Murder in its
            maddest mood, agasp with fiery breath. Leaving the world without a sun, a blackened
            waste in death ? Aye, wouldst thou, in this Christian land, extol the God of War ? — Or
            Scythian Sword, the Roman Mars, the Scandinavian Thor, Or Mexic monster, Hindoo ghoul —
            whatever it may prove, Forefend against it, Jesus Christ, thou God of Peace and Love !
            Yea, Man of Peace, I sing of war ! — of butchery and blood ! — Heads hot with rage,
            hearts hard with hate, and hands with gore im- brued ! — Destruction crushing into dust
            the noblest forms of earth Th' Eternal and the Infinite unite in giving birth ! Yea, war
            ! red-handed, raging war ! in its most direful form ; The struggle for existence in a
            fierce organic storm ! The lightning's flash, the dart of death, the sword, the barb,
            the ball ! The thunder's crash, the vanquisht's groan, the victor's shout o'er all!
            Sublime, thou call'st the storm at sea, the wind and wave contending, — Sublime, the
            earthquake suddenly the very mountains rending, — And the volcano belching fire and
            smoke for miles afar, — But what are these but bubbles when compared with human war !
            Consider, for a moment, Man, the all-involving world Turned outside-in in flesh and
            blood, and into action whirled — Sphere crushing sphere, sun burning sun, an universal
            jar ! — And thou canst measure if thou wilt the majesty of war ! But why this eulogy of
            war, this bright and happy day. Within this peace-appareled wood, in holiday array.
            Where men and women, boys and girls, commingle without strife, As if with darkness Death
            had left the world to light and Life ! Here, where we stand, the battle raged : the
            hosts contending, those Whom time and place and circumstance had made relentless foes —
            The Civilized and Savage man — the White and Red of hue — The East and West of place of
            birth — the Old World and the New ! A symbol battle of the world ! A race opposing race.
            Expanding in significance throughout all time and space ; The victory declaring for the
            good above the evil, — Life over Death, — Heaven over Hell, — a God above a Devil ! In
            proof whereof, The Continent, from one sea to the other, To fifty millions of mankind a
            mighty nation- mother ! — 20 The Bouquet Celebration. Her breasts outnumbering
            countlessly the dugs of the Diana The old Ephesians painted black — Earth bearing Man
            and Manna ! A mother to increase until exhausted with old age, Five hundred million
            softs or more in civil strife engage — Depopulating cities, states — leaving the land a
            prey To those by might and worth decreed, a better race than they ! So Rome and Greece,
            and Egypt fell — the glories of an age, In the unfinished book of time a multilated page
            ; Like ox and ass with broken backs, their usefulness outlived, The world the better for
            their death, their ultimate achieved ! So Turkey, China fall to-day — their masses much
            more fit To mingle with the mundane mud than to emerge from it ; Like the Great Auk and
            Dodo, or the Saurians of the Past, The world the better for their bones in solid stone
            encased ! Then let the cheer go round and round, for war, relentless war ! That purifies
            the planet till it glows a heavenly star ! Sweeping away the weak and vile — as in this
            very wood — Leaving ttie globe a heritance to him of worthiest blood ! Aye, let the
            cheer go round and round, in honor of the few Who on this field of battle won a New
            World for their due — This glorious Land of Liberty ! the worth-reward of Man ! America,
            the Mighty, where HE IS THE KING THAT CAN ! This closed the literary exercises of the
            forenoon. It was now after twelve o'clock and the meeting took a recess for dinner.
            DINNER. In families and groups of families the vast assemblage partook of a pic-nic
            dinner in the grove and adjacent fields. Everybody seemed to be in excellent spirits and
            a grand good time they had of it. The trip to the battle-field, the bracing and balmy
            air and the pleasurable excitement of the occasion added a relish to the repast by
            increasing the keenness of the appetite. The lemonade and restaurant stands did a
            thriving business. Not a few persons lost their friends in the crowd and had to depend
            upon some good Samaritan for rations. Rev. Cort, in a vain attempt to find his
            commissary stores, ran across Gen. Beaver and his three boys who had just come upon the
            grounds. The General's horses were provided for in Wannamaker's barn and the The Dinner.
            21 party then set out in search of friends with whom they ex- pected to get dinner. But
            it was a useless seach amid that seething mass of humanity. Messrs. Hazlet and Stark,
            with their families, had just finished a sumptuous repast but had plenty and to spare.
            The overplus they kindly placed at the disposal of the General, the preacher and the
            boys, all of whom heartily enjoyed their improvised meal at the edge of the grove. The
            General then made a rapid survey of the field of battle, springing along so nimbly and
            rapidly on his crutches that his clerical guide had hard work to keep up as he sought to
            explain the respective positions of Bouquet's Highlanders, Royal Americans and Rangers
            on the one hand and that of their savage assailants on the other. All this while Col.
            Geo. F. Huff, ex-Gov. Latta and other members of the Reception Committee were on the
            lookout for Gen. Beaver in order to furnish him escort and enter- tainment. The
            afternoon proceedings, however, brought all speakers and committees into right relation
            with each other at the grand stand. A little Indian (Guyatau or Guito) of the Seneca
            tribe, from the Cattaraugus Reservation, under the care of Mr. Gibson, of Dunbar,
            Fayette county, Pa., was on the stand, dressed up in full Indian costume and attracted
            great atten- tion. Guyasutha, the chief of the Senecas located in Ohio, was the leading
            spirit among the Indians in this battle and in the siege of Fort Pitt and subsequently
            in the attack on Hannastown. (See appendix). Hence this little copper- colored,
            dark-eyed Indian, with tomahawk and other war- like equipments, was looked upon as a
            representative of the vanishing race of red men who made these woods hideous with their
            war-whoops 120 years ago to-day. Guyatau or Guito is seven years old and a smart looking
            Indian boy. In striking contrast with him in appearance and historical association there
            sat with his mother on the same platform, a few feet distance from Guyatau, Ralph
            Bouquet, a fair- skinned, light-haired, rosy-cheeked, blue-eyed white boy, the
            four-year-old son of Rev. Cyrus Cort, and the great- great-great-grandson of Andrew
            Byerly, the founder of Byerly's Station at Bushy Run about 1760, and an import- ant
            actor in the bloody drama enacted on these hills in 22 The Bouquet Celebration. those
            trying days of yore. Andrew Byerly was one of the advance guard of eighteen who received
            the first fire of the savages, Aug. 5, 1763, on Gongaware's hill — twelve of the
            eighteen fell — two companies of the Highlanders rushed for- ward to the rescue when the
            conflict soon raged, not only in the front, but on both flanks and the rear, for the
            savges had completely surrounded Bouquet and his little army. Byerly rendered valuable
            service during the fight, and at the im- minent risk of his life, carried water in his
            hat to the wounded Highlanders famishing from thirst during the ter- rible night of
            suffering and suspense between the two days of conflict. (For fuller notice of Andrew
            Byerly, etc., see pages 23, etc., 51, etc., of pamphlet on ''Col. Henry Bou- quet and His
            Campaigns.") AFTERNOON PROCEEDINGS AND SPEECHES. The appearance of General Beaver on the
            platform, ere" ated great enthusiasm among the assembled multitude which had now crowded
            together again in front of the speaker's stand. The sea of smiling faces, the thousands
            of handsome and well dressed ladies and their gallant escorts, parents with their
            children, beaux with their sweethearts, sitting and standing among the forest trees and
            anxious to see and hear the one-legged hero, whose blood had been poured out so freely
            on so many battle-fields of the Republic, presented a scene never to be forgotten by
            those who were privileged to behold it. Visitors from a distance spoke with admira- tion
            of the fine appearance and excellent behavior of the people. Everybody seemed happy and
            anxious to promote the comfort and happiness of their fellows. There was one drawback,
            however. Eight brass bands were scattered through the grove, and each of these bands
            seemed to think that they ought to be heard whenever they felt like blowing their horns.
            Rev. W. W. Moorehead, of Greensburg, Pa., had offered an appropriate and fervent prayer,
            and General Coulter had introduced General Beaver amid the applause of 10,000
            enthusiastic people. But still the bands kept tooting away. By extra effort on the part
            of his aids, com- Address of Gen. James A. Beaver. 23 parative quiet was' secured, and
            General B., in a pleasant manner and loud, clear voice, proceeded to speak as follows :
            ADDRESS OF GENERAL JAMES A. BEAVER, OF BELLEFONTE, PA. Ladies and Gentlemen : — I
            confess to you that my com- ing here to-day has been more for my own gratification and
            instruction than with the hope or for the purpose of saying anything either to gratify
            or to instruct the good people of Westmoreland county. My boys and I have driven more
            than 160 miles from our home rather for the purpose of learning what Westmoreland county
            is, and what has been done by your ancestors both for you and for us, than for the
            purpose of adding to your knowledge of history or of the men who made history, or of
            increasing the pride and in- tensifying the interest which you must have in the
            historical associations which crowd around this locality and this oc- casion. (At this
            point the music of a brass band almost drowned the speaker's voice, and he laughingly
            exclaimed : "There is too much of this thing; I never could blow against a brass band."
            The crowd joined in a hearty laugh and General Coulter leaning far over the railing
            toward the unruly musicians shouted : " Are there not enough good people out there to
            stop that band ?" But the band played on. The crowd still seemed to enjoy it. Gen.
            Beaver after waiting a minute turned to those in the im- mediate neighborhood and said :
            '' Coulter forgets that he is not commanding a brigade ; there was a time when he could
            say to a brass band, stop, and it stopped ; play, and it played ; but that time has gone
            by, my old friend, the brass band is on top." Renewed laughter.) Order being finally
            restored the speaker continued : Coming from our home in Bellefonte south of Bedford,
            and then turning westward, we endeavored to follow the old military road that was laid
            out for General Forbes by Colonel Bouquet (or rather by Col. Burd under Bouquet's
            supervision), to Ligonier which was afterwards extended by Washington to Fort Pitt. We
            were unable to follow its im- mediate route altogether, inasmuch as it has been replaced
            by roads with better grades which cross it ; but following 24 The Bouquet Celebration.
            the same general direction we gathered enough to see, and in some measure to understand
            how the men who established our civilization were compelled to toil and to march, and to
            suffer in order that we might enjoy the civilization and the advantages which we have
            to-day. It is a wonderful inspiration for a Pennsylvanian who has some knowledge of the
            history of this general locality to come over these moun- tains, and recall as he
            crosses them how much our fathers labored and suffered and wrought out in toil and blood
            in order that they might hand over to us the great heritage of civilization and of
            freedom which we enjoy, and which we are bound to preserve and hand over to our children
            and children's children. I have lately re-read some of the history which relates to the
            expedition under the command of Col. Bouquet, which left Bedford with the design and for
            the purpose of relieving the beleaguered garrison at Fort Pitt. It is a wonderful story,
            full of romance and daring, but I do not propose to go into its historical details. All
            who are here have doubtless heard of the gallant commander of the expedition. Col. Henry
            Bouquet. He was a man of the most wonderful versatility and varied acquirements and of
            undaunted bravery, and yet, of such wisdom and gentleness that he was enabled to secure
            the co-operation of the people of the eastern part of the State, who, it must be
            confessed, were at that time a little ''twisty " and unwilling to give th^-t cordial
            help and co-operation in military campaigns that were absolutely necessary to secure the
            full fruits of vic- tory. Bouquet, by his wisdom and gentleness quite won the admiration
            of our Quaker population in the eastern part of the State, and succeeded in procuring
            with their ap- parent sanction the necessary votes of supplies and men which enabled him
            to make his subsequent 1764 campaign, which brought permanent peace to the frontier
            settlers until the war of Revolution began. This is not the time nor the place, nor does
            it fall to my province to recount the details of the campaigns of which the battle of
            Bushy Run was a part, nor yet to sketch the life and character of the gallant commander
            who displayed such heroic bravery and wise in- telligence in making the dispositions of
            his forces, which enabled him to win immediate victory upon the field which Address of
            Gen. James A. Beaver. 25 is in our sight. There are certain practical questions which
            grow out of this event which, it seems to me, press upon our attention, and should
            receive our careful consideration. Go to yonder hill-top and picture if you can how this
            wise, brave Swiss Colonel protected his 340 pack-horses and their drivers (for those of
            you who had experience in the army will readily understand that the drivers were harder
            to manage than the horses), and surrounded on all sides by hordes of savages, who were
            confident of the scalps and supplies of the little army which they had surrounded, not
            only saved his transportation and supplies, but by skillfull manoeuvring and brave
            fighting after a two days' battle drove the savages from their well chosen position, and
            fin- ally gained the object of his expedition. No stretch of our imagination can picture
            to us the kind of warfare which was carried on to protect our fathers against the savage
            hordes who were trying their utmost to blot out the little spark of civilization which
            was lighted in this Western region, and which the early settlers were than trying to fan
            into a flame. Those of us who have some knowledge of modern warfare and some experience
            in the late war so happily ended, can scarcely conceive of the situation in which this
            little army of Bouquet was placed. You remember, my comrades, that if we did not have
            about three days' rations in our haversacks, and fully five days more in the wagon
            train, and if we did not have further, a railroad or a river by which to bring up our
            sup- plies, and a telegraph line to keep us in communication with the outside world, we
            were supposed to be in danger of being cut off and "gobbled up." But here is a man with
            less than a thousand men ; aye, with less than half of that number, who struck out from
            Bedford across the moun- tains by a road which had been constructed some five years
            before, who left his wagon train at Fort Ligonier and started thence with all his
            supplies upon pack-horses with his rangers, his Royal Americans, his Highlanders and his
            Light Infantry through the wilderness to relieve the beleaguered fort at the junction of
            the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers. The mode of warfare is so thoroughly foreign to
            our present conceptions of military operations that no stretch of the ^^"" ?>. 26 The
            Bouquet Celebration. imagination, I say, can enable us to comprehend what was involved
            in the campaign to which we have referred, and which was carried to such a successful
            issue by Col. Bouquet. My admiration for the man, however, has led me to wander, and I
            come back to the practical thought which I wish especially to present, which is this :
            that as the men whom we have in mind to-day lived and labored, and some of them laid
            down their lives for us and for what we hold most dear to us, so we are to see to it not
            only that what was left us should be preserved and handed down to our children, but that
            their memories should be perpetuated in an endur- ing way, so that our children and our
            children's children may learn what was done on these hills, before the remem- brance of
            it has faded out of the minds of men and locali- ties can no longer be clearly
            designated. We, in Pennsylva- nia have less of local pride and of interest in our local
            history than have the people either of New England or New York \ as a consequence, many
            localities full of historical and romantic interest are unmarked and comparatively
            unknown. We have in this State a society known as the Historical Society of
            Pennsylvania, whose headquarters are in Phila- delphia. It is doing a vast amount of
            good in preserving the early records of our settlers, and publishing them through the
            medium of the Pennsylvania Magazine. This society, however, is unfortunately largely
            local in its agencies and ends, and therefore local in its results. Its aim is to reach
            out through the entire State and to enlist the interest and co-operation of men in every
            section. Unfortunately, however, it has been unable so far to do this as fully as we
            could wish. Although I live east of the Allegheny moun- tains, we, of that locality are
            classed and have come to consider ourselves as belonging to Western Pennsylvania. It
            would be much better if we could co-operate with the society of which I have spoken, but
            if this cannot be done, we should undoubtedly seek to co-operate with a similar society
            which has been organized in Pittsburg for the bene- fit of that locality and, I take it,
            for that of all Western Pennsylvania. Through one or the other of these agencies not
            only should what has been written with reference to this battle be preserved, but the
            relics which remain of it and Address of Gen. James A. Beaver 27 everything which
            relates to it should be gathered and de- posited under their auspices. Here is a bayonet
            ; it formed a part of the equipment of one of the Highlanders, doubtless, before whose
            terrific bayonet charge the Indian gave way. It should be placed where it would become
            an object lesson to all beholders of the fight at Bushy Run and should stimulate inquiry
            in re- gard to that battle and those who took part in it. Local historical societies in
            connection with either one -or the other of the greater societies already named, should
            be or- ganized in our several localities so as to co-operate with them and secure for
            them just such relics as I have mentioned. The place where the battle was fought should
            be so marked that coming generations would have no difficulty in telling where it is and
            learn through its monuments of the heroism of those who won its great victory. Monuments
            which would serve tell not only where the battle was fought and the victory won, but who
            fell in the fight, and who they were and what they did in winning it. We are brought
            face to face to-day with this bit of colonial history. We learn more than we have ever
            known perhaps of Col. Bouquet and his little army — of their bravery and of his wisdom
            and courage ; and yet he has largely dropped out of Ameri- can history as it is learned
            by the masses of this generation. Over these hill-tops his "name ought to be
            perpetuated. Through the influence of this day the memory of his achievements should be
            revived ; and their influence in shaping the welfare of this region gratefully recalled.
            One of the boasts of my lineage is that I am mainly of Penn- sylvania German stock.
            There is good reason perhaps,, why the memory of Col. Bouquet and his followers is so
            little regarded. Following his campaigns, came the excit- ing events which culminated in
            the war of the Revolution. That, of course, to us Americans was the great event in our
            history. Our interest centres in that; and our American historians are more interested
            in preserving the names of the men who participated in it, than those brave spirits who
            served the mother country in the Indian wars which pre- ceded it. Thi,s perhaps, is the
            reason why the memory of Washington, St. Clair and Mad Anthony Wayne over- 28 The
            Bouquet Celebration. shadows, and their achievements overtop, and to a great extent blot
            out the memory and achievements of this brave German-Swiss. We have a history of which
            we need not be ashamed. Let us be interested in preserving it and making it known to the
            world and to our descendants. We owe it to those who made the history ; we owe it to
            our- selves ; we owe it to those who are to come after us. Let us therefore co-operate
            with Judge Parke and Mr. Bigham and the other gentlemen who have come here from Pitts-
            burg and are interested in preserving the historical records of this region of Western
            Pennsylvania. It is a great pleasure, I assure you, to join with you in the
            commemoration of this great event. I see not only West- moreland, but Armstrong,
            Allegheny, Fayette and other counties represented on these grounds. Such gatherings are
            good, not only because they remind us of what others have done and suffered, but because
            of the social features which surround them, and other opportunities thus afforded for
            renewing old friendships and making new ones. Grate- fully mindful of the men and the
            achievements of the past, true to obligations of the present and trustful as to the
            future, let us gather up the lessons of to-day, and carry them with us as an inspiration
            and an incentive in the life- which we are to live for the benefit not of ourselves
            alone, but of those who are about us and are to come after us. At the close and also
            frequently during the progress of his speech, the sentiments of General Beaver were
            greeted witlj hearty applause. Hon. John E. Parke, of Pittsburg, president of the

            29 ADDRESS OF JUDGE JOHN E. PARKE.* PONTIAC'S PLOT. We have been called together this
            day to celebrate one of the most important and interesting events connected with the
            history of our country. On this spot, sacred to the memory of the past, one hundred and
            twenty years ago, the gallant and accomplished Col. Henry Bouquet, with his heroic
            little band of Highlanders and Anglo-Americans, having passed the rugged and dangerous
            defiles of the Alle- gheny, arrived at Bushy Run, August 5, 1763. The prominent events
            connected with Bouquet's expedi- tion, and their subsequent development into permanent
            set- tlements, the ingredients of which are of the highest import- ance in perpetuating
            the fame of these gallant men, who left the confines of civilization to brave the
            dangers of an unknown country, the simple outline of which, when drawn with fidelity,
            possess marvelous interest to the student of nature. The elaboration of these events I
            will leave to others more competent to do justice to the subject. The imagination fails
            to conceive incidents more roman- tic, than those which sober truth reveals in the
            career of those who penetrated the Western wilds in order to create new homes for
            themselves and families, impelled by those powerful motives of human action — ambition
            and a love of liberty. In the career of many of the early adventurers, we see these
            passions overruling all others. They stand out in bold relief as grand heroes worthy of
            a representation in the an- nals of the country. In the delineation of their deeds, and
            of those who follow after them, who occupied what they had won, by faith, courage and
            indomitable perseverance, are prominent features in the picture. These were the nec-
            essary elements of success in the wide and dangerous fields of adventure, and were ever
            present in great abundance when required in laying the foundation of their future homes.
            ♦Judge Parke had engaged to secure the attendance of W. D. Moore, Esq., of Pittsburg,
            but that gentleman was unable to fulfill the engagement, and up- on a few hours' notice,
            the Judge was obliged to prepare nimself to fill his place. 30 The Bouquet Celebration.
            Many of the events which have rendered Western Penn- sylvania conspicuous in the history
            of the past, leave their impress on the mind of every American citizen. They pass before
            us as a mighty vision, making us feel the poverty of language and weakness of eloquence
            when startling realities are to be described. Old Westmoreland, whose vast territory at
            an early day extended so as to embace nearly all the territory lying west- ward from the
            foot hills of the Alleghenies to the Virginia borders, may be justly styled the Mother
            of the Western Counties, and her soil was among the first points selected by the hardy
            pioneer and venturesome scout to commence the work of civilization. Here all the
            embarrassments of a new settlement were en- countered. The terrible conflicts with the
            cruel and treach- erous red men, isolation from society, cut off from aid and
            intercourse with the Atlantic seaboard, were evils of no or- dinary magnitude. The
            rugged passes of the Alleghenies then presented a formidable barrier, and the traveler
            who passed them, found himself, as it were, in a new world, where he was compelled to
            defend himself or perish. A continual conflict was waged between the sturdy pioneer and
            his implacable In- dian foeman. These conflicts were for life and all that made life
            dear, and were, however, only marked individual acts of heroism, which produced none of
            those events affecting national greatness, which it is the province of the historian to
            record. They will, therefore, find no place in the an- nals of our country, yet it is to
            be hoped, nevertheless, that the indomitable reporter will start out in quest of
            tradition- ary lore, who will patiently listen to the reminiscences of hoary-headed men,
            and laboriously glean the frail and frag- mentary memorials of other days. Then will the
            hardy pioneer and gallant conqueror of the country, of which we are so proud, find a
            place, if not with heroes of history, at least with heroes of romance. The early
            exploration of Westmoreland county by these avant couriers of civilization, of which
            there is no authentic record, are well calculated to excite an interest in the breast
            Address of Judge John E. Parke. 31 of every American citizen, especially those to the **
            manor born." We can scarcely realize the wondrous changes that have occurred in our
            midst, even within the compass of our own recollection. Before the introduction of
            steamboats, or street railways were invented, ere the lightning telegraph and telephone
            had annihilated space, or the steam horse ren- dered distance a myth, a long time ago,
            to the Indian war- whoop and the midnight howl of the wolf, to the light of burning
            cabins, now succeed the sound of the steam whistle, the light of glowing furnaces, the
            sound of the ponderous engine, clang of machinery, and the whirr and clatter of the
            shuttle and cotton spindle. Over this territory, hallowed by the memory of the past, the
            merciless red man roamed, and who claimed the country from the foothills of the
            Alleghenies to the great lakes of the North, over which he ruled, bidding defiance to
            his in- domitable Anglo-Saxon foe. The startling war-whoop, and the no less appalling
            cry of the panther, struck terror into the hearts of all who had the temerity to venture
            within the depths of the gloomy for- ests. Westward through the wilderness led the great
            Indian trail to the mouth of the Beaver ; thence in a northwesterly direction to
            Sandusky and Detroit ; following the ridges, it passed through Trumbull and Portage
            counties, Ohio, clear- ly defined by stone-piles and marked trees. Near the con- fluence
            of the Mahoning and Shenango, forming the Bea- ver, another trail crossed, following a
            more westerly direc- tion to the Tuscarawas branch of the Muskingum. Over these trails
            these wild denizens made their periodical raids, unchecked, towards the settlements,
            except when opposed by the avant couriers of civilization, the venturesome pioneer and
            brave and hardy scout. Notwithstanding the important treaties that had been made with
            them from time to time, they still continued their atrocities upon the de- fenseless
            pioneer, who had the hardihood to brave the dan- ger consequent upon the settlement of
            an unknown coun- try. The memorable struggles between the legions of France 32 The
            Bouquet Celebration. and the battalions of England for the supremacy in the great
            Northwest, during which time the gorgeous Fleur de Lis and the royal banner of St.
            George waved successively over the battlements of old Fort Duquesne, was happily de-
            termined by the peace of 1763. Negotiations with this view were entered into during the
            year 1762, and were finally consummated early in the following year. By the condition of
            the treaty, France agreed to surrender absolutely all her possessions in North America
            to England. Anticipating an early peace, the former made a secret covenant with Spain,
            ceding to that nation the territoi'y of Louisiana, (in the year 1800 it was re-ceded to
            France, and in 1803 was purchased by the United States for ^15,000,000), which at the
            time embraced a large portion of the Southwest. The object of this secret covenant was
            evidently to keep from under the control of their hereditary enemy, the free navigation
            of waters flowing through the Mississippi and Ohio Valleys within the ceded territory.
            This deception was not appar- ent during the negotiation ; it was only made so at the
            time of the execution of the treaty. This covert disposition of the territory, which
            they failed to maintain by the prestige of arms, was a diplomatic trick, seriously
            involving their national honor, and which came near defeating the object. In view of the
            prostration of the country by the recent war, England resolved to accept the situation,
            trusting in their ability to acquire in the future the peaceful possession of the
            disputed territory. With the restoration of peace, it was confidently hoped that it
            would forever end the troubles and difficulties with the Indians, who were, with a few
            exceptions, the allies of France. This, however, was a fatal mistake, as it proved the
            prelude to a most cruel and devastating war, destructive alike to life and property
            throughout the entire Western frontier. The contemplated and simultaneous uprising of
            the several hostile tribes was so unexpected that the out- posts were in a great measure
            unprepared to repel success- fully, their murderous onslaughts, except in the instance
            of the attack on Fort Pitt, Detroit and Ligonier. Hitherto the Indians who had been held
            in subjection by the French had been won over by a doubtful diplomacy Address of Judge
            John E. Parke. 33 and apparent kindness, so that the relations existing be- tween them
            were of the most friendly character. When, however, they discovered that they were to be
            handed over under the treaty to their foe, they indignantly refused to consent thereto.
            The onward and steady pro- gress of civilization carried forward by the indomitable
            Anglo-Saxon race, assured them that submission on their part would end in extermination
            ; to prevent such a calamity, then was the time to act, while the forts were feeble and
            wide apart, and the settlements scattered and thinly popu- lated. The war familarily
            known as the Pontiac war, so called because this great war chief was the genius who
            devised and inaugurated it, and who carried it on with that relentness, cruelty so
            characteristic of the North American Indian. Pontiac' s personal efforts, however, were
            confined chiefly to the neighborhood around Detroit and the lakes, while the operations
            on the borders of the Ohio were entrusted to warriors equally fierce and unrelenting. As
            far as the English and Colonists were concerned, the contests were principally confined
            to Forts Pitt, Detroit and Ligonier. All the frontier forts, except those three and
            Niagara, fell without an effort at defense, the latter was con- sidered too well
            fortified to be molested, so that the three former were the only ones that successfully
            resisted the ad- vancing tide of savage vengeance ; whilst there was nothing left of the
            unfortunate garrisons and the settlements around them but a mass of smouldering ruins.
            Immured within the gloomy depths of a mighty wilderness, isolated from all intercourse
            with civilization, these gallant defenders not only maintainted their posts, but
            actually carried the war into the heart of the enemy's country, and, at the point of the
            bayonet, wrung from them an unwilling peace. The movements, therefore, on these three
            forts, and the ex- pedition that subsequently went out from them against the savages,
            comprises the entire history of the wars as far as it relates to our own military
            movements. The sparse and scattered locations of our frontier defenses through the vast
            wilderness lying between the great Northern lakes and the Ohio and Misissippi Valleys,
            were but rude log enclosures, 2^ 34 The Bouquet Celebration. principally located on the
            lines of water communications, but frequently met with in the heart of the forests, gar-
            risoned by a mere handful of soldiers, and the emblem of sovereignty floating above
            them, seemed more of burlesque than the distinguishing mark of a mighty and powerful na-
            tion. These forts, situated so distant from each other, were but mere dots in the
            interminable wilderness. The presence and maintenance of these isolated outposts
            inflamed the spirits of the haughty chiefs, who had the saga- city to believe that if
            the struggle for the supremacy was maintained and accomplished by their foes, it would
            be the foreshadowing of the red man's coming fate. To resist this encroachment on their
            rights, the head chiefs of the various tribes who inhabited the country, then only known
            and travelled by their own hunting and war parties, determined to crush out at once the
            power of their foes. The Shawnees, Delawares, Senecas, Wyandots and Mi- amis, who
            considered themselves the exclusive masters of the territory, being moved by their
            hatred and fear of their Anglo-Saxon foemen, joined together in a common cause, in order
            to wipe out at once, by a simultaneous movement, the further progress of civilization.
            Although rumors of this confederation occasionally reached the military authorities,
            they did not wholly ignore them, but rather treated them with a cool indifference,
            highly discreditable to their military education, for if prompt measures had been
            carried out on the first intimation of alarm, the sacrifice of life and the destruction
            of the out- posts might have been prevented. It was in consequence of this fatal
            indifference that when the storm burst upon the forts and defenseless settlements, it
            came like the mighty tornado, carrying terror and destruc- tion as it sweeps its
            irresistible course. The period of time selected by the tribe to carry into ef- fect
            their purposes, evinced their profound knowledge and sagacity. Operations were delayed
            until the harvests were safely garnered, so that their foes with the provisions pro-
            vided for their sustenance, might be destroyed at the same Address of Judge John E.

            stratagem, and their gar- risons were cruelly massacred ; others capitulated and shared
            the same fate ; out of all, only one, LaBceuf escaped. The defense of the latter proved
            futile, the Indians having suc- ceeded in firing the adjacent buildings. The garrison
            took refuge in the woods, and ultimately escaped. The royal banner of St. George,
            wherever it floated over mountain, prairie and stream within these vast domains, was
            stricken down. Forts Pitt, Niagara, Ligonier and Detroit still remained intact, and the
            hardy settlers who had escaped the murderous tomahawk and scalping-knife, fled for
            safety within their protecting walls. The intrepid trapper and ven- turesome trader were
            followed up with untiring zeal, arid when taken, were horribly tortured and ruthlessly
            butchered in cold blood, in a manner only known and practiced by these human
            sleuth-hounds. The stout pioneer in the clearng, and the loved ones in the log cabin,
            fell alike before the rifle and tomahawk. The sound of the woodman's axe and the boom of
            the morning and evening gun of the lonely forts went down in silence together, and the
            fires of civilization and the smoke thereof, as it gracefully ascended above the tree
            tops, were ex tinguished in blood. Those who escaped the murderous raid left their rude
            homes to the torch of the foe, and sought safety in flight, carrying with them a tale of
            blood and cruelty, the bare recital of which filled the border set- tlements with terror
            and dismay. In the midst of these scenes of gloom and desolation, the indomitable
            defenders of Forts Pitt, Detroit and Ligonier watched with vigilance the move- ments of
            their treacherous assailants, thus assuring the safety of the forts, their flags
            gallantly spread to the breeze, the only emblems of Anglo-Saxon power and of
            civilization in a land now covered with teeming cities, girdled by the wires of the
            electric telegraph, and traversed by a mighty network of railroads. 36 The Bouquet
            Celebration. Judge Parke was followed by Hon. T. J. Bigham, of Pittsburg, who spoke as
            follows : ADDRESS OF HON. T. J. BIGHAM. I have attended, I believe, all the historical
            celebrations in Westmoreland county of late years. Some years ago I attended the
            celebration at Greensburg, and I was at Han- nastown one year ago. I am not in good
            health. My wife let me come here on condition that I would not make a speech. I am a
            native of this county, having been born at the other end of the manor. I was born and
            lived there until I went to college. My ancestors settled there about two years after
            this battle at Bushy Run. We did not cele- brate the one hundreth anniversary of this
            battle, as the battle of Gettysburg occurred just about that time. At the time of the
            Bushy Run battle this county was in Cumberland — -the capital was Carlisle. At one time
            it in- cluded nearly the whole of Western Pennsylvania. This was all called Mother
            Cumberland, just after the battle of Bushy Run. I am in favor of preserving the records
            of the early history of Westmoreland. I am seventy-four years old and have been, next to
            Judge Parke, the most busily en- gaged in the old historical celebrations. There was one
            or two battles in Fayette county, by Washington, and one in Armstrong. Col. Armstrong
            led all Pennsylvanians to Kittanning, and destroyed that nest of Indians. I always like
            to attend these meetings if I am able to get out at all. The old Residenter's Society of
            Pittsburg is designed to imitate the Historical Society of Pennsylvania. Judge Parke
            wishes to enlarge this society. Most people have lost a knowledge of the French and
            Indian war. A reporter came up to me and asked me about this war. I said ^' Is it
            possible that the young generation don't know anything about this war?" France claimed
            to have discovered the mouth of the Mississippi river, also the St. Lawrence. It was
            then a kind of rule that the nation that discovered the mouth of the river had the right
            to the territory which it drained. France claimed every foot of ground that she thought
            was hers, and named it New France. Louis XIV., in the estimation of the French, was a
            grand Address of Hon. T. J. Bigham. 37 monarch, and he claimed all the country west of
            the Mis- sissippi and Ohio. Louis XXV entertained the same idea. The English had settled
            east of the Allegheny mountains. The English charter included all the country from ocean
            to ocean. We passed through the country where Braddock was defeated in July, 1755, this
            morning. In 1758 William Pitt, after whom Pittsburg is named, was called to the helm of
            the British Empire. He was the greatest statesman of the last century; no European
            statesman excelled him. Before this time the armies in America had bad leaders. Pitt
            sent good men to take command. Wolfe and Forbes were sent over to fight the French and
            Indians. The war continued some seven or eight months and was ended just before the
            battle of Bushy Run. Great Britain never was so powerful as she was at that time. The
            whole of this country east of the Mississippi was owned by her. In India war was carried
            on, and the whole of that country, with a population greater than the United States
            to-day, was ceded to England. She was never so great a nation as at that time, not even
            after the battle of Waterloo, where the whole of Europe was repulsed. Our interests were
            with Great Britain, and I think if England had not succeeded in the French and Indian
            war we would not be as far on in indus- try and civilization as we are at the present
            time. Pontiac is said to have led part of the force which de- feated Braddock. He
            summoned his men and made a great speech, in which he told them that the Great Spirit
            had come to them and they resolved that they would destroy our an- cestors. The tempest
            broke out in June. Guyasootha was the commander of the party which attacked this place.
            He was the principal man that led the warriors under Pontiac. Pontiac himself was
            besieging Detroit. It is not known definitely that Guyasootha was the commander in the
            battle, but it is highly probable he was here. I rejoice that Bouquet was successful.
            They attempted to play the same trick on Bouquet as they did on Braddock, but he turned
            the tables on them. They fought the whole afternoon of the fifth, night parted them and
            they fought the battle again the next day. This place was a sort of half-way station
            between Ligonier and Fort Pitt. He intended to rest his men at Bushy Run 38 The Bouquet
            Celebration. and march through the wilderness near Turtle Creek at night, where he
            expected to meet the Indians. At this battle he managed his men in two files. He then
            sent for- ward two companies to make the attack, but this was a failure. The Indians
            supposed this to be a real retreat, and got out from the woods and then had to fight
            Bouquet's men on both sides. That was just the reverse of the position in which Braddock
            was. The Indians in the woods were formidable, but out of them the white man could get
            the best of them. Bouquet just re-acted Braddock's Field, but got the Indians into the
            trap. After they were driven back they fled away to the Muskingum country. Some time ago
            some young lawyers came in my office, and I asked them if they knew who Bouquet was ? My
            son spoke up and said that he was a Frenchman. I request that the people of Harrison
            City petition the Court to change the name of Harrison City to that of Bou- quet. It
            would mean something to have Bouquet City in- stead of Harrison City. From infancy I
            heard talk of the burning of Hannastown. Braddock forbid his men to get behind trees but
            made them keep in regular order, and in this way the Indians had the advantage. Bouquet
            made another tour in 1764 into the Muskingum country to effect a treaty with the Indians
            in which he was successful. In 1 765 he was sent to Florida. He contracted a fever there
            and died. In 1762 all the country east of the Mississippi was ceded to the English.
            Pontiac did not hate the French as much as he did the English, for he knew they would
            not harm so much in the way of making settlements and in cultivat- ing land. The
            Anglo-Saxons were industrious. My an- cestors were Irish. If the French were industrious
            they could have found plenty to do in the Mississippi valley. THE CONCLUSION. When Judge
            Bigham's speech was ended the benediction was pronounced by Rev. D. B. Lady, of Manor,
            and the Review of the Grand Army Posts. 39 literary exercises of the day were brought to
            a close between three and four o'clock in the afternoon. Letters were received from
            distinguished gentlemen of our own and other lands, some of which are hereto appended.
            REVIEW OF THE GRAND ARMY POSTS. While Gen. R. Coulter was presiding at the speaker's
            stand during the delivery of the last two addresses, Gen. James A. Beaver, Gen. Thomas
            F. Gallagher, Col. John Johnston and other military men reviewed the Grand Army Posts on
            the top of Gongaware's Hill, the scene of the first day's fight between the Indians and
            the two companies of Highlanders and where a large number of Bouquet's men were buried
            at the close of the battle. G. A. R. Post, No. 4, of Latrobe, arrived in the grove on
            Sunday evening and encamped there during the night. On Monday they were joined by two
            brass bands from that place and others of their comrades until their number reached
            about 50. Irwin Post, (190) mustering 75 men and headed by the Paintertown cornet band,
            and Turtle Creek Post, (199) with 25 men and a martial band, arrived early in the day.
            Later the Greensburg Post, with 40 members and a martial band, and Fort Ligonier Post,
            with 40 members and a brass band, reached the grove. Still later the Sewickley Cavalry,
            commanded by Capt. Samuel Bell and Lieuts. Millken, Martin and McCune, 70 strong, and
            headed by a martial band, rode up to the rendezvous of rejoicing. There were other
            members of Posts in neighboring towns and counties in attendance, but not as
            organizations. The excellent Salem cornet band and Citi- zens' band of Greensburg were
            likewise present and added their harmonious strains to the almost ceaseless flow of
            music during the day. Headed by the Citizens' band, of Greensburg, the battle- scarred
            veterans to the number of about 300 with their respective bands, made a few evolutions
            around' the hill-top and then marched past the Generals in fine style. They were
            followed by the Cavalry in picturesque costumes. The distinguished reviewers expressed
            themselves highly gratified with the military display. 40 The Bouquet Celebration,
            Shortly before the review began Rev. C. Cort introduced Revs. A. E. Truxal, John W.
            Love, Geo. H. Johnston, Thos. J. Barkley and A. B. KHne to Generals Beaver and
            Gallagher. As soon as the introduction was ended Gen. Beaver remarked: ''Gentlemen, I am
            very glad to see you here and I appoint you all to act as members of my staff. ' '
            Several of the clergy received orders immediately to clear the space in front of the
            General and his party so that the veterans could' pass muster without being crowded.
            This was no easy task under the circumstances. Col. Oursler, of Latrobe, and others
            deserve great credit for securing the presence of so many G. A. R. men. Herewith we
            append some of the letters received by those in charge of the celebration. LETTERS FROM
            PUBLIC OFFICIALS, etC. Philadelphia, Aug. 2, 1883. To the Honorable Committee on
            Invitation for the Bouquet Celebration : Gentlemen : Your kind invitation to participate
            in the celebration of the battle of Bushy Run, in honor of my distinguished countryman,
            Gen. Henry Bouquet, on the 6th instant, has come to hand in time. Please accept my
            sincere thanks for the same and believe me, it would afford me great pleasure, to meet
            you on such an occasion of intense gratification to my patriotic feelings. To see the
            history of another of my compatriots, who devoted his life and gallant services to the
            exist- ence and security of this land of freedom in its early stages, — a republi- can
            by birth and spirit, instrumental in the early struggles of this great Republic, — drawn
            from oblivion and placed in its well deserved posi- tion before the people, cannot but
            fill my heart with pride for the hero of your celebration and with warmest thanks for
            the gentlemen who have taken in hand this noble task. While I, therefore, deeply regret
            to be prevented, by my arduous duties from accepting your kind and honor- ing
            invitation, I thank you gentlemen, all of you, who have the noblest interest, started
            and brought to a happy issue this timely and creditable celebration, from all my heart.
            I also convey to you my warmest thanks from the countrymen in my consular district and
            especially from the members of the Swiss National Festival Society, in this city, whom I
            have made acquainted with your object, and who, in their last meeting, by resolution,
            unanimously passed, have authorized and requested me to do so. With sincere hope and
            conviction, that your festival may be a great and complete success, I remain, gentlemen,
            very respectfully yours, R. KORADi, Consul of Switzerland. In a personal letter to Rev.
            Cyrus Cort, Herr Koradi Letters from Public Officials ^ et^c. 41 states that he has
            forwarded copies of the former's historical pamphlet to the Prefect at Rolle, the Chief
            of Department of Public Instruction at Lausanna, to the Federal Chancery at Berne and to
            the Swiss Legation at Washington. Executive Mansion, Washington, July 12, 1883. My Dear
            Sir : The President desires me to acknowledge the re- ceipt of your kind note of the 7th
            inst., inviting him to be present at the celebration of Bushy Run, on the 6th of August

            accep- tance. Thanking you in his behalf for the courtesy of the invitation, I am, very
            truly yours, O. L. Pruden, Sec'y. R. Coulter, Esq., Ch'm, etc., Greensburg, Penn'a.
            Washington, July 17, 1883. Sir : I much regret that it will not be in my power to accept
            your courteous invitation to be present at the celebration of the 120th an- niversary of

            an invitation to him to be present and par- ticipate in the celebration of the battle of
            Bushy Run, to be held on the battle-field on Monday, August 6th. The Governor is greatly
            obliged for your kind remembrance of him and regrets that engagements already made cover
            the dates named and will prevent his acceptance. Very truly yours, F. D. Mussey, Private

            Coulter, Esq., Chairman : Dear Sir : In reply to your invitation to General Drum to be
            pres- ent at the celebration of the battle of Bushy Run on August 6th, I beg to inform
            you that the General is at present absent on a "tour of inspec- tion," and will not
            return to this city before the date named, otherwise I have no doubt he would take
            pleasure in joining the celebration. Very Respectfully, Henry Turnbull. Letters of
            regret were also read from ex-Governor Hart- ranft ; Mayor King, of Philadelphia \ Hon.
            W. U. Hensel, of Lancaster, and Prof. Samuel Wilson, of Allegheny City. APPENDIX
            IMPORTANT ADDENDA, LETTERS, ETC. In response to enquiries sent by Counsul Koradi,
            through the Prefect of RoUe, to the custodians of the archives of the Canton Vand, at
            Lausanne, in Switzerland, Rev. C. Cort received sonie valuable data from Mr. J. Berney,
            the Chief of Public Instruction for the Canton Vand. This came too late for the Bouquet
            pamphlet, for which it was desired, but we will insert the main points here. In the
            Parochial Register of the Reformed Church of Rolle, the entry is made March 25, 1735,
            that Henry Bou- quet had been examined, along with others, with a view to participate in
            the Holy Communion. His age is stated to be 16 years. This agrees with other data which
            state that Henry Bouquet was born in the year 1719. It is further stated in this
            document of Mr. Berney, that Henry Louis Bouquet was the oldest of seven brothers; that
            he entered the service of Holland, in 1736, and after- wards passed into the service of
            Piedmont, where his bril- liant career and intelligence attracted the Prince of Orange,
            who invited him to command a company of his guard. During the leisure hours of garrison
            duty, he cultivated the sciences and became intimately acquainted with distinguished
            professors in Holland, at the University of Leeyden, etc. From this, it appears that our
            hero had a middle name, which he seldom or never used. Louis Bouquet, evidently the
            uncle referred to in the will of Henry Bouquet (see page 76, of Bouquet pamphlet),
            became General Quartermaster and Lieutenant-Colonel in the Regiment Stuerler, in the
            service of the Netherlands, and renounced his citizenship of Rolle, April 14, 1750, and
            was discharged from his duties as a citizen, October 8, 1750, evidently with a view of
            be- 44 Th^ Bouquet Celebration — Appendix. coming a citizen of Holland, where he had
            risen to distinc- tion. Several members of the Bouquet family served with distinction in
            foreign countries, we are told ; particularly in Holland, where, among others, one of
            his uncles was an engineer officer. This may have been Colonel Louis, al- ready
            described. The Bouquet family were citizens of Rolle, and one of its members belonged to
            the council of that town or city. In the letter, forwarding the document. Consul Koradi
            writes : " Just as I thought, when reading your very interesting pamphlet, in which you
            give such a clear and minute report of my countryman, that I wondered where you got all
            these details from ; the report I got does not bring anything new. The only point of
            irriportance is the proof by it, that Henry Bouquet really was a native of Rolle, a
            Swiss from the Canton of Vand, and that BouquetVas his correct oirginal name ; that,
            therefore, the suggestions of the Pioneer of Cincinnati, that he was a German, and his
            name Frenchified, from Strauss, into Bouquet, was wrong." This was the conclusion
            arrived at, on other grounds, by Rev. Cort (see pamphlet, page 5). The archives of Vand
            also state that \ " In 1754, the British government confided to him and fellow-coun-
            tryman, Haldimand, of Yoerden (also in the Canton of Vand), the or- ganization of a
            brigade, named the Royal American, into which he drew several other fellow-citizens of
            the Canton of Vand, among whom was DuFes, of Monden, and Vullgamott, of Lausanne."
            Subsequent to the publication of the Bouquet pamphlet and the Bushy Run Celebration of
            August 6, 1883, Wm. M. Darlington, Esq., of Pittsburg, Pa., informed Rev. C. Cort that
            he had spent a good deal of time in an effort to ascertain the exact location of
            Bouquet's grave, at Pensa- cola, many years ago. He had an old drawing of the fort and
            barracks at Pensacola, made in 1772, which would seem to locate the grave and monument
            of Bouquet, if the exact position of the old barracks can be determined. Mr. Darlington
            says that one of the principal clerks of the British Museum told him that the Canadian
            government paid a thousand pounds sterling, or five thousand dollars, for a manuscript
            copy of the Bouquet-Haldimand papers, which were presented to the British Museum by a
            grandson of Haldimand. Important Addenda, Letters, et*c. 45 LETTER OF G. D. SCULL. On
            page 83, of the Bouquet pamphlet, reference is made to G. D. Scull, an American resident
            of Oxford, England, who had collated some of the more important Bouquet pa- pers for
            publication, a limited number of which, at ten dol- lars a copy, was to be printed at an
            early date. The following letter from Mr. Scull to Rev. Cort, will be of interest in
            several respects. He had previously written that Bouquet was deserving of perennial
            remembrance, and he was delighted to learn of the proposed celebration at Bushy Run.
            Rugby Lodge, Norham Road, 'J Oxford, Aug. 17, 1883. / Dear Sir :— I am extremely obliged
            to you for the copy (jf " Bou- quet and his Campaigns," received some days ago. I assure
            you, I have read it with great interest and pleasure. Of a certainty you are General
            Bouquet's quaUfied and well-appointed biographer. What a pity that your well directed
            search for his grave, at Pensacola, ended in total failure. Lieut. Francis Hutcheson,in
            1763, was with Bouquet in his expedition against the Ohio Indians, and acted, at times,
            as his secretary. Bouquet invited Hutcheson to go with him to Pensacola, where they
            arrived, and Bouquet was buried eight days after. He was appointed a Major of Brigades
            afterwards. Hutcheson acted as administrator to Bouquet's estate, at Pensacola, had a
            vendue, and brought up North the net bal- ance in bills on London and New York —

            amounts paid six soldiers for carrying the corpse to the grave, $3. Left with Captam
            Valoe to finish railing around the General's grave, ^^30, and ^11.05 for scantling round
            ditto. Among the things put in an inventory, and which were probably handed over to
            Colonel Haldimand, are :- A gold watch, with a seal, coat of arms and compass, a sum of
            coin, Johannes and j^ do., doub- loons, guineas and ]4. do., 2 negro men and i girl, 24

            standpoint, we may smile at the mention of some of the articles in the forego- ing list.
            But Bouquet, like all other men, must be judged by his own times, and the customs of the
            age and country in which he lived. An inventory of the personal eff ects of George
            Washington and other Revolutionary patriots would not differ materially from the one
            given above. The inventory confirms what we know from other data, that Bouquet was a
            generous-hearted host, a good liver and a man of elegant tastes. CELEBRATION ITEMS. Gen.
            James A. Beaver and his three sons arrived in Greensburg on Saturday evening, and
            stopped at the Fisher House until Monday morn- ing, vi^hen they drove to the Bouquet
            battle-ground, where the General took part in the celebration. He was on his way to
            Conneaut Lake, where his brigade will go into encampment at the close of the week.
            Andrew Byerly, of Sharpsville, Mercer county, a great grandson of Andrew Byerly, of
            Bushy Run fame, arrived in Greensburg on Satur- day, on his way to Bushy Run, and was
            the guest of Ex- County Treas- urer James Gregg. — Prof. Andrew Byerly, of Millersville
            Normal School, an establishment of seven or eight hundred students, is also a great
            grandson. Mrs. Rev. Cyrus Cort, two sons — Paul and Ambrose — and cousin, reached this
            place at noon on Saturday, from Greencastle, in a carriage drawn by one horse. They came
            by way of Forts iiedford and Ligo- nier — the same road taken by Col. Bouquet and his
            army when on his way to relieve Fort Pitt. They were three days en route, the distance
            traveled being one hundred and twenty-five miles. They spent one night at Ligonier, the
            site of the fort by that name, where Andrew By- erly, the great-great-great-grandfather
            of Mrs. Cort's sons, was cooped up by Pontiac's confederates, after making a narrow
            escape from Bushy Run, where Byerly kept a relay station for express riders midway be-
            tween Forts Pitts and Ligonier. Mrs. Cort joined her husband at this place, who arrived
            here by rail on Thursday morning last, accompanied by his four-year-old son, Ralph
            Bouquet, to help perfect arrangements for the celebration. A bayonet used by the Royal
            Infantry, and found on the Bushy Run battle-field by C. Gongaware in i88i, and presented
            to Rev. Cyrus Cort, of Greencastle, was on exhibition. It is in a good state of
            preserva- tion. The blade part is sixteen inches long and bears the appearance of having
            been a very formidable instrument of war. OLD BOB, THE WAR HORSE. The celebrated war
            horse upon which Col. George Covode was shot and killed, is here. He is owned by W. H.
            Covode, Esq., of Ligo- nier. He is now 32 years old, and was through the following
            engage- Monument Collections. 47 ments : Gaines Mill, Charles City Cross Roads,
            Hedgeville, Antietam, Markham Station, Kelly's Ford, Middleburg, Gettysburg, Upperville,
            Shepherdstown, TrevilUan Station, Todd's Tavern, Sulphur Springs, Deep Bottom, St.
            Mary's Church, Ream's Station, Stony Creek, etc. Col. Covode rode Bob around Richmond
            twice, during which he was shot in the neck, the only wound the horse received. That
            intrepid son of Mars, Colonel Rogers, divided the Indian honors with Guito, the Seneca
            youth. The valiant Colonel was gotten up as a great brave in a fearful and wonderful
            costume, with rings, feathers and a great battle-axe as ornaments. To attempt a
            description of his outfit would be to essay to " paint the lily." It is enough to say
            that his make-up was purely and typically Rogerian and that he was the ob- served of all
            observers. Captain Samuel Bell, of South Huntingdon township, with a com- pany of 100
            uniformed men on horseback. A delegation of five arrived from Irwin on bicycles. J. V.
            Stephenson, Adison Bamhart, Harry Huffman, Eli Beck, Joseph Guffey and B. J. Johnston
            arrived at 9 o'clock on bicycles. Several amusing incidents occurred while the surveying
            party were engaged in marking the battle-field. John Layton (colored) assisted at the
            work, and his mind was evi- dently quite wrought up by hearing details of the fight. He
            gave vent to his feelings by such exclamations as these : " I tell you what, didn't
            William Penn and his soldiers have a hard time of it here ? What terri- ble sufferings
            our ancestors had to go through," etc. After hearing the story of Kuykyuskung, (pages
            40-42 of Bouquet pamphlet), some of the boys concluded to have a little fun and do some
            marking on their own account. Accordidgly they marked a board as follows, and nailed it
            to a large oak tree by the roadside, and near the scene of Bouquet's final strategic
            movement so disastrous to the savages : " Here one bloody injun, Kookyoosti, was kilt."
            A great crowd sur- rounded that tree on Celebration Day, and many pieces of its bark
            were taken away as relics. The large Swiss national flag with its red field and white
            cross in the centre, presented a fine appearance, as did also the smaller one with its
            gilt fringing. MONUMENT COLLECTIONS. A number of gentlemen were furnished with
            subscription lists to get contributions for the monument proposed to be erected to Col.
            Bouquet and his army on the battle-field. But it seems very little was done for this
            laudable object, except by some of the citizens of Irwin and Stewartsville and vicinity,
            who, besides raising $56 to help defray expenses of the celebra- tion, also gave forty
            dollars ($40) toward the monument fund. This ;^4o with a goodly part of the ^56, were
            given by descendants of Andrew Byerly, of Bushy Run. If 4S The Bouquet Celebralion —
            Appendix. Greensburg, Penn., Harrison City, Manor, and other places would do as well in
            proportion, a granite memorial column would soon crown the summit of the battle-field,
            which would permanently identify the place and perpetuate the memory of the decisive
            conflict and the gallant heroes through all coming time. Several hundred dollars more
            are needed for this monu- ment fund, which we trust the public-spirited citizens of
            Western Pennsylvania will contribute at an early date. A grand work has already been
            accomplished by the celebra- tion of August 6, 1883, and the various publications rela-
            ting to Bouquet which it called forth. But without the monument the projectors and
            advocates and actors in that commemoration feel that the main object of their endeavors
            remains to be realized. This fund is in charge of General Coulter, Amos B. Kline and
            James Gregg, (Treasurer), of Greensburg, to whom contributions ma)' be safely entrusted.
            Furnish them ^300 more, and the monument will be put up, and a grand dedication service
            will bring to a fitting con- clusion the praiseworthy eff"orts to honor the memory of
            Henry Bouquet and the 1763 Army of Deliverance. One way of helping the cause is to
            circulate the pamphlet relating to Bouquet, his campaigns and the celebration of the
            Bushy Run victory. As the Freiheif s Freund, of Pittsburg, stated in one of its issues,
            these pamphlets '' ought to be put into the hands of every school boy and girl in
            Pennsylvania." As a limited number of copies have been printed and the work not
            stereotyped, the time will probably soon come when they will be as rare and expensive as
            Bouquet's origi- nal narrative, a copy of which recently brought upwards of fifty
            dollars. And yet without them no Pennsylvania library can be considered complete. Their
            preparation has been a labor of love on the part of him who has borne the chief burden
            of toil and expense from a sense of gratitude to the noble Swiss hero who rescued his
            ancestors from the toma-. hawk and scalping-knife of the merciless savages. But
            thousands of others in our Keystone Commonwealth, yea, all over this great Republic, are
            also greatly indebted to Henry Bouquet, and should esteem it a duty and privilege to
            help perpetuate the memory of his noble character and his heroic deeds. Guyasutha. 49
            GUYASUTHA. The reputed leader of the savages at Bushy Run battle and the siege of Fort
            Pitt, was Guyasutha, the chief of a band ot Seneca Indians located in Ohio, who, along
            with the Mingoes, belonged to the loquois or famous Six Nations, from Central and
            Western New York. His name is spelled in half a dozen different ways. As a young brave
            he went with Wash- ington from Logstown to LaBoeufin 1754. He was a leading character in
            the conference with Gen. Bradstreet when that conceited officer was hoodwinked by the
            wily savages near Lake Erie in 1764. A few weeks later he had to deal with a different
            style of man in his conference with Col. Bouquet on the Muskingum. His eloquent and
            politic speech on that occasion is given in the Bouquet pamphlet, page 68. ^ In April
            and May, 1768, he was leading actor at a confer- ence at Fort Pitt. When Washington
            descended the Ohio in 1770 Guyasutha visited him and was recognized as one of his
            companions in 1754. In 1775, two days after the Westmoreland patriots had promulgated
            their Declaration of Indpendence, on May 16, at Hannastown and Fort Pitt, Guyasutha, who
            had just re- turned from Niagara, held a conference at Fort Pitt with - Majors Trent and
            Ward and Captain Neville. Capt. Pipe, a Delaware chief, and Shade, a Shawnese chief, and
            several other Shawnese, took part. Guyasutha announced that the Six Nations and their
            allies in Ohio would remain neutral during the impending war between the British and the
            Amer- ican Colonists. He said : " Brothers, we will not suffer either English or
            Americans to pass through our country. Should either attempt it we will forewarn them
            three times, and should they persist they must abide the consequences. I am appointed by
            the Six Nations to take care of this country, that is, of the Indians on the other side
            of the . Ohio, and I desire that you will not think of an expedition against Detroit,
            for, to repeat, we will not suffer an army to pass through our country." In 1782, July
            13, Guyasutha led the attack on Hannas- town. He seems to have been the greatest leader
            of Pon- tiac's Eastern confederates, but had his forces shattered at Bushy Run by
            Bouquet, after the best contested battle ever 50 The Bouquet Celebration — Appendix.
            fought by the red savages on American soil. In view of his prominence, the war is
            sometimes called ''Guyasutha's War," as well as '' Pontiac's War." Finally, he died near
            Pittsburg, at an advanced age, leaving his name to the beautiful plain on the Allegheny
            river, where his remains now rest. Neville B. Craig gives most of the foregoing facts in
            his History of Pittsburg (pages 136-9), and was personally acquainted with Guyasutha,
            when he tarried superfluous on the stage a striking emblem of the decayed condition of
            the Six Nations, as in the prime of life he had been a fit repre- sentative of their
            power and glory. Once the Iroquois car- ried dismay to all the savage tribes between the
            Atlantic and the Father of Waters, and between the Gulf of Mexico and the great Lakes of
            the North. Yea, to French and English alike, in Canada and the United States. They were
            the recognized lords of the savage wilderness, and exacted tribute from the powerful
            Catawbas and Cherokees in the distant South, who traveled along the war-path through the
            wilds of Westmoreland, from year to year, with tokens of obeisance and servitude to the
            great Council House at Onondaga. And thus, like the old Romans, their power and glory,
            founded on rapine, has departed, in spite of all their superior courage, energy and
            governmental genius. CONCLUDING REMARKS. A shade of sadness comes over us as we bring
            this memo- rial volume to a close. A number of public-spirited citi- zens, who took part
            in the celebration, and who were most highly gratified and warmest m their
            congratulations over its success, have passed away since that memorable sixth of August,
            1883. Hon. Joseph H. Kuhns, who seemed to re- new his youth in his efforts to promote
            the commemoration ; General Thomas F. Gallagher, the stalwart hero of Gaines' Mills and
            South Mountain ; Dr. Samuel Wilson, who was stricken down with fatal disease on the eve
            of the celebra- tion, in which he fondly hoped to take part ; ex-Senator Cowan and
            others, distinguished in forum and field, have passed across the river. This is a solemn
            reminder that we, who remain, ''should be up and doing," to finish the work so grandly
            begun. MEMORIAL ENOCH BEOWN AND ELEVEN SCHOLARS. Who Were Massacred in Antrim Township,

            after the French and Indian Wars came the Pontiac War of 1763-4, when the great
            chieftain of the Ottawas marshaled the tribes between the great lakes and the
            Alleghenies into hostile camps against the English and their colonial subjects. His
            avowed purpose was to drive the red coats and pale faces into the sea. No less than ten
            forts between Detroit and Fort Pitt were captured, and most of their garrisons
            massacred. Detroit, Fort Pitt and Ligonier were closely besieged for months by the
            savages. Col. Henry Bouquet with a force of about five hundred men, mostly Scotch
            highlanders, broke the eastern wing of Pontiac's conspiracy by defeating his
            confederates under Guyasutha, etc. , after a desperate two days battle at Edge Hill or
            Bushy Run, Aug. 5 and 6, 1763. The gallant com- mander begged for a few hundred more
            troops with which to penetrate to the haunts of the Indians in central Ohio and thus
            bring the war to a decisive close. But the Quaker provincial authorities disregarded his
            appeals for the much needed reinforcements. As a consequence, prowling bands of savages
            made frequent raids, into the settlements, killing and scalping the pioneer settlers in
            Pennsylvania, Maryland and Virginia regardless of age, sex or condition. In one of these
            forays into the Cumberland Valley on the twenty- sixth day of July, 1 764, there was
            perpetrated, what Park- man, the historian of Colonial times, pronounces *'an out- A 2
            Enoch Brown Memorial, rage unmatched in fiendish atrocity through all the annals of the
            war. ' ' This was the cold-blooded massacre of Enoch Brown, a worthy Christian
            school-master, and eleven scholars, at a little log school-house in Antrim township,
            three miles north of where Green castle now stands. Eight years before to the very day
            (July 26, 1756,) John McCullough, eight years old, and his little brother had been
            carried away captive by five Delaware Indians and a French- man, from their home, a few
            miles southwest of the school house, and at this time John was living as an adopted son,
            among the Delaware Indians on the banks of the Musk- ingum. In his narrative, as
            published in Border Life, etc. , it is stated that the massacre of the school-master and
            scholars was perpetrated by three young warriors from that locality, who brought the
            scalps of master and scholars back as bloody trophies of their trip into the
            settlements. Neep- paugh-weese. Night Walker, an old chief or half king, and other old
            Indians denounced them for killing so many chil- dren and called them cowards, the
            greatest affront that could be offered them. The original MSS. of the McCullough
            narrative, now in the possession of John McCullough, a grandson of the cap- tive lad,
            contains no reference to the massacre, but the family are confident that their ancestor
            furnished the ac- count as given in Border Life, etc. Others have claimed that the
            massacre was perpetrated by a squad of Seneca Indians from western New York. Rich- ard
            Bard in his narrative states that his father was at work near the place of massacre on
            the 26th of July, 1764, and owing to the strange movements of his dog he concluded that
            Indians were skulking in the thicket near by. He re- treated to the house and in about
            an hour saw a party com- manded by Capt. Potter (afterwards Gen. Potter of the
            Revolution) who were in pursuit of a party of Indians, who had on that morning murdered
            a school-master named Brown with ten small children, and had scalped and left for dead
            one by the name of Archibald McCullough, who re- covered. * * According to the story of
            the boy, two old Indians and a young Indian rushed up to the door soon after
            Introductory Sketch. 3 the opening of the morning session. The master, surmising their
            object, prayed them only to take his Hfe and spare the children, but all were brutally
            knocked in the head with an Indian maul and scalped. Some of the traditions repre- sent
            the Indians as shooting the master down when they approached the door, and that on his
            knees he begged them to spare the lives of the little ones. Parkman, in his ^'
            Conspiracy of Pontiac," Vol. 2, says: "■ In the centre lay the master, scalped and
            lifeless, with a Bible clasped in his hand ; while around the room were strewn the
            bodies of his pupils, miserably mangled, though one of them still retained a spark of
            life. The deed was committed by three or four warriors from an Indian village near the
            Ohio." The savage fiends made good their escape, and the horror- stricken settlers
            buried the master and ten scholars in a large box, placed alternately head and feet in
            opposite direc- tions in a common grave a few rods from the scene of slaughter.
            Seventy-nine years afterwards (Aug. 4. 1843) the traditional account of the burial was
            verified by excava- tions made by about twenty citizens of Antrim township, in- cluding
            Geo. W. Ziegler, Esq., Dr. Jas. K. Davison and Gen. David Detrich who still remain with
            us in a hale old age. Christian Koser, the owner of the land, planted four locust trees
            at the corners of the grave ; two of these grew for thirty odd years, when, strange to
            tell, they were cut down for posts. There was danger that the sacred spot would pass
            into oblivion. Col. B. F. Winger, Gen. David Detrich and Rev. Cyrus Cort visited the
            location in the spring of 1883, (April 11), and a month later. May 14, laid the matter
            before a meeting of the citizens of Greencastle, at which Geo. W. Ziegler, Esq.,
            presided. Steps were taken looking to the purchase of the land and the erection of a
            monument, but nothing definite was done until the attention of the Franklin County
            Centennial Convention of April 22, 1884, was called to the subject. This convention,
            composed of representative men from all parts of the county, appointed a committee,
            consisting of Rev. Cyrus Cort, Wm. G. Davison, Col. G. B. Wiestling, 4 Enoch Brown
            Memorial. Dr. A. H. Strickler and Benj. Chambers, to devise plans for raising funds to
            erect a monument, etc. At the afternoon session of the Convention the committee reported
            as follows : Your committee appointed to prepare a proper plan for securing per- manent
            results from the Centennial Celebration in the shape of a Monu- ment to the memory of
            Schoolmaster Enoch Brown and the ten school children massacred by merciless savages,
            July 26th 1764, respectfully re- port the following for the consideration of this
            Convention : Resolved, That the sum of at least two thousand dollars be raised for the
            purpose of securing a suitable amount of land on the farm of Capt. Jacob Diehl, in
            Antrim township, including the spot where Schoolmas- ter Brown and his ten children were
            massacred by the Indians, July 26th, 1764, and where they are now buried; and of
            enclosing the same with a suitable fence and likewise of erecting an appropriate
            monument to their memory and keeping the same in permanent repair. Resolved, That the
            aforesaid fund shall be raised in the name of the teachers and scholars of all the
            schools in the county, including com- mon schools, select schools and Sunday schools.
            Resolved, That all the teachers and scholars of the schools aforesaid be earnestly
            requested to contribute at least one dime each toward the fund on or before Sept. 9,
            1884, and the names of all teachers and scholars so contributing or collecting at least
            one dime shall be record- ed in a suitable book to be preserved in the archives of the
            Historical Society of Franklin County. Resolved, That the committee of the respective
            townships be direct- ed to take immediate steps to have the foregoing school collections
            taken up, either by the teachers at present or lately in charge of the schools, or by
            some suitable person in each school district. Resolved, That in aid of this fund we
            recommend that a collection be taken at all the memorial religious services held on the
            Sunday pre- ceding the Centennial Anniversary, viz : September 7th, 1884. Resolved, That
            in further aid of this fund we recommend that the Executive Centennial Committee be
            directed to request the various rail- roads in the county to contribute a generous
            rebate on all excursion tickets issued on account of the Centennial Celebration.
            Resolved, That a committee of five be appointed to receive the funds and carry into
            effect the action proposed in the foregoing resolution in regard to the purchase of
            land, erection of monument, etc. Resolved, That the above committee be directed to
            request the Court of Franklin County, or other competent authority, to appoint three
            trus- tees to invest not less than five hundred dollars of the funds in securi- ties
            approved by the court, the annual proceeds to be devoted to keep- ing the grounds,
            monument and fences in good condition and repair. Introductory Sketch. 5 Resolved^ That
            the newspapers of the county be earnestly requested to urge the importance of this
            memorial feature of the Centennial upon the attention of the people of Franklin county.
            The report was unanimously adopted by the Convention, and on the motion of Col.
            Wiestling, the committee called for in the seventh resolution was appointed as follows :
            Rev. Cyrus Cort, (chairman) ; Dr. A. H. Strickler (treasurer) ; Hon. D. W. Rowe, Capt.
            R. J. Boyd and Col. W. D. Dixon. On the following day, April 23d, the committee
            contracted with Capt. Diehl, through Col. B. F. Winger, for the en- closed tract or
            field which contains the site of the school house, the grave of Enoch Brown, and
            scholars, together with the spring adjacent. April 29th, the land was surveyed under the
            supervision of Col. Winger, along with Rev. Cort, Dr. Strickler and Col. Dixon of the
            committee. Capt. Diehl obligated him- self in writing to give a deed for the land as
            soon as the surveyor had completed his plot and estimates. The com- mittee pay at the
            rate of twenty-five dollars per acre. The committee bought more land than was at first
            con- templated, for the reason that it was cheaper to purchase the entire field of a
            fraction less than twenty acres at ^^25 per acre, than to buy four or five acres in the
            heart of the field for ^30 per acre, fence it in with a strong and durable fence and
            give bonds to keep the same in good repair for all time to come, which was the
            alternative presented by the owner of the tract. The surplus land can be sold and the
            cost of outside fencing saved, together with the expense and liability of a bond binding
            through all time and necessitating an invest- ment as large as the cost of the entire
            field. A public road has been laid out along the north side of the Enoch Brown Park as
            the tract is now called. It required a great deal of work to reclaim the historic spring
            and clear off the ground between it and the grave. For several weeks during the hottest
            weather the chairman of the committee, assisted by other public spirited citizens,
            ''worked with head, heart, hand and horse ' ' to accomplish this praiseworthy undertak-

            report of the dedication services in the Carlisle Volunteer. The contract for erecting
            the monuments was awarded to Mr. W. N. Meredith, of Mercersburg, for the sum of ;^5oo,
            the committee furnishing the limestone foundations. Hun- dreds have visited the Park
            since dedication day, and have uniformly expressed their gratification with the
            monuments, iron fences and improvements made by the committee with the funds at their
            command. Other items of historic inter- est are omitted here because they appear in the
            addresses. MONUMENT OVER THE COMMON GRAVE OF ENOCH BROWN AND TEN SCHOLARS. THE
            DEDICATION CEREMONIES. THE following account of the dedication ceremonies, organization,
            speeches, etc., we cull in the main from the Greencastle Press of August 6, 1885 :
            UNVEILING AND DEDICATION. August 4, 1885, was indeed the red letter day for Mother
            Antrim. Never before in her history was there such an outpouring of her beauty and
            chivalry to honor and grace a public occasion as that which congregated at Enoch Brown
            Park on Dedication Day. The two previous days had been stormy and foreboding. The long
            wished for rain had deluged the earth in torrents and many feared that the weather would
            be unfavorable for the ceremonies. But there never dawned a lovelier day for the
            occasion than last Tues- day. At an early hour a stream of visitors began to pour out
            over the hills to the Park until about 5,000 people had assembled on the historic field.
            The large monument on the site of the school house, which can be seen from afar, first
            attracted attention, and around it a large con- course of people were soon assembled.
            Then the beati- ful monument of smaller proportions over the common grave of
            Schoolmaster Enoch Brown and ten scholars was next visited, and around it many lingered
            with deep and melancholy interest. Then the historic spring at the foot of the hill, a
            few yards off, drew the multitude, not only to gratify curiosity, but to slake their
            thirst, and thousands there partook of nature's cooling beverage, as did the scholars of
            Enoch Brown one hundred and twenty-one years ago. It was equal to the large demands,
            although one hundred and fifty gallons had been dipped out the previous evening after
            dusk. 8 Enoch Brown Memorial Shortly after ii o'clock Rev. Cyrus Cort arrived with Poet
            Cooper and Historian Egle and daughter in his car- riage, the morning train on which
            they came from Harris- burg having been delayed about half an hour. The meeting was
            called to order by Col. B. F. Winger, Chief Marshal. Mounting the base of the monument
            the Rev. Cort made a few preliminary remarks . and then four little girls and nine boys,
            viz.. Rose Winger, Libbie Sea- crest, Sally Whitmore and Carrie Hawbecker, Paul Cort,
            Paul Sunners, Ambrose Cort, Ambrose Walck, Harry Fuss, Elmer Pentz, George Pentz, George
            Gorden and Willie Meredith, pulled the cords, the mantle of red, white and blue fell and
            the monument stood forth a thing of beauty and strength, the delight of all beholders.
            It is indeed a massive affair. On the top of four feet of solid masonry underneath the
            ground are nearly four feet of dressed lime- stone of immense proportions from
            Hawbecker' s Williamson quarry. On the top of this limestone foundation, which is five
            feet square, is placed the granite base of the monument, four feet square and seventeen
            inches high, and weighing 4,600 pounds. Next comes the polished die or sub-base, three
            feet square and two feet high, on the four sides of which are engraved the inscriptions.
            On the top of this stands the shaft of the monument, two feet square at the base, ten
            feet high and tapering gracefully to a pyramidal apex. The shaft weighs 4,100 pounds.
            Enclosing the monument is a very substantial iron fence, fifteen feet square. The
            follow- ing are the inscriptions : On the East side : Sacred to the Memory of School-
            master Enoch ! Brown and Eleven Scholars, viz: Ruth Hart, Ruth Hale, Eben Taylor, George
            Dunstan, Ar- chie McCULLOUGH, AND SiX OTHERS, (NaMES UN known) WHO WERE MASSACRED AND
            SCALPED BY Indians on this Spot, July 26, 1764, During the Pontiac War. The Dedication
            Ceremonies. On the North side : Erected by Direction of the Franklin Coun- ty Centennial

            the Cause of Education and Christian Civilization. On the South side : The ground is

            The latter are the concluding stanzas of a poem pubhshed last Spring in the town papers
            and in the Guardian, a monthly magazine issued in Philadelphia. The small monument was
            unveiled at the grave by Rev. Cort after a few preliminary remarks. It is a very chaste
            A* lo Enoch Brown Memorial. and pretty structure, composed, like the larger monument, of
            Concord granite. It is about seven feet high and two feet square at the base. On the
            side facing the grave is this inscription, '' The grave of Schoolmaster Enoch Brown and
            Ten Scholars, massacred by the Indians July 26, 1764." Around it is also a solid iron
            fence ten feet square. A heavy stone wall has been erected near the south end of the
            grave and considerable filling has been done. The Mer- cersburg band played a dirge at
            the large monument and the Greencastle and Shady Grove bands at the smaller when the
            unveiling took place. The assemblage then re- paired to the stand erected in the grove
            belonging to the Park, where the remaining ceremonies were conducted ac- cording to the
            published programme. George W. Ziegler, Esq., was chosen President for the day and made
            a short address heartily approving the cause which had brought the people together and
            com- mending the Monument Committee for its faithful and energetic labors. Rev. J. D.
            Hunter then offered a very appropriate prayer. The Reformed church choir, under the lead
            of Prof. Collins assisted by a few amateurs, sang ''America," ''My Country, 'tis of
            Thee," and afterwards the "The Infant Martyrs," a hymn composed by Dr. Henry Harbaugh on
            the martyred babes of Bethlehem who were slain by King Herod. The organization was
            completed by the election of the vice-presidents and secretaries, viz. : Vice
            Presidents, Rev. J. Spangler Kiefer, Hagerstown, Md.; General David Detrich, Dr. James
            K. Davidson, Cap- tain Jacob Deihl, Antrim ; Jacob Hoke, Judge Kimmel, Rev. Herbert,
            Chambersburg ; Jacob B. Brumbaugh, Peters; Simon Lecron, D. C. Shank, George J. Balsley,
            D. O. Nicodemus, Washington ; Joseph Winger, Montgomery ; Dr. Frick, Quincy; Rev.
            Kappenberger, John Hoch, Mer- cersburg ; Rev. Bahner, Waynesboro ; Rev. Riddle, Fairfax,
            Va.; Andrew K. Kissecker, Tiffin, Ohio. Secretaries, W. G. Davison, W. C. Kreps,
            Greencastle ; Bruce Laudebaugh, G. W. Atherton, Mercersburg ; William A. Ried, Antrim ;
            A. N. Pomeroy, Chambersburg. Rev. Cyrus Cort, chairman of the Monument Committee, then
            made the presentation speech, which was well received The Dedication Ceremonies. 1 1 and
            warmly applauded by the audience. The speaker was heartily congratulated from all sides
            at the close. PIC-NIC DINNER. At this point a recess of an hour was taken to partake of
            a pic-nic dinner in the woods. It was an interesting and picturesque sight to see
            families and groups of families enjoying the sumptuous meals which they spread upon the
            leaves and grass or upon improvised tables throughout the beautiful grove. The speakers,
            Witmer, Woods (and lady), Egle (and daughter), and poet Cooper, together with some of
            the clergy, were entertained at one table near the stand by President Ziegler, Marshal
            Winger and Chairman Cort and their families, and seemed to greatly enjoy their dinner
            and the surroundings. A balmy breeze floated among the trees, and nature and Providence
            combined to make the scene one long to be remembered, adding a peculiar zest to the
            spirit of hospitality and good will that pervaded the occasion. AFTERNOON SESSION. After
            dinner the exercises at the stand were resumed. Rev. J. W. Knappenberger, of
            Mercersburg, made a short and very appropriate prayer. Peter A. Witmer, Esq., of
            Hagerstown, Superintendent of Public Schools of Washing- ton county, Md., made an
            eloquent and able address, con- veying the cordial greetings of a sister State and a
            neigh- boring county, endorsing heartily the movement. He said: ''Enoch Brown was a
            nobler hero than the blood- stained warriors or thousands of others who were so often
            honored in this way. The school house was the symbol of our civilization and that brave
            and self-sacrificing man, who was ready to yield his life as a sacrifice for his
            scholars, was a pioneer and a martyr in a blessed cause. He was worthy the high honors
            shown him to-day." Rev. F. M. Woods, of Martinsburg, W. Va. , then delivered an
            excellent speech in fine style. He paid a glowing tribute to the sterling Scotch-Irish
            pioneer settlers, who came to this new world that they might have freedom to worship
            God. They were ready to leave kindred and country and sunder the dearest 12 Enoch Brown
            Memorial, earthly ties for conscience sake. They asked not "Will it pay?" "Will it be
            popular?" but "Is it right?" and, fear- ing God, they had no fear of man. What added
            peculiar interest to Rev. Mr. Wood's remarks is the fact that he is married to a
            daughter of Rev. D. X. Junkin, who is a de- scendant of Eleanor Cochrane. His wife sat
            immediately behind him on the platform, and seemed to enjoy the occa- sion beyond all
            others present, which is saying a great deal. Next came the poem, by John M. Cooper,
            Esq., the gifted bard of Antrim. Like all other productions from Mr. Cooper's pen, it
            was beautiful and classic. It threw a halo of poetic fancy around the memory of the
            martyred schoolmaster and scholars. Finally Dr. Wm. H. Egle, of Harrisburg, Pa.,
            delivered in an effective manner the historial address of the occasion on "Pontiac and
            Bouquet," with especial reference to the part taken by Provincial troops in the campaign
            of 1 763—4. He contrasted these distinguished leaders of the red and white races as the
            representatives of savagery and civiliza- tion, and sketched graphically the leading
            events in the campaigns of 1763-4. He paid a glowing tribute to the memory of Enoch
            Brown (he called him Enoch all the time), the brave, true-hearted schoolmaster, who fell
            with his scholars before the brutality of incarnate fiends. The Doctor evidently has no
            special love for the Indian charac- ter and believes that the uncivilized red man
            illustrates fully the doctrine of total depravity. He paid a very handsome compliment to
            Rev. C. Cort, not only for his persevering and successful efforts in behalf of the Enoch
            Brown Monu- ment, but as the author of an "elegant work" on Bouquet and his campaign of
            1 763-4. At the close Col. Winger moved a vote of thanks to the speakers and poet, and
            that they be requested to furnish copies of their speeches and poem to the Enoch Brown
            Monument Committee for publication. A vote of thanks was also returned to the five bands
            present for their gratuitous services, viz : The bands of Mercersburg, Clay Hill, Shady
            Grove, New Franklin and Greencastle. The benediction was finally pronounced by Rev. John
            R. Agnew, a grandson of Mary Ramsey, one of the scholars The Dedication Ceremonies. 13
            of the Enoch Brown school, who Providentially escaped the massacre. Col. Wiestling was
            to have made the reception speech, but was unable to be present. His substitute failing
            to appear, the following letter was read : Mont Alto, July 29, 1885. Rev. Cyrus Cort^
            Chairman Enoch Brown Monument Committee : My Dear Sir : For several weeks I have had but
            little respite from severe suffering from acute rheumatism following in the wake of a
            sprained knee. This has so disabled me that business matters have accumulated on my
            hands to such an extent as to render it exceedingly improbable that I can ever attend
            the unveiling ceremonies on August 4. Although (as I advised you) I feared this
            contingency, yet I feel sadly disappointed, and deeply regret my inability to celebrate
            with you what I consider an important event. I know it will be interesting ; I know you
            will be happy, because the consciousness of having faithfully fulfilled the trust
            committed to you by the people of Franklin County through their representatives in
            convention, cannot but make you con- gratulate each other as I heartily do you all. Yes,
            I congratulate the citizens of our county on the successful consummation of the crowning
            feature in the programme of the Centennial celebration, so happily woven into history by
            the untiring and effective labors of your com- mittee. The convention made no mistake in
            determining upon the crowning memorial, it did not eir in providing the way to secure
            means for its accomplishment, and it was equally fortunate in selecting a com- mittee of
            ability, industry and unswerving integrity to its commission, a committee, the
            chairmanship of which you have a right to be proud. As compensation for my absence I
            enclose my check for twenty dollars additional contribution to the Monument fund; but
            how I am to be compensated for the loss of my anticipated pleasure in being with you, I
            know not. Very truly yours, Geo. B. Wiestling. The following letter was also read from
            Rev. Prof. Jos. H. Dubbs, D. D., Professor of History, etc., in Franklin and Marshall
            College : Rev. C. Cort: Mr Dear Sir : I regret that it will not be in my power to be
            present at the dedication of the Enoch Brown Monument. It is in my opinion an occasion
            of profound interest, and I hope it may command the gen- eral respect which is
            manifestly deserves. We have in this country but imperfectly learned the lesson that in
            honoring our ancestors we honor ourselves ; but the day will surely come when your
            disinterested labors in this direction will be fully appreciated. I remain fraternally
            yours, Jos. Henry Dubbs. 14 Enoch Brown Memorial. The following letter from Governor
            Pattison and extracts from letters of Horatio Seymour and Thos. G. Apple to Rev. Cort
            were read : FROM THE GOVERNOR. Executive Department, Commonwealth of Penn'a, "» Office
            of the Governor, Harrisburg, July 28, 1885. j B. F. Winger^ Esq., Greencastle, Pa. Sir :
            I am directed by the Governor to acknowledge your very kind invitation to attend the
            ceremonies of the unveiling and dedication of the monument erected to the memory of
            Enoch Brown and his ten scholars who were massacred by Indians one hundred and
            twenty-one years ago, three miles north of Greencastle. The Governor regrets that his
            official engagements which cover the 4th day of August will require his presence at
            Erie, Pa., as President of the commission to establish and maintain a Home of
            Pennsylvania Soldiers and Sailors. For this reason he cannot be present. But he directs
            me to express his sincere gratification that the memory of the pioneer school-master is
            thus to be perpetuated and that the children who with him were stricken down at their
            humble shrine of learning are not forgotten by those who live in the enjoyment of the
            Christian civilization of the present day. I am Very truly yours, Thos. T. Everett,
            Private Secretary. The people then returned to their homes highly gratified with what
            they had seen and heard at the Enoch Brown Park. All were pleased with the monuments,
            the iron fences and other improvements made by the committee. All were delighted with
            the literary exercises. The poet, who is an excellent judge of large experience,
            remarked in the evening " I never heard four better speeches on any public occasion than
            those delivered to-day." He repeatedly announced his intention to bring his entire
            family to Antrim township at an early day to show them the beautiful and lasting monu-
            ments and all the historic scenes belonging to the Enoch Brown Park. He considered it by
            far the grandest day ever seen in Mother Antrim, and said that the crowd around the
            speaker's stand was larger than " he had ever seen listening to a speech of any kind in
            Franklin County. ' ' Many and hearty were the congratulations showered upon the chairman
            of the monument committee at the close of the meeting. He felt amply rewarded for all
            the toil and speech of George W. Ziegler^ Esq. 15 trouble which the monument project has
            given him by the outcome of this red letter day. Chief Marshal Col. B. F. Winger

            SPEECH- OF GEORGE W. ZIEGLER, ESQ., OF GREENCASTLE, PENN'A. George W. Ziegler, on being
            chosen president of the meeting, spoke as follows : Ladies and Gentlemen: — I thank you
            for the honor of the position assigned me as presiding officer of this large and
            respectable meeting on this very interesting and im- portant occasion ; and permit me to
            congratulate you on the bright and glorious sun that greets us from a cloudless sky, to
            cheer and gladden our hearts in the enjoyment of the ceremonies and intellectual feast
            that awaits us. The wooded hillside upon which we are now assembled is sacred and
            historic ground, consecrated and hallowed by the wanton and brutal destruction of human
            life and spill- ing of innocent blood more than a century ago. On the 26th day of July,
            A. D. 1764, a small squad of hostile and treacherous Indians made their appearance upon
            these grounds, and with revenge and murder in their hearts they stealthily stole their
            way to the southeastern declivity of this hill, where then stood an humble pioneer
            school house, occupied by teacher Enoch Brown and eleven of his scholars (thank God the
            number present on that eventful day was not greater), and as soon as it was reached they
            suddenly and fiercely rushed in, and with glaring eyes and 1 6 Enoch Brown Memorial.
            upraised bludgeons in their hands confronted them, and, deaf to the noble appeal of
            humanity on the part of Brown to spare the lives of his scholars, at the sacrifice of
            his own, and their piteous shrieks and cries for mercy, they at once commenced the
            slaughter of master and children, and in cold blood massacred the whole school, save
            little Archie McCullough, whom they supposed dead, but who afterward revived ; and while
            teacher and scholars were still agonizing in the throes and convulsions of death they
            proceeded in the awful and horrible work of securing their scalps, that they might bear
            them back, in their blood-stained hands, as trophies of their victory to the
            bloodthirsty chieftain, who had no doubt detailed them on their revengeful mission of
            destruction and death. This act on the part of the Indians is unquestionably the most
            cowardly, bloody and atrocious tragedy that stains the annals of our border warfare in
            the Cumberland valley, during the dark and bloody days of its Colonial history ; and,
            although more than a hundred years have come and gone since its enactment, yet we cannot
            listen to its recital without a sigh and shudder of sorrow and regret for the sad and
            lamentable fate of its innocent victims. But enough of this awful and horrible story,
            and let us now joyfully turn to its interesting and fitting sequel, which is about to
            reach its culmination in the ceremonies of this day. At a meeting of the Franklin County
            Centennial Con- vention, held in Chambersburg, on the 2 2d day of April, 1884, the Rev.
            Cyrus Cort and Col. George B. Wiestling, and other public spirited gentlemen of the
            convention, in- duced that body to take action for the adoption of certain necessary
            measures for the promotion and consummation of the laudable and commendable movement
            inaugurated at a meeting held by a number of the liberal minded citizens of the borough
            of Greencastle, on the 14th of May, 1883, looking to the erection of a monument, etc., to
            the memory of Enoch Brown and his scholars, massacred on this hill on the 26th of July,
            1764. And to these preliminary movements and the untiring labors of the Centennial,
            County and Monument Commit- speech of George W. Ziegler^ Esq. 1 7 tees, and for the
            faithful, proper and speedy manner in which they prosecuted the work assigned them by
            the FrankHn County Centennial Convention, we stand greatly indebted this day for the two
            beautiful and appropriate monuments which now grace and adorn this hill. The larger of
            these monuments stands on the site occu- pied by the rustic school house at the time of
            the massacre of Schoolmaster Brown and his scholars ; and the other, on the small mound,
            beneath which their sacred dust has long since mingled and now peacefully slumbers in
            the common grave in which they were buried. And what could have been more fitting than
            the manner and place of their burial? all deposited in the same grave, and near beside
            the little spring, still issuing from the foot of this hill, and where master and
            scholars together were wont to slake their thirst during the interim of weary school
            hours. These monuments were fashioned by skilful, artistic hands, and wrought out of the
            most enduring materials (Eastern granite and Pennsylvania limestone), and rest on deep
            and solid foundations, and will for many long centuries to come rescue from oblivion the
            sacred and hallowed spots they are intended to perpetuate. And I feel warranted in the
            prophecy, that should some distant antiquary, more than a thousand years hence, make a
            pilgrimage to this historic hill, that he will find them still intact and standing as
            erect as we behold them this day. Enoch Brown needed no monument to perpetuate his name,
            it is indelibly engraven in the history of the State, and there it will remain forever.
            ''His is one of the few immortal names that were not born to die." Yet, as a proper and
            fitting mark of love and honor to this faithful teacher and his lamented scholars, and
            in ful- fillment of a sacred and long neglected duty, these monu- ments have been
            erected and we have met here to-day to dedicate them to their memory. Note. — I was
            present at the exhumation of the remains of Teacher Enoch Brown and his scholars, and
            according to the most authentic evidence on the subject it took place on the 4th of
            August, 1843. 1^ 1 8 Enoch Brown Memorial. was my mournful privilege to gaze upon their
            still remaining moulder- ing bones and other relics connected with their burial, and
            these not only established beyond all doubt the identity of the place of their burial,
            but also the truth of the traditional story that they were all buried in one common
            grave. George W. Ziegler. PRESENTATION SPEECH OF REV. CYRUS CORT. My Christian Friends:
            — We are glad to meet you here to-day. We have had a plentiful rain. He giveth grass for
            the cattle and herb for the service of man. And now the skies are bright and the heavens
            smile upon us. That gracious Providence which has enabled us to bring all the difficult
            and dangerous labors of this monumental project to a safe and successful conclusion,
            without harm or accident, still continues to favor us. To the Lord be all the praise,
            the honor and the glory of the achievement. The greatest leader and lawgiver of the
            human race tells us to "remember the days of old and consider the years of many
            generations." This is the parting counsel of Moses. It is the swan song, yea, the
            key-note of the swan song of that man of God at the close of his earthly pilgrimage. The
            trials, the sufferings and heroic deeds of their ancestors, the gracious dealings of the
            great Jehovah in former years, were to be kept in everlasting remembrance. A reverential
            historic spirit is one of the noblest attributes of true man- hood. It is also one of
            the safeguards of society. It pro- motes the best interests of religion and patriotism.
            Such a spirit makes great account of memorial occasions. It brings us into living
            communion with the heroic past. Under the guide and inspiration of a reverential
            historic spirit the Hebrews and Greeks marched in the vanguard of human history in
            developing the ideas of religion and classic culture. In the interest of that spirit we
            are assembled to-day. To- day we rescue from oblivion hallowed scenes consecrated by the
            martyr blood of innocent childhood and the self-sacri- ficing privations of pioneers.
            To-day we commemorate a typical event, full of pathetic interest and engrave it as a
            memorial in the rock forever. The massacre of School- Presentation Speech of Rev. Cyrus
            Cart. 19 master Enoch Brown and ten scholars and the horrid mang- ling of the eleventh
            on this spot by the Indian savages, July 26, 1764, was an "outrage," says Parkman, "un-
            matched in its fiendlike atrocity through all the annals of the war," that terrible
            Pontiac war, so full of bloodshed and horror. It was an event indeed almost unique in
            human history. Hundreds of years before the dawn of the Chris- tian era a band of
            bloodthirsty Thracian soldiers wantonly butchered the teacher and all the scholars
            belonging to a boys' school at Megalissus in Greece. For thousands of years that event
            stood alone as an example of human bar- barity, as a contrast between civilization and
            barbarism, until it was outdone by the massacre of Enoch Brown and his scholars on this
            very spot 121 years ago. Here Ruth Hart and Ruth Hale, George Dunstan, Eben Taylor,
            Archie McCullough and six other innocent children were knocked on the head like so many
            beeves and the bleeding scalps torn from their mangled heads and that of Master Enoch
            Brown. O ! bloodiest chapter in the book of time ! Here a holocaust was offered to the
            red Demon of war by the red demons of the savage wilderness. My Christian friends, it is
            a sacred duty that we discharge to-day in this tribute of the living to the martyred
            dead. Long, too long have the martyrs waited for this memorial. No class of men or women
            deserve more to be held in grateful and everlasting remembrance than the hardy pio-
            neers who rescued the wilderness of this new world from savage beasts and savage men and
            changed it into a fruitful field. As citizens of this magnificent valley we enjoy the
            fruits of their toils, their sacrifices and privations, and let us never forget the
            memory of their deeds and sufferings. Be- cause Enoch Brown was an honored, useful and
            trusted instrument in the higher phases of that work of pioneer civilization and
            progress ; because he fell as a self-sacrificing martyr in that cause at the post of
            duty and of danger ; because his eleven scholars fell as innocent victims and true
            martyrs in that cause of education and Christian civilization we set apart these
            monuments and these grounds as sacred to their memory forevermore. We believe that Enoch
            Brown was a good and true man. ao Enoch Brown Memorial. Had we not thought so we would
            never have toiled as we have done to bring this movement to a successful close. He was a
            genuine Christian schoolmaster of the olden time, one who taught his scholars not only
            how to read, write and cypher, but who taught them also the first principles of our holy
            religion as recorded in the oracles of the living God. Amid perils he taught such
            principles as make good citizens and faithful Christians. Indeed, one of the cherished
            traditions of the terrible tragedy is that Schoolmaster Brown was shot down with the
            Bible in his hand before he could make any resistance and on his knees begged only that
            the innocent children might be spared. Parkman, in describing the ghastly sight that met
            those who first entered the school house after the massacre says : "In the centre lay
            the master, scalped and lifeless, with a Bible clasped in his hands; while around the
            room were strewn the bodies of his mangled pupils." Another tradition says that Mr.
            Linn, while working in a meadow in the vicinity, heard the shot that killed Schoolmaster
            Brown, and when he and others came to see what was the matter they found little Archie
            McCullough, who survived the scalping, sitting by the spring near by washing the blood
            from his face and mangled head. He told them that when the four Indians opened the door
            Master Brown, knowing well their object, begged them to take him as their victim and let
            the innocent children return to their homes. The same instant he was shot down, and then
            he and the children were quickly toma- hawked and scalped by two of the savages while
            the other two stood with murderous weapons in the doorway. Other traditions, handed down
            directly by Betty Hopkins to Gen. Detrich and others, go to show that Enoch Brown did
            his duty as a true-hearted man, who felt the awful responsibility of the sacred trust
            committed to him. Betty Hopkms was a worthy Christian woman, forty years old at the time
            of the massacre, living within a mile of this very spot. She saw the mangled bodies of
            master and ten scholars committed to a common grave by the grief-stricken and
            horror-stricken community 121 years ago, and her story of the burial was corroborated by
            the exhumation 79 years after the burial. No word derogatory to the courage or character
            of Enoch Presentation Speech of Rev. Cyrus Cort. 21 Brown ever came from her lips in the
            sixty odd years that she lived in this locality after the tragedy, which was the one
            great absorbing theme of her conversation. Often did the General, when a boy, and other
            young friends read at her request her favorite chapter in the Bible (the 1 7th of the
            Gospel according to St. John), and then listen in return to the story of the massacre of
            Enoch Brown and his ten scholars. At length this remarkable woman, this traditional and
            Providential bond between the living and the dead, passed away at the good old age of
            104 years, when she was consigned to her last resting place by the General himself.
            Apart from all traditionary accounts, one way and another, there is enough in the very
            nature of things to vindicate the memory of Enoch Brown from all aspersions of cowardice
            or incompetency. Cowards are not apt to teach school on exposed frontiers in perilous
            times. The Scotch-Irish pio- neer settlers were heroic. God-fearing people. No matter
            what some of their descendants may do they would have died in their tracks rather than
            disappoint a trust, and they would never have entrusted the lives and education of their
            precious children to an incompetent poltroon. They were brave and true themselves and
            expected courage, honor and fidelity from all in official position. And when the savages
            came in all their fiendish fury and desolated ten Christian homes at one fell swoop, by
            butchering those innocent chil- dren on this very spot, when there was bitter
            lamentation and weeping throughout the Conococheague settlement and Antrim's hills
            resounded with the wails of mothers refusing to be comforted over the destruction of
            their darling house- hold treasures, think you that those true-hearted, high-souled men
            and women would have buried their precious children in a common grave with Enoch Brown
            had they not es- teemed the schoolmaster as a good, true man, who did all he could to
            protect and save the little ones entrusted to his care? Never, never, would they have
            given him such an honorable sepulture along with their slaughtered innocents had he not
            been a worthy and deserving man. We know little of the particular families represented
            in this massacre. The McCulloughs still remain among our most worthy citi- zens. The
            Harts and Hales, the Dunstans and Taylors, a a Enoch Brown Memorial. who patronized this
            school and who furnished a victim each, have removed or become extinct so far as we
            know. We know of others, however, who attended this pioneer school, who were
            Providentially absent on that fatal day, and by their high character we may judge in a
            measure the teacher and scholars in general. Here came Eleanor Cochrane, who became the
            wife of Captain Joseph Junkin, a hero of the Revolutionary War, whose right arm was
            shattered by a musket ball at the battle of Brandywine. She bore him 14 children, 10
            sons and 4 daughters. Two of the sons, George and D. X. Junkin, became ministers of the
            Gospel, and two of the daughters married ministers. In all about thirty of the sons,
            sons-in-law and grandchildren are in the ministry, and a still larger number are ruling
            elders. Three of the sons were officers in the war of 181 2-14. One of the
            granddaughters is the wife of Col. Preston, at Lex- ington, Va., and a gifted poetess.
            Another granddaughter was the wife of the renowned chieftain of the Southern
            Confederacy, Stonewall Jackson. A granddaughter is the wife of the reverend gentleman
            (Rev. Woods,) who will speak to you from this stand to-day and we are glad to have her
            with us on the platform enjoying these memorial services in honor of the martyred
            companions of her ancestors. What possibilities are enshrined in the life of one little
            girl ! Here also came Mary Ramsey, the grandmother of our ven- erable and beloved
            friend. Rev. John R. Agnew, also present with us, and the grandmother also of his
            excellent wife and other notable members of the Agnew family and its kindred branches.
            Two of Mary Ramsey's nieces, the Misses Irwin, married sons of President Wm. H.
            Harrison. Here also came the Poes, renowned in civil as well as military affairs. You
            have all heard of the Poe boy who played truant on that particular day and watched
            mowers in a meadow and caught a thrashing from his strict old father for telling a lie
            in the evening, claiming that he was at school not having heard of the massacre. Bad
            boys no doubt have often thought of this as a justification for playing truant. The
            moral of the fable being that the boy who plays truant saves his scalp. It reminds one
            of the dialogue between a father and a son who was hard to get out of bed in the morning
            : " Tom, get up ; Presentation Speech of Rev. Cyrus Cort. 23 the early bird gets the
            worm. " " Served him right. If he had not been up so early he would not have been
            caught. ' ' Now, my friends, I have a new revelation to make, which mars the proportions
            of the old story somewhat. Last Saturday I received a letter from Mrs. Fannie B.
            Campbell, well-known to many present, under date of July 29, at Clifton Springs, N. Y.
            Mrs. Campbell writes : " Dear Mr. Cort : Yours received to-day. The only tradition I
            have from the Poe family of the massacre of Enoch Brown and children, is that
            grandfather James Poe was a scholar attend- ing the school at the time, but was detained
            that day by his mother objecting to his going on account of the cold. He was a very
            small boy, and had to be sent on horseback in charge of a servant. On that day the horse
            was at the door waiting for him when his mother interfered. So his life was spared and
            like the small boy in the Sunday school book, he lived to grow up and go to the
            Legislature twenty years." That is the latest tradition of the Poe story, and it would
            be a very acceptable substitute for the truant story if they had only left out that cold
            wave right on the 26th day of July, 1764. Benj. M. Nead, Esq., tells us in Dr. Egle's "
            Historical Notes," that at the time James Poe was a lad 16 years old, and went with the
            party of settlers under Lieut. Potter in pursuit of the Indians who had massacred the
            schoolmaster and scholars at Guitner's school house. This spoils the truant boy story
            again. These conflicting traditions show how even good, reliable people get things
            mixed. They remind us of the man who said he once saw wheat standing so thick that wild
            turkeys could run over the tops of the heads without sinking to the ground. When asked
            about the size of the turkeys he said they were whop- pers. One day he shot one and it
            was so heavy that he threw it over his shoulder and it was so large that the head
            dragged in the snow behind him. When some one remarked that that must have been a queer
            country where they had snow in harvest time, he replied, '' I believe I did get my story
            a little mixed." So is it with many of these floating traditions. They are a good deal
            mixed. But be that as it may, the Poes and Potters did really stand in close rela-
            tionship to this school. The Lieut. Potter who led in pur- 24 Enoch Brown Memorial. suit
            of the bloodthirsty Indians afterwards became a Gen- eral in the Revolutionary army and
            James Poe was Captain under him and was married to his daughter. *James Poe was for many
            years an honored Representative and Senator in the State Legislature. His son Thomas was
            Adjutant and a very gallant soldier in the war of 1 812-14, and fell mor- tally wounded
            in the battle of Chippewa. This gives us an idea of the class of people who patronized
            the school of Enoch Brown on these grounds 121 years ago. They be- longed to the best
            class of pioneer settlers, people who came to America for conscience sake, that they and
            their children might have freedom to worship God. An eminent historian (Dr. Wm. H. Egle)
            from the capital of our own Keystone State is here to-day to tell us about Pontiac **the
            lord of the savage wilderness," who marshalled the savage hordes as no Indian chief ever
            marshalled them before or since, in that great war of which this massacre of the master
            and scholars was one of the characteristic incidents. He will tell us also about the
            superb man who hailed from the Alpine mountains of Republican Switzerland, the heroic
            Bouquet, who with his Scotch Highlanders, his German-Swiss Royal Americans and
            Provincial Rangers, signally defeated the confederates of Pontiac at Bushy Run the year
            before this massacre occurred, and vainly begged the Quaker provincial authorities to

            delay and fourteen days after this massacre he at length was able to set out from
            Carlisle on that memor- able campaign of 1 764, which brought peace and tranquility to
            the borders and restored several hundred white captives to the blessings of Christian
            homes and civilization. Strange, passing strange it is, that the plowshare should so
            long have been allowed to pass over the site of the school house and the harvests
            fertilized by the blood of master and scholars should so long have been reaped on this
            sacred spot. Strange that the common grave of master and ten scholars *Both of these
            officers lie buried at the Brown's Mill graveyard, a few miles east of the Enoch Brown
            Park. Presentation speech of Rev. Cyrus Cort. 25 that this the most sacred historic spot
            of our noble old county, should remain so long without monumental column or memo- rial
            tablet, to be profanely trodden under foot of man and beast. Thank God that reproach no
            longer rests upon the people of Franklin county and Antrim township. In this hour of
            rejoicing, when the capstone is to be brought forth, as it were, with shoutings, let us
            not forget the veterans who forty-two years ago exhumed the remains of Enoch Brown and
            scholars, who identified the grave and verified the tradi- tion of their common
            sepulture. Without their pioneer work the waves of oblivion would doubtless long since
            have obliterated all traces of that hallowed spot, fuller of pathetic interest than any
            other in all the broad domain of the Cum- berland Valley. We are glad to welcome these
            veterans to-day. They bind us with golden chains to the hoary past. We are glad to have
            one of them, Geo. W. Ziegler, Esq., preside over these memorial services, who has been a
            great help and inspiration in this movement. Also to have two others, Dr. J. K. Davison
            and Gen. Detrich, as vice presi- dents, all enjoying a good old age. In the language,
            slightly modified, of the immortal Webster to the veterans of Bunker Hill, sixty years
            ago, allow me to say '' Venerable men ! you have come down to us from a former
            generation. Heaven has bounteously lengthened out your lives that you might behold this
            joyous day. You are now where you stood forty-two years ago this very hour with your
            brothers and neighbors in philanthropic efforts. Behold how altered. The same heavens
            are indeed over your heads, the same fountain flows at your feet. But all else how
            changed ! Alas ! you are not all here — Koser, Michaels, Rankin, Sites, Grubb, Rowe,
            Mitchell, Osbaugh, Short, Shirey, Atherton, our eyes seek in vain for you amidst this
            broken band. You are gathered to you fathers but live in our grateful remem- brances. *
            * All is peace and God has granted you this sight of your country's happiness ere you
            slumber in the grave forever. He has allowed you to partake of the reward of your
            patriotic toils ; and he has allowed us, your sons and countrymen, to meet you here and
            in the name of the pres- ent generation, in the name of your country, in the name of
            liberty and civilization, to thank you. * * May the B 26 Enoch Brown Menwriat. Father of
            all mercies smile upon your declining years and bless them." We are glad to hail to-day
            as our gifted Poet and a true son of Antrim, one who years ago labored to bring about
            this very memorial work which has at last been accomplished under the auspices of the
            county at large. All honor to the pioneer settlers and all honor to the pioneer workers
            in the movement to honor the memory of Enoch Brown and his slaughtered scholars. On the
            2 2d day of April, 1884, a convention of represen- tative delegates from all parts of
            Franklin county, met in the Court House at Chambersburg, to devise measures to pro- mote
            the proper celebration of the one hundredth anniver- sary of the organization of the
            county, on the coming 9th of September. In the progress of their deliberations, it was
            resolved at the instance of Col. Geo. B. Wiestling, that a permanent memorial of the
            Centennial should be erected in the form of a monument, to perpetuate the memory of
            School- master Brown, and the ten scholars ruthlessly massacred by the Indians on this
            spot, 120 years previous. An appeal was made by the convention to the patriotic and
            Christian liberality of all the churches and schools, both secular and religious, week
            day and Sunday schools throughout the county,in aid of this enterprise, also to public
            spirited citizens in their individual capacity. The Centennial Executive Committee at
            Chambersburg was directed by the Conven- tion to secure a generous rebate in aid of this
            monument fund, from all the railroads, on all excursion tickets issued on account of the
            Centennial Celebration. This was the unanimous action of the Convention, and the sum of
            at least ^2,000 was pledged to the Monument Committee, which I have the honor to
            represent, wherewith to buy the land, erect the monument and make all other needed im-
            provements. The Monument Committee have honestly and earnestly striven to carry out in
            good faith the wishes of the County Centennial Convention as best they could with the
            means placed at their disposal. They had a right to expect the generous assistance and
            hearty co-operation of every preacher, teacher, sclfblar and public spirited citizen of
            the county. The faith of the entire county was pledged to I Presentation Speech of Rev.
            Cyrus Cort. 27 make the monumental project a grand success. But, alas ! your committee
            was doomed to bitter disappointment. A generous rebate amounting to ;^758 was
            contributed by the railroads, as the Convention had requested, but ^334 of that rebate
            never came into the hands of our Monument Committee. The bad example of this breach of
            faith in of- ficial circles was contagious and had a demoralizing effect. The majority
            of churches and schools of all kinds have utterly failed to do their duty in the
            premises. In all, up to date, your Committee has received less than ^1,400, instead of
            at least ^2,000, solemnly pledged by the sovereign con- vention, April 22, 1884. Of this
            amount, ;^9i.77 has been contributed by the churches; about ^260 by the week day
            schools, and the same amount (^260) by the Sunday schools of the county. Had it not been
            tor the liberal subscriptions of individuals, headed by Geo. W. Ziegler, Esq., amounting
            in all to ^335, your committee would have been seriously hindered in the prosecution of
            their work. Although the public schools of Green castle with their six teachers and
            hundreds of scholars, only gave $5.75, yet Antrim township and Greencastle raised the
            handsome sum of ^332. Well done for Mother Antrim ! She has raised nearly one-fourth of
            the entire cost. We point to this noble and enduring granite monument erected on the
            very spot where Enoch Brown and his ten scholars shed their precious blood, 121 years
            ago ; we point to the smaller, but equally enduring and appropriate monu- ment, which,
            beautiful in its simplicity, a few rods from here, maiks the spot where repose in a
            common grave the mortal remains of the massacred master and scholars; we point like-
            wise to this picturesque park of field and forest, containing a fraction less than
            twenty acres, all paid for and held in fee simple by your committee in trust for the
            people of the county, this tract which encloses the historic spring at the bottom of the
            hill, where little Archie McCullough washed the streaming blood from his face and
            scalpless head ; we point to these memorials and possessions as the best answer to the
            question as to how we have discharged our duties as custodians of the Enoch Brown
            Monument Fund. In the face of all manner of obstacles ; in spite of all manner of 28
            Enoch Brown Memorial . misrepresentation and abuse, we have persistently labored to
            carry out in good faith the patriotic and benevolent inten- tions of the Centennial
            Convention. As the walls of Jerusa- lem were built in the days of Nehemiah, with sword
            in one hand and trowel in the other, so this monument project has been carried forward.
            The memory of Enoch Brown, the noble-hearted, self-sacrificing Christian schoolmaster,
            has been vindicated against unjust aspersions, and after the lapse of 1 2 1 years, a
            granite monument, as enduring ^ the grand old mountains that loom up in majesty on the
            sides of the North, now covers the spot where he and his youthful scholars fell as
            pioneer martyrs in the cause of education and Christian civilization. The question has
            been asked time and again, "What good will the monument do? Why go to all this trouble
            and expense about people killed 121 years ago?" We can not expect to satisfy some people
            with any argument that we may offer. Like the terrapins or land turtles that lately
            crawled around the grave of Enoch Brown and scholars, they have no reverential historic
            spirit and mope about most sacred scenes concerned entirely with the question, what
            shall we eat or what shall we drink ? But for thinking men and the rising generations
            the monuments will teach an im- portant lesson and have an enobling educational
            influence. It will open up to many a most important chapter of history and fill their
            hearts with gratitude to the brave men and women who bore the brunts in the fierce
            struggle between civilization and barbarism. In the language of Horatio Seymour, in his
            letter to the chairman of your committee, these monuments " will tell us of the past and
            instruct with regard to the duties of life and the virtues of patriotism. We feel as we
            look upon them that the dead speak to us. They will do much to instruct and improve our
            citizens. ' ' It will show that this generation had some higher thoughts and aspirations
            than the mere scramble after filthy lucre, the degrading worship of Mammon. As Webster
            argued at Bunker Hill, it will evoke and appeal not only to lofty thoughts, but to that
            other important part of our being which has so much to do with the interests of religion
            and patriotism, *' to sentiment and imagination." And where Presentation Speech of Rev.
            Cyrus Cort. 29 in all the realms of romance and fancy do we find a more pathetic story
            than the massacre and common burial of Enoch Brown and scholars? The simple recital of
            this terrible tragedy stirs emotions at times too deep for tears. And, my friends, rest
            assured that when all the beauty and chivalry of Franklin county, here assembled to-day,
            shall sleep beneath the green clods of the valley, this place will be a pilgrim shrine,
            increasing in interest as age after age rolls by. These are " Shrines to code nor creed
            confined, The Delphian vales, the Palestines, The Meccas of the mind." I pity the person
            who has so little patriotic and religious sentiment as to ask, as some are doing: ''What
            good will the monument do ? Might not this money have been ap- plied to more useful
            purposes ? Why not give it to the poor or the Children's Aid Society of Chambersburg ?"
            This is but the doleful echo of that harsh old mercenary and selfish spirit which found
            its proper exponent in Judas Iscariot, who was filled with indignation because the
            grateful Mary anointed the blessed Master with three hundred penny- worth of precious
            ointment. ''Might not this have been sold and given to the poor," exclaimed the arch
            traitor and thief. Over against this sanctimonious and Pharisaic spirit we place the
            gracious words of the blessed Master: "Let her alone. Why trouble ye her ? She hath done
            what she could. She hath wrought a good work on me. Against the day of my burying she
            hath kept this. For ye have the poor with you always, and whensoever ye will ye may do
            them good, but me ye have not always. Verily I say unto you, wheresoever this gospel
            shall be preached throughout the whole world, this also that she hath done shall be
            spoken of for a memorial of her. ' ' Like the odor of a sweet smell the fragrance of
            that self-sacrificing deed of love comes float- ing down the ages full of instruction
            and heavenly benediction . Away with that low, groveling, utilitarian spirit which dares
            to rob the world of its beauty, its sunshine and song, which measures by dollars and
            cents the immeasurable debt of gratitude due our heroic pioneer ancestors ! Thank God,
            the debt so long unpaid, and the work so long delayed, has not been entirely forgotten.
            All honor to the Centennial County Convention, of April 22, '84, and to all the good
            people who have helped with their dimes and dollars to build the monument. We wish the
            monument was worthier the wealthy county on whose bosom it stands. But such as it is, we
            take pleasure in handing it over to the teachers, scholars and citizens of Franklin
            county. Here is ■embodied the spirit of generous-hearted patriotism. Here are
            concentrated the offsprings of the poor and the rich, the dime of the bare-footed school
            boy and school girl, and the liberal benefactions of the wealthy. Here, too, the rich
            and poor will meet together for ages, and dwell upon the toils and trials of pioneer
            settlers, as illustrated in the massacre and burial of master and scholars in a common
            grave. And now, in behalf of the Enoch Brown Monument Com- mittee, appointed April 22,
            1884, by the Frankhn County Centennial Convention, I hand over these monuments, these
            hallowed grounds, all these rare historic treasures, to the teachers, scholars and
            people of Franklin county, to be cher- ished throughout all coming generations. Without
            debt or incumbrance, we give them. Here in my hand I hold the deed for these lands in
            fee simple given in trust for the use of the schools and the people. Take them, and may
            they be an inspiration and a benediction through all coming time, helping posterity to
            '' remember the days of old and consider the years of many generations. ' ' God bless
            the teachers, scholars and people of Franklin county. ADDRESS OF PETER A. WITHER, ESQ.
            OF HAGERSTOWN, MD., And Superintendent of Public Schools in Washington County , Md. Upon
            the invitation of the committee having charge of these memorial ceremonies, I am here,
            as a representative of your sister State of Maryland, to join in the tribute which we
            are met to pay to the manly sacrifices, and heroic endur- ance of the pioneers who here
            conquered the untamed wild- ness of nature, that we, their children and successors,
            might Address of Peter A. Witmer, Esq. 31. enjoy, in peace and prosperity, the fertile
            soil, the health- giving climate, the beautiful scenery, and the happy homes which have
            made the Cumberland Valley the synonym of the '' Paradise of America." We are met, as I
            understand it, to recall the days when this beautiful valley was covered with primeval
            forests, and a robust, but some crude, civilization was pressing forward to conquer the
            wildness of nature and the still more stub- bom wildness of the savage inhabitants who
            roamed at will over these hills and through these valleys. We stand, to-day, on what,
            one hundred and- twenty years ago, was the utmost verge of American civilization.
            Beyond, toward the setting sun, was a howling wilderness; yonder, toward the rising sun,
            thirteen feeble colonies, apparently depending for exis- tence upon the mother country
            across the seas, inhabited by less than 3,000,000 people, constituted the Anglo-Saxon
            contingent which was to win to civilization and to freedom the grandest empire the world
            has ever seen. To-day that conquest has been made. Look around you and behold it. An
            almost limitless expanse of territory, reaching from ocean to ocean and from the lakes
            to the gulf; embracing every variety of surface, soil and climate, studded with cities
            and villas, with commercial marts and thriving inland towns, through which courses, in
            ceaseless pulsations, the full tide of an ever restless commerce ; traversed by 125,000
            miles of railways, which carry your products on the wings of the winds, chequered by
            500,000 miles of electric wires, which transmit intelligence with the velocity of
            thought, watered by a thousand rivers, which make your valleys bloom and bourgeon like
            an Eden ; filled with an active, busy, bustling population, the whole ruled by what we
            be- lieve to be the best government ever organized by man. See, all over your land, the
            studios of art, where the skill of the painter makes, instinct with beauty, the living
            canvas, and the sculptor's genius moulds the breathing marble into forms of life, and
            soul and passion ; your courts, where Justice sits enthroned, crowned with a people's
            majesty, your halls of Legislature, where eloquence ^' rules her wilderness of free
            minds, ' ' your schools, and colleges, and universities, where the youth of the land are
            trained to meet 32 Enoch Brown Memorial . like men the responsibilities of life, your
            eleemosynary- institutions, where charity comes like a benediction to so many weary
            hearts, your Sunday-schools, the great auxiliaries of the church in the work of human
            redemption ; and, finally, your churches, the beautiful architectural creations of
            Christian ingenuity, and opulent devotion, whose spires are pointing the hopes of
            immortal flocks to the great Unseen Shepherd, while their choirs and organs pour forth,
            over hill and valley, a full tide of choral harmony, which, swelling in one grand
            diapason to the heavens, dies away at last in soft melodious cadence, at the foot of the
            throne of Him whose praise it celebrates. This and more than this is your country. Such
            is the structure which has been reared upon foundations laid strong, and deep, and
            broad, by the men whose virtues and heroism we are here to-day to recount and
            commemorate. In this connection I have been asked to refer to the part which Maryland
            took in the stirring events which have been so eloquently portrayed by the gentlemen who
            have already addressed you, and whilst I shall not enter upon historical details, I may
            say, generally, that Maryland in the colonial days stood fast by the fortunes of her
            sister colonies. Her fame is full of honor, in peace and in war. Sprung directly from
            the loins of the mother country, her sons inherited the spirit of freedom which wrung
            from King John the Magna Charta, and, subsequently, from England's royal line, still
            greater concessions. Imbued with that spirit, the founders of Maryland, when they landed
            on St. Mary's shore, planted there the emblem of Christ's suffering and man's salvation,
            and forever dedicated her soil to civil and religious liberty. She contributed freely of
            her blood and treasure to defend herself and her sister colonies from the rude assaults
            of the savage, and the more insidious but more dangerous advances of English tyranny,
            and if she failed to send a proper con- tingent to the Pontiac war it was because she
            was even then resisting the first attempts of England to tax the resources of the
            colonies to fill her depleted coffers. She became, as you all know, with your own great
            State, a child of the Revolution, and received upon her head its baptism of fire and
            blood. Address of Peter A. Witmer, Esq. 33 The Maryland Line met the scarlet uniform and
            the glit- tering steel of England from the first dark hours of Bunker Hill to the final
            and triumphant glory at Yorktown, and she points with pride to her brilliant record
            through all that long and bloody career. It is enough to know, my friends, that through
            the suffer- ings, the sacrifices and the many achievements of our fathers, to whose
            memory we have this day met to do honor, we are permitted to enjoy the priceless
            blessings of American liberty, and I shrink from claiming for the State which I have the
            honor to represent, and which I love so well, credit or fame, in any degree above that
            which belongs to each of the whole glorious thirteen. But this occasion suggests another
            train of thought. We are here to dedicate a monument to the humble man, Enoch Brown, the
            teacher, who with his pupils, and on this very spot, fell a victim to the savage
            ferocity of the Indian and to duty. The world is full of monuments, but their inscrip-
            tions usually blazon the deeds of warriors, statesmen, poets. Rarely does the world rear
            the monumental pile to the humble school teacher. Fidelity, honor, faith, truth may all
            be his, and a moral heroism which, in the path of duty, scorns to turn aside from death
            ; but these evoke no admira- tion. The glamour of war, the triumphs of eloquence, the
            rapt genius of poetry and art — these only are deemed worthy the homage of men. But
            here, one hundred and twenty-one years ago, a nobler man than warrior, politician, or
            poet, fell a martyr to duty and to civilization ; therefore, it is fit that we raise
            this monument. It is right that the moral heroism, the undaunted courage, the sublime
            and splendid disregard of self and life which Enoch Brown ex- hibited should be
            perpetuated in stone, which, I trust, will be as enduring as the eternal hills that now
            look down upon it. True, he who lived so well, and died so nobly, and sleeps so calmly
            here, may not know what we now do. No storied urn, or animated bust, Back to its mansion
            calls the fleeting breath ; Nor Honor's voice provokes the silent dust, Nor Flattery
            soothes the dull, cold ear of death ; but 1 believe that at the last Grand Assize, when
            the Judge 34 Enoch Brown Memorial. of all the earth shall pronounce humanity's final
            doom, ft shall be said of Enoch Brown, as Christ said of Mary, he hath done what he
            could. With the spirit of our Great Exemplar, he begged his brutal murderers to spare
            his pupils and take his life as a vicarious offering for them, And here is one great
            lesson that teachers may well learn — the lesson of love for those placed under their
            care. Love your pupils and they will reciprocate the feeling with all the fervor that
            glows in young hearts. Let them feel that you are their friend, not their master, and
            the spirit of insubordination will give way to confidence and trust. This brings me, my
            friends, to a brief presentation of another subject which. the mandate of your committee
            im- poses — the educational idea suggested by these ceremonies. Time will not permit me
            to enter into any general history of education, nor indeed, of this country. A rapid
            review of educational movements in your own great commonwealth is all that can be
            attempted. It is well known that education in our early colonial time, and for many
            years after, was under the supervision and control of the various religious
            organizations of the country, and it is altogether probable that the school conducted
            here by Enoch Brown was, in some sort, a parochial school. It is true that almost every
            colony had on its statute books provisions for the establishment of schools for the
            general education of the people, in other words, public schools; still these laws were,
            for different reasons, generally ineffec- tive and inoperative. As early as 1787, the
            General Government, in the famous ordinance for the government of the North-West
            Territory, set apart the sixteenth section of land in every township for the maintenance
            of public schools, basing their action upon the memorable declaration, that ''Religion,
            morality and knowledge, being necessary to good government and the happiness of mankind,
            schools and the means of educa- tion shall be forever encouraged." Under this, and
            subse- quent similar grants, an aggregate of not less than 140,000,- 000 acres of land
            have been set apart by the Government for educational purposes. Thus, early in the
            history of our Address of Peter A. Witmer, JEsq, 35 country, the General Government
            placed itself upon record as committed to the principles upon which our free or com- mon
            schools of to-day are founded. Coming to the history of public instruction in your own
            great State, we find that so early as 1682, William Penn inserted in the form of
            government for his new province the provision, that "The Governor and the Provincial
            Council should erect and order all public schools," but the authority so vested was not
            exercised until many years after. Your constitutions of 1776 and 1790 both contained
            pro- visions for the establishment of schools throughout the State, in which the poor
            were to be taught gratis, but the benevolent intentions of those who enacted these
            provisions were thwarted from the fact that they imposed the badge of poverty upon a
            certain element in the community, who resented with spirit the reproach which they
            believed such legislation was intended to fix upon them. The Act of your Assembly,
            passed in 1809, contained the same objec- tionable features and it was not until 181 8
            that legislation was secured, through the efforts of a number of the most prominent
            citizens of your State, which was supposed to abolish all class distinctions. This
            legislation was, however, local in its character, and applied only to the city of Phila-
            delphia, and, even there, failed to remove the impression that it fixed the stigma of
            pauperism upon the poorer classes, as all previous laws were supposed to have done. The
            experiments which had been tried, and the efforts which had been made to establish a
            common school system, culmi- nated in the passage of an Act in 1 834, amended and
            improved in 1836, which is really the first common school law of this commonwealth. It
            established schools for the instruction of youth without regard to social or pecuniary
            condition. It established them upon the broad principles that public education is a
            public necessity, and must be maintaftied at public expense — that access to your
            schools must be free to all, just as access is free to any other public institution
            established for public comfort, convenience and use. There has been legislation
            affecting your public schools since 1835, but this legislation incorporated only such
            improvements as experience and an advancing civilization suggested, and 36 Enoch Brown
            Memorial. now your school system stands boldly out as one of the most important factors
            of those splendid commercial, social and educational results which Pennsylvania to-day
            presents to the world. A State which appropriates annually ten mil- lions in money for
            the support of 2,300 teachers, and the education of 1,000,000 of her children, may well
            be proud of her educational record. And now, my friends, is it necessary to inquire what
            this school system is worth, or to ask whether the results justify the expenditures ? As
            one who has been identified with the work of public instruction, in my own State, lor
            the last eighteen years, I say, with entire confidence in the truth of my statement,
            that your public school system is worth all that you pay for it. We assume as postulates
            the trite propositions first, that our form of government is founded in and rests upon
            the virtue and intelligence of the people ; secondly, that the public or common school
            is the best vehicle for the dissemi- nation of this public virtue and popular
            intelligence. I shall not stop to discuss these propositions, since, whilst they do not
            probably challenge universal assent, we appre- hend no gentleman would risk his
            reputation for knowledge of the essential characteristics of our national life by
            disput- ing the first, and no ambitious politician, aspiring to the spoils of office,
            would venture to do violence to the settled convictions of his constituents by publicly
            demurring to the second. The school house is everywhere, all over this land, regarded as
            an exponent of our civilization, I may say, in- deed, as one of its pioneers, for
            whenever on broad prairie, or in fertile Western valley, or on auriferous mountain side,
            the sturdy emigrant presses his way to subjugate the forest, turn the virgin soil, or
            open the mine, there, too, we find the school house, at once the emblem of our
            civilization and the perpetual promise of intellectual progress to our country. I know
            that there are men in every State, and in every com- munity, men who, while professing
            to criticise only defects in the system, strike at its very life. These gentlemen say
            that your public school system is simply a great charity for the benefit of the poor,
            and should therefore be limited to the most elementary instruction, while the money
            intended Address of Peter A. Witmer, Esq, 37 for its support should be doled out with
            something of the liberality which a miser exhibits in dispensing alms. Your schools, my
            friends, are no more a charity than your courts or your roads maintained at public
            expense for the bgnefit and convenience of all. Again these critics say the train- ing
            received at public schools unfit some people for their proper sphere in life, in other
            words, it makes the poor young man dissatisfied with his lot. In answer to this, I thank
            God that it does. Who shall fix any boy's future position in this life, in this age, and
            especially in this free America, where we recognize no royalty of blood but that which
            shows itself in an honest, earnest, manly life; no aristocracy but the aristocracy of
            the intellect ; no nobility but that which derives its letters-patent from the King of
            Kings. I thank God for the aspirations which glow in the young hearts of the poor boys
            all over this land toward a better, a nobler and a higher life, and I pity the folly and
            the imbecility of the man who would seek to repress these aspirations or fix in a mould
            the future destiny of the youth of this country. As well attempt to bridle the winds or
            chain the cyclone, or to crush out the hope that lives in every Christian heart, of a
            happy life beyond the dark- flowing river. I appeal to every father and mother in this
            presence not to repress or hamper the development of mind in their children. We know not
            what possibilities of action and achievement are wrapped up in their young souls, and we
            should prove recreant to every parental duty and relation should we attempt to fix
            limits to the development of these possibilities. That we are a much better educated
            people than we were a half century ago will not be disputed, and this is due, in our
            opinion, in a great degree, to the prevailing belief that education enables a man to
            lift himself in the social scale and generally to improve his condition in life. The
            public school is the most potential agency in this general diffusion of intelligence,
            and it, therefore, becomes a people, who would occupy a front rank among the States of
            the Union, to foster their public school system. It may have defects, it has defects,
            but its work is none the less important, and its triumphs have been none the less 38
            Enoch Brown Memorial. decisive, and my admonition to you, my friends, citizens of this
            great commonwealth, is to protect it, cherish it, and with a spirit rising into
            chivalry, and a love deepening into reverence, defend it through sunshine and storm. Tcf
            the teachers of Franklin county, who have contributed of their means and their labors to
            raise this monument, and who are here to commemorate the work and the service of one of
            their honorable profession, I may be permitted a word by way of suggestion and
            encouragement. I would have them remember that this is an age of remarkable mental
            activity. In every department of thought we note the earnest inquiries and anxious
            investigations of the fore- most minds of the age. It would be strange if in investiga-
            tions so far reaching, and all embracing the educational field, should be neglected. It
            has not been neglected, and in no department of inquiry shall we find greater activity
            than in that which concerns so vitally the welfare of the youth of this country. It is,
            therefore, your duty as intelli- gent teachers to keep fully abreast of the advanced
            thought of the day upon all questions relating to the proper educa- tion of children.
            You must not forget that you are the vanguard of that grand procession of the nations
            which is pressing along the world's highways to the world's ideal standard of
            perfection. It is your mission to teach the youth of the country that there are nobler
            things in life than military glory, or hoarded wealth, than the arts of the poli-
            tician, or the tricks of modern statesmanship — that a pro- gressive civilization is
            leading us onward and upward to higher and grander purposes of existence, to be wrought
            out not on the battle field, nor in heated political contests, nor even in the busy
            marts of trade, but in the quiet, peaceful homes, all over this broad land, where every
            unbought grace of life shall find its full development, and every manly in- stinct some
            object worthy of its loftiest aim. Your work embraces all humanity, and in its elevation
            of that humanity to a higher plane, in inculcating just concep- tion of moral, social
            and political duty, and in illustrating a broader brotherhood, a more generous
            civilization, and a more spiritual Christianity, there are fields of bloodless tri- umph

            guerdons to be won, such as we award to-day to Enoch Brown, richer far than the laurel
            crown of olden Greece. May you, as teachers, by the honest, intelligent and consci-
            entious discharge of every duty deserve to win that grander triumph and to wear that
            richer guerdon ; and may we all, my friends, as parents and guardians, be faithful to
            every obligation which our relations to the children impose, and so rest in the hope
            that they will revel, for ages and ages to come, in the full fruition of the splendid
            realities which we so fondly anticipate for them and for our country. ADDRESS OF REV. F.
            M. WOODS, OF MARTINSBURG, W. VA. THE SCOTCH-IRISH PIONEERS OF OUR COUNTRY. It is
            difficult for us to realize that only one short century and a quarter have passed since
            the hands of ruthless savages were steeped in the blood of helpless victims, upon the
            very spot where here to-day we stand. When you tell me that once this fair field was
            stained with the carnage of murdered school children ; that this lovely valley once rang
            and re- echoed with the wild shout of the redman, I feel disposed to ask, in view of
            what now meets the eye, how many hun- dreds of years must have elapsed since these
            things were seen and heard ? God's purposes of grace and of providence unfold very fast.
            The Indian was an unprofitable tenant of this great land, and it was needful for him to
            give way to another and better. Selfish greed drew multitudes, who thought to pluck the
            Indian's title from his hand by violence and fraud. The Spaniard must stand condemned as
            the bloody and un- just aggressor, in that day when justice shall poise her in- fallible
            scales, to determine the relative guilt of the Chris- tian and the pagan. The Castilians
            and the many adven- turers who followed in their wake, proved themselves as little
            worthy to hold the continent as their predecessors had been. These were not the men whom
            God had in prepara- 40 Enoch Brown Memorial. tion for the inheritance of this vast
            estate. They were but as the dust, and the chaff and the dried leaves, which the com-
            ing storm gathers up upon the weapons of its vanguard and tosses in wild sport before
            it. The rain which enriches the earth and makes it fruitful, and supplies its fountains,
            comes in the storm, carrying the lightning for its torch, and the thunder for the
            diapason of its martial music. Another race of people, trained in a different school;
            animated by differ- ent ambitions ; impelled by different motives, were destined to
            cross over into this fair land and claim it in the name of the great King, and to
            establish His throne as the basis and security of their own rights and the glory of
            their wide dominion. The stones ot this great temple of freedom were being hewn in the
            vast quarries of Europe. Rabid fana- ticism was made to be the pedagogue to train and
            discipline a body of men and women for the task of rescuing this coun- try from the
            grasp of its heathen occupants, and of redeem- ing it to liberty. The history of this
            valley and of the entire country, is very largely influenced by the character of the
            Scotch-Irish Presbyterianism of those early days. The Scotchman per- secuted in his own
            country, migrated to the west of the channel dividing him from Ireland, and there sought
            liberty of worship. Mingling his blood with that of his new neigh- bors, there resulted
            a compound of force and tenacity, which has made the Scotch-Irishman almost a distinct
            race of be- ing. Finding no rest for the sole of his foot in this home of his adoption,
            he again took his life in hand and gathered up his meagre substance, launched forth upon
            the ocean to find his abode where religious liberty could be enjoyed. This brought him
            to America, where he could worship God according to the dictates of a conscience
            enlightened and instructed by the word of God. These are the men whom we are proud to
            call our forefathers ; and theirs was a faith to which their descendants for a thousand
            generations may well be glad to do reverence. May we and our children, and theirs in
            turn, have the wisdom and the grace, and the courage to emulate it ! It is proper for
            us, to-day and here in the presence of this beautiful monument, to recall some of the
            more salient Address of Rev. F. M. Woods 41 points in the character of those old
            worthies, to whose noble principles and true bravery we owe so much. For with their
            sword and their bow they achieved for us the glorious record of independence. I. It is
            to be noted that they were not worthless adven- turers or mere explorers, or the
            apostles of a godless civiliza- tion. They were not the seekers of worldly treasure sim-
            ply. It was not mercenary greed which influenced their zeal. They were in search of a
            religious home, and of liberty of conscience. It was the honor of God and the blessings
            of the gospel of peace which they were resolved to secure. These privileges were denied
            them in their fatherland. They could easily have purchased a peace and remained in the
            countries from which they came, had they been willing to abjure their principles and
            their faith, and to sub- mit with plastic grace to the imperious will of a religious
            despotism. The three Hebrews of Martyr Spirit, could have obtained a like disgraceful
            immunity, could they have smothered the protests of their faithful consciences and bowed
            in tame submission to the Chaldean monarch's tyran- nical will, and worshipped the great
            image which he set up in the plain of Dura. But fired by the mighty impulse of in-
            domitable principles, they chose the flames rather than cowardly obedience. Of like
            character was the spirit of these dauntless men, who with wives and mothers, and
            daughters, forsook all and followed Christ into these wild wastes. They brought the
            precious Bible with them, and they loved its truths, and fed upon them as upon manna.
            The word of God was the Man of their counsel. They sought unto it in all their troubles
            and shaped their lives by it. Their children were taught "to fear God and to keep His
            commandments," understanding that herein is ''the whole of man." Their religion was to
            them a constant living reality. They did not keep it as a fashionable pre- tense, a
            flimsy robe of bright fastastic texture, which never saw the light, except on public and
            stated occasions. It was their ''vade mecum." In the field, or in the forest ; at home
            or on the march, or in the face of the foe, their God was their first consideration.
            Right was the law of life and the principle of action to them. 42 Enoch Brown Memorial.
            It will be readily conceded that men of this character could not be easily diverted from
            their purpose. Neither fear nor favor could disarm them. It is Christian principle which
            makes the best citizen, the best friend, the best neighbor, the best ruler. Christian
            principle makes the best pioneers. When men go out to do better for their rights with
            the Bible in their hands, and the fear of God in their hearts, they are a dangerous foe
            to meet. It is ex- tremely difficult to persuade them of defeat. They strike with an arm
            of iron, and the fire of their wrath is unquench- able till justice is satisfied and
            truth has been vindicated. The men who sought these shores for gold and silver, or in
            the spirit of discovery, were not the men who gave nerve and stabihty to the
            institutions whose foundations were laid amid the troubled waves and the rushing waters
            of those early days. The spirit of John Knox and of Patrick Ham- ilton, and of Geo.
            Wishart, is alone able to meet and over- come the obstacles which the men of that day
            had to en- counter. 2. The sufferings and trials to which these early settlers were
            subjected in the Old World, were a further step in the preparations through which Divine
            Providence was fitting them for their high and honorable destiny. Inured to hardship and
            to honest toil, the valorous sons and daughters of Eng- land, Scotland, France, Holland,
            Switzerland, Germany and Ireland, fearlessly came to these shores to conquer the
            unsubdued forests and win a righteous peace, and enjoy a godly independence. Holding to
            the essential principles of our common Presbyterianism, and deeply imbibing the rugged
            truths of a sturdy Calvinism, they were well calcu- lated to " endure hardness as good
            soldiers of Jesus Christ," and to bring into subjection the rude natives and their howl-
            ing desert home. They were accustomed to be driven from their homes and from one country
            to another. They were hunted like wild beasts. They had seen their comrades butchered in
            cold blood. Wives and husbands were torn cruelly from each other, and their children
            were slaughtered heartlessly before their eyes. They were exposed to hunger and thirst,
            and nakedness, they learned by the bitterness of experience, the full value of every
            privation. Their Chris- Address of Rev. F. M. Woods. 43 tian (!) persecuters on that
            side of the ocean were more merciless and savage than the bloody Indian with his scalp-
            ing-knife and tomahawk on this. Raised in comfort, many of them in luxury, they gave up
            home and became wan- derers and strangers, dwelling in dens and caves. But these things
            only served to give an iron tone to the nerves of their spiritual being. Hardship had no
            terrors for men of this stamp. They were trained by dark adversity for the gigantic
            struggles of the arena on this western continent. Their arms were made strong to fell
            the great trees, and to subdue the ground, and to drive back the cruel foes who met them
            in these forests. The task was far removed from the condi- tions of the child's play.
            Theirs was the death-grasp with an enemy who was in furious earnest. He who would meet
            these Greeks, must himself be a Greek of the Greeks. ''Be- hold they that wear soft
            clothing are in Kings' houses" — not on the borders, fighting the Indians, and daring
            their lives for truth and freedom to worship God. 3. It was furthermore of the first
            importance that these pilgrims and exiles, from beyond the seas, brought with them a
            very true conception of the nature and worth of right education. Their scientific
            curriculum may not have been so extensive and pretentious as that in which we glory
            to-day, "Darwinism," ''survival of the fittest," "evolu- tion," "molecules," and
            ""protoplasm" and "the physical basis of life," had not then loomed up into such clearly
            defined proportions as they have since done. And the ven- erable anthropoid monkey had
            not yet been introduced into good society as the noble progenitor of a degenerated off-
            spring. But notwithstanding these melancholy defects in their early education, our
            fathers knew something of their Bibles, and they valued it sufficiently to teach it to
            their children as an essential element in a thorough course of mental train- ing. Their
            sons and daughters were taught the importance of worshiping God and of "keeping His
            commandments." The silly aff'ectation by which the parents of this modern day seek to
            screen themselves from the keen thrusts of a guilty, reproaching conscience for
            neglecting the religious education of their children, saying that the child must be left
            to exercise its own judgment and choice, unbiased by 44 Enoch Brown Memorial. parental
            influence, is a cunning trick of the old adversary, the wily serpent, who loves nothing
            so well as to fold his slimy coils upon the family hearthstone, and to pollute with his
            presence the family altar. By this device he reaps yearly a bountiful harvest of
            priggish free-thinkers, and no-thinkers, and upstart fledglings, who think nothing so
            smart as a foppish pretension to a driveling skepticism which can giggle and nothing
            more, when the solemn realities of God, of death and of eternity are mentioned ; and he
            reaps it from the harvest-field of the church. Far be the day removed from us and from
            our land when the Bible shall be excluded from our schools. Cursed be the genius of an
            education which leaves the heart ungarnished and the moral nature, the ''inward part,"
            the ''hidden part," to become a garden of weeds. It becomes a Christian people to pay a
            worthy tribute to the old parochial school system, wherein the Word of God was a
            recognized text-book, and the rule and standard of conduct. The early settlers of this
            country were very anxious to bring the blessings of their school within easy reach of
            their children. In every little com- munity the school-house and the fort were
            established near together, and were the two points of chief concern next to the church
            itself. A mournful interest gathers around the memory of that good man, Enoch Brown,
            whose sad death the men of this generation has wisely and justly determined to enshrine
            in the hearts of their children forever. " Honor to whom honor is due." Washington is
            held in the affections of a grateful nation. Our great heroes of war, our statesmen, our
            scholars and scientists are horored by the nation, by the nations. Shall we allow this
            noble man, who fell bravely at the humble post of his duty, to sink under the waves of
            oblivion ! Let his name be made known, and his worth be written upon the shaft of the
            imperishable granite ! And let the princi- ples which he inculcated be magnified in the
            sight of our children, that they may learn to value truth and to exalt it in their
            lives. Of the few scholars who providentially survived the ter- rible massacre of the
            school of Enoch Brown, on the 26th of July, 1764, two especially were appointed to
            attain to the Address of Rev. F. M, \^oods. 45 parentage of a great number of sons and
            daughters, who shall rise up *'to call them blessed." One of the little girls became in
            the course of years the mother of the large and distinguished family of the Cham- bers',
            * of the adjacent city which bears their name. Another of those little girls was Eleanor
            Chochrane, aged seven or eight years, who was kept at home from the school on that fatal
            day by her parents. On the 24th of May, 1779, she was united in marriage to Captain
            Joseph Junkin, a brave and distinguished soldier and officer of the Revolutionary war.
            In virtue of this union she became the mother of fourteen children, ten sons and four
            daughters. These in turn became the parents of numerous offspi:ing, which shows no
            alarming signs of becoming extinct at the present time. Their children of the second and
            third generations exhibit much of the same true Calvinistic courage and strength of
            character which marked the older type. We find in this family comforting evidence that
            our God is a covenant keeping God. Of the large family born to the pious Joseph Junkin
            and Eleanor Cochrane, two of the sons, George and David, became distinguished ministers
            of the Gospel, distinguished for learning and talent; but also for their holy zeal and
            consecration to the Master's work. Two of the daughters married ministers. Of the
            descendants in the next generation many became office-holders in the church. In all
            twenty or more of the children and grand- children of Joseph and Eleanor Junkin have
            become min- isters of the Gospel ; and probably thirty have been chosen to the office of
            Ruling Elder. And there are very few if any of the children who are not Christians. God
            signalizes Himself in remembering His mercy. A son of David X. Junkin, George, who lives
            in Virginia, is married to a great great granddaughter of Gen. Andre^v Lewis, whom I
            suppose to be the officer who commanded the Virginia troops which joined Col. Henry
            Bouquet, when he marched into Ohio to punish the Indians for this atro- cious massacre.
            Thus in the fifth generation on the one side, and in the third on the other, the blood
            of the Virginia Lewises and ♦Seepage 71. 46 Enoch Brown Memorial. of the Pennsylvania
            Cochranes unites in a family of eleven children, ten of whom are now living. Of the
            family of Dr. George Junkin, two sons are able ministers of the New Testament. One is a
            distinguished and successful lawyer in Philadelphia. One of his daughters, Eleanor, was
            the first wife of the great Confederate General, T. J. Jackson, better known by his
            sobriquet of '' Stonewall " Jackson. Another of his daughters, Mrs. Margaret J. Pres-
            ton, wife of Col. J. S. L. Preston, of Lexington, Va., is widely known by her sweet and
            thrilling touch of the poet's lyre, which has awakened an echo of rapture in so many
            hearts, bringing light to those that walk in darkness and gladness to those .bowed down
            with grief and sorrow. But among so many why select only a few, when all are worthy? Let
            us all together give thanks to God for '' His wonderful works to the children of men."
            After one hun- dred and twenty-one years, as our tardy memorial to the merits of
            well-nigh forgotten worth, we reverently unveil and dedicate this beautiful shaft, which
            shall ever serve to quicken our thoughts of the stirring times witnessed upon this
            classic spot. POEM OF JOHN M. COOPER. Enoch Brown. Looking down the long vista that
            brings to our view The face of this vale when her homesteads were new, We see through
            the haze of the far-reaching years A scene so pathetic it moves us to tears. On the
            slope of a hill, near the edge of a wood. With settlements scattered around it, there
            stood A little log school house, with plain battened door, And roof of lap shingles, and
            rough oaken floor. 'Twas the height of the summer and Sol's golden tide Flowed in
            through a long row of glass in the side. While the air, as if weary from journeying far.
            Seemed scarcely to stir through the door wide ajar. Within sat the master, with hair
            white as snow. And eleven small children all ranged in a row. And their lessons they
            droned as their primers they thumbed, Till the little log house like a big bee-hive
            hummed. Both master and children were happy that mom. And had danger been hinted, would
            laughed it to scorn ; Poem of John M. Cooper, 47 For the farmers were down in the mead
            making hay, And the lambs skipped each other like children at play ; And the kine, of
            their burden relieved by the maid, Chewed their cud with content in the orchard's green
            shade ; And the partridge piped clear in the stubble of grain. And the robin was blithe
            down the red cherry lane ; And the low voice of doves came with soft, soothing sound.
            From the forest that bounded the school-house around ; And the watch-dog lay dreaming,
            nor broke on his ear E'en a faint sound of warning that danger was near. The fair face
            of nature was bright with a smile. Yet devils, red devils, stole here all the while. The
            master had risen with bible in hand, God's message to read to his tender young band,
            When, sudden as wolves on the fold fast asleep, Three savages came through the door with
            a leap — Three red painted demons, with eyes wild aglare. Like tigers whose nostrils
            scent blood in the air — Three devils incarnate, with purpose as fell As if formed in
            the black rankling bosom of hell. The lion whose jungle bold hunters invade Can defend
            it with weapons that nature has made. But alas ! the good master who fell here that day
            Had no weapon defensive — he only could pray — And prayers to the bloodhound let loose
            on the trail, Though offered by angels, will nothing avail. With a stroke of the hatchet
            his gray head they clove. And deep in his bosom the dagger they drove ; And unmoved by
            their terror, the children they smote, Till life gave its last gasping throb in the
            throat. Then red-handed devils shot down yonder dell, Like hot hissing flames through
            the wide flues of hell. When the afternoon sun shone that sad, fateful day. Some one had
            occasion to wander this way. And struck by the silence, looked in at the door, And his
            heart froze with horror, for there on the floor Lay master and children, all covered
            with gore, As if through the roof there had fallen a rain Of mingled and horrible flesh,
            blood and brain. And there Archie McCullough, with face all red With the blood of his
            own poor bleeding head — He alone living — his playmates all dead — Was crawling around
            and calling the slain, And patting their faces — alas ! how vain — In his childlike
            effort to wake them again. 48 Enoch Brown Memorial. The alarm being sounded, a youth on
            a steed Went spreading the news with the uttermost speed — No bit in the mouth nor a
            saddle on back, No curb but the halter quick loosed from the rack. The mettlesome steed
            seemed to understand The terrible errand they had in hand, And the swelling veins in his
            silken side, And the luminous glow of his nostrils wide, And the nervous spring of his
            arm and thigh, And the curve of his neck and the flash of his eye, As he haughtily
            tossed his foretop high. Seemed plainly to say he would do it or die. Then he swallowed
            the hill at a single bound. And startled the settlements far around With the rapid,
            resounding and furious pound Of his shodden hoof on the hard dry ground. As up winding
            road and through narrow lane, And out on the winding road again, And into the woods,
            where he shook the oak And frightened the deer with his thunder stroke. And over the
            clearing and down the ravine. Wherever the smoke of a cabin was seen, (Leaping the
            fences and leaping the bars As a comet would leap over moon and stars,) He carried his
            rider, M^ho, gasping for breath, Kept shouting his terrible message of death — Of master
            and children stark dead and still. In the little log school house on Guitner's hill. The
            cheek of the mother grew pallid with fear, And swooning she murmured " red devils are
            here^ Then the rake was let drop on the freshly cut hay, And the scythe left to rust in
            the swath where it lay. And the rifle was snatched from its place on the wall. And the
            shot-pouch was filled up with powder and ball. And the settlers went forth in hot search
            for the foe Who had brought on their households this burden of woe. But pursuit was in
            vain, and in sadness they turned To their desolate homes, where dim vigil lamps burned,
            And the mother sat mourning the child of her womb. As it slept the deep sleep that leads
            down to the tomb. Though long seem the hours whose seconds are grief, The space between
            death and interment is brief. And not long did the stricken mourn over their dead. Ere
            the loved ones were laid in their last earthly bed : First the master, with honor well
            due to his years ; Then the children around him, and over all tears : Address of Dr.
            William H. Egle. 49 And the hearts of a multitude throbbed in their breast As the turf
            on their cold, silent bosoms was pressed. In sorrow, with weeping, they laid them away.
            And the bones of the martyrs are there to this day ; And so long as a star shall look
            down from the sky. May this stone stand to point out the place where they lie. Together
            they suffered, together they died, And together they buried them side by side ; And
            together they rose on angels' wings Where the music of harps with golden strings Greets
            the sinless souls that cross over the river To dwell in the Land of the Blessed forever.
            And the face of the Lord shone bright, and he smiled As he said in low, loving accents
            mild, " Suffer the children to come unto me. For of such must the kingdom of heaven be."
            And he ordered the angels to fashion a crown, Lined with velvet soft and with
            eider-down, To bedeck the bruised head of old Enoch Brown. Red devils can never break in
            and slay Where that good old master is resting to-day. ADDRESS OF DR. WM. H. EGLE,'^ OF
            HARRISBURG, PA, ''Men of Antrim: Let us go backward one hundred and twenty-two years, to
            Anno Domini, One Thousand Seven Hundred and Sixty Three, The lilies of France had
            already given place to the cross of England, and thus ended, forever, the fond dream of
            the former — the establishment of a French empire in America. Founded in religious
            enthu- siasm, culminating in persecutions shocking to civilization, they attempted to
            cement and continue their power by en- dowing to the lateness of the hour, Dr. Egle only
            delivered part of the able address which he had prepared for the occasion, on " Pontiac
            and Bouquet," He had promised to revise the entire document for this publication, but a
            mul- tiplicity of other pressing duties prevented him from doing so. He has, however,
            revised, and somewhat enlarged the synopsis, published in the Valley Spirit, Aug. 5,
            1885, which we furnish below. The Doctor felt that this was all that was really
            necessary, inasmuch as a large part of the ground traversed in his speech had alreadv
            been covered by the pamphlet on Col. Bouquet and His Campaigns," and by the proceedings
            of the Bouquet Celebration at Bushy Run, Aug. 6, 1883, which are now published in full,
            along with the ceremonies of the Enoch Brown Dedication. 50 Enoch Brown Memorial.
            listing the brutality of the Aborigine, working cruelty and bloodshed, but as ever the
            case, resulting in the downfall of those inaugurating such horrors. The last of the
            French soldiers had returned to their homes, yet the resentments and bitter hatred they
            had ruthlessly kindled in the minds and hearts of the savages remained. The Indian of
            to-day is only a prototype of those of a century ago. They are just as perfidious and
            treacherous now as they were then — and it is only possible that by education and the
            power and grace of Christianity, that they may become loyal inhabi- tants of a great
            country. We are no admirers of the Indian character, and in all our researches into the
            history of America, find the same traits and the same brutal instincts, which to-day
            fire the savage breast of the perfidious Apache." The speaker continued on a further
            description of their character. Then taking up the theme of his address, ''Pontiac and
            Bouquet," he outlined the history of Col. Bouquet in his warfare against the savages,
            who so ruthlessly desolated the homes of the frontiersmen of that early period, and
            recounted the engagements had with them. After a vivid descrip- tion of the condition of
            the country and people in 1 763-64, and the atrocities of the Indians, the orator said :
            ''We now come to a dark transaction in the bloody annals of Border life, which we have
            especially assembled on this day and hour to recall. Located near this spot, in the sum-
            mer of July, 1764, was a small log building, in which a pious school-master, Enoch
            Brown, taught a group of happy little children. It was in harvest-time, on the 26th of
            July. While those in their teens were assisting in gathering the crops, the smaller ones
            only engaged in study. The lessons of the early forenoon had nearly all been recited,
            and the scholars and their faithful teacher and friend were anticipat- ing a recess from
            study. None can imagine the consterna- tion and horror pictured on the faces of the late
            joyful group when rushing through the opened door came a band of brutal Indians. How and
            whence they came, unperceived by the settlers, and by chance, upon this gronp of
            children no one relates. It was a moment of awful suspense, as the 'Ugh' of the savages
            awoke the quiet of that summer's day. I Address of Dr. William H. Egle. 51 Immediately
            the brave-hearted school-master, fully reahzing the situation and the peril of the hour,
            bade the monsters take his life, but spare the innocent children, who were crouching in
            fear before the angry and infuriated red demons of the forest. There was no pity or
            mercy in that ruthless horde. At once the work of butchering began, and in less time
            than it can be related, the bloody deed was consum- mated. Hurriedly securing the scalps
            of teacher and schol- ars, as trophies of a victory, the inhuman monsters with hellish
            satisfaction, retraced their steps and were lost in the wilderness beyond." "Why tarry
            the children? was the inquiry of the anxious frontier mother, as she looked out from her
            rude home to- wards the path to the school-house. Presently, anxiety gave way to alarm,
            and the male members of the family were sent out to learn the cause of their absence.
            How sad the dis- covery ! It was indeed ' Holy Innocents' Day ' in this new land of
            ours, and one which you, my friends, have seen fit to remember. And yet, I think I hear
            some say, what of this dark and bloody deed so disgraceful to humanity, so horrifying to
            all the finer feelings of our nature, — why com- memorate, why not allow oblivion to
            cast an eternal shadow over the transaction ? My friends, if it was only the atro- cious
            butchery of that day, we might well cover over and hide it from earthly annals forever.
            But in that sanguinary hour there were the grand and ennobling characteristics of
            Christian manhood and glory shining forth ; which have come down to us through all the
            cathedral aisles of time, and prompted us to erect in this place this memorial. The deed
            perpetrated one hundred and twenty-one years ago, is a land-mark in the history of this
            locality, and this stone will be a constant reminder of the sufferings endured by your
            ancestors, who indeed made the wilderness to blos- som as the rose, and founded through
            many trials and great sufferings, homes you now enjoy in peace and plenty. That heroic
            teacher, with the Bible in his hand imploring his brutal murderers to take his life and
            spare the innocent ones around him, eminently deserves the voiced recognition here
            given. The band of children, slaughtered through savage hate, most of whose names are
            unknown to us, have 52 Enoch Brown Memorial. a sacred memory which you do well to
            record. Their lives were sacrificed not without some grand purpose. It touched, at
            least, the hearts of the Quaker Assembly, who at once determined to place the country in
            defence. It nerved the souls of the settlers to defend their homes and wipe the heathen
            from the land. And, citizens of Antrim and this highly favored locality, you have done a
            good thing in the erection of this memorial. Dr. Egle took up the campaign of Bouquet
            after the mas- sacre here and alluded with words of praise to the Findlays and Dixons,
            the Maclays and^McDowells, the Armstrongs and Chambers's, the Jacks and Johnstons and
            Potters who accompanied him. Referring to a later period he said : ** Among the hundreds
            of Scotch-Irish who served in the war of the Revolution from the Antrim, Letterkenny and
            Lurgan of old not one turned Tory. Born among priva- tion and tyranny, in the sternness
            of integrity and heartfelt piety, with the Bible in one hand and the trusty rifle in the
            other, let us give the meed of praise to the early settlers of this locality, whose
            crowning excellence was their devotion to religion and their unflinching duty to God and
            man. ' ' After tracing Bouquet's course in the west with his army, partly made up of the
            men just described, narrating the recapitulation of the Indians and the ultimate success
            of the brave commander, Dr. Egle concluded : '' Thus ended the power of the Western
            Indians, and the war inaugurated by Pontiac and Kyasutha closed. The peace which ensued
            lasted for a period of ten years, and confidence and security were given to the pioneers
            of the west. The frontiers were removed from this locality west of the Alleghenies, and
            never more did the foot of the hostile savage tread this beautiful valley. It was during
            this period of quietude that emigration to the valley of the Ohio's headwaters was per-
            manently commenced — when the foundations were laid of great and powerful States now
            holding a controlling influ- ence in the American nation. To Col. Henry Bouquet, the
            gallent Swiss officer, more than to any other who served in the French and Indian war,
            are we indebted for much of the prosperity which followed. He was incomparably a strong
            man — firm and decided as an officer and intrepid Address of Dr. Wm. H. Egle 53 as a
            soldier. His remains rest in an unknown grave on the Florida coast, but his name and
            fame are inseparably con- nected with the history of our State. He did signal service in
            his day and generation, and the influence of his heroic deeds has thrilled unumbered
            hearts through the years which have intervened." ''Pontiac and Bouquet ! The first the
            personification of a savage Napoleon, brutal, inhuman and treacherous — mur- der and
            lust glaring his eye-balls — pollution and baseness in all his acts. The latter — a man
            standing out grand and glorious, fulfilling life's noble destiny, magnanimous as he was
            brave, a soldier by education, but an upright citizen and Christian gentleman. The
            former not the ideal repre- sentative of his race, but the true, with all the evil of
            human nature; the latter with the God-like attributes of mankind." *^Men of Antrim, I am
            done. With the work you have this day completed do not imagine that your duties of life
            are finished. In commemorating the virtues of the school- master of the long ago you
            should not forget the glorious principles which underlie all noble actions. Instil into
            the minds of your children a reverence for the good, by precept as well as by example.
            If the pious teacher of one hundred and twenty-one years ago deserves this commemorative
            stone, let the remembrance of the events of that era fre- quently cause you to reflect
            upon the blessings you enjoy and thank God that you live in prosperous peace. ' '
            APPENDIX. r^^ CHRISTIAN NAME OF SCHOOLMASTER BROWN. Considerable ado was made last
            summer by one of the Chambersburg papers over a supposed mistake in the name of the
            martyred schoolmaster. It was alleged, on the pre- tended authority of Dr. Egle, that
            his name was Hugh in- stead of Enoch. In a conversation with the writer on the evening
            of Dedication Day, in presence af Poet Cooper, Dr. Egle emphatically remarked that he
            never had author- ized such statements. Said he, '* I never said that the school-
            master's name was Hugh or that it was not Enoch. In my speech to-day I repeatedly called
            him Enoch. We must take tradition where we have no history that positively con- tradicts
            it. I spent several days in Carlisle recently exam- ining the old lists of Cumberland
            county taxables, etc., but found no mention of either Enoch or Hugh Brown among them."
            General David Detrich and his aged sister, Mrs. Diehl, also Mrs. Scott, besides other
            old citizens, affirm that Betty Hopkins always called the schoolmaster Enoch ; Mrs.
            Scott heard her call him Enoch nearly eighty years ago. Capt. C. F. Bonner is a great
            grandson of the massacred teacher, and says all the family traditions gave him the name
            ''Enoch." Ancient papers which would doubtless have made this matter perfectly clear
            were thoughtlessly de- stroyed many years ago. Andrew N. Rankin, Esq., of Jamaica, N.
            Y., states that his grandmother's maiden name was Brown and that her father was a cousin
            of the murdered schoolmaster. She had often told him the story of the massacre and had
            not only called the master Enoch, but had given the reason why he was originally named
            Enoch. He was born in Ireland, where thirteen is considered unlucky. Being the
            thirteenth child in his father's family his parents sought to ward off bad luck by
            naming the child Enoch, after the first man ''who was translated without tasting death."
            See Gen. 5, 24. 'Squire 56 Enoch Brown Memorial — Appendix. Rankin (the father of A. N.)
            was a leading spirit in the work of exhuming the remains of the teacher and scholars,
            August 4, 1843. He also furnished, along with George W. Ziegler, Esq., the detailed
            account of the same, which was afterwards published by I. D. Rupp in the county history
            and inserted from time to time in the county papers. The Irish device to ward off bad
            luck from Enoch Brown seems not to have been very successful, and yet, humanely
            speaking, we can say, in the light of present surroundings, that there was good luck in
            the bad luck. Providence overruled the massacre, we believe, to secure from the
            Provincial govern- ment for Bouquet the reinforcements for which he vainly pleaded the
            year before. And but for this massacre and the self-sacrificing spirit shown in that
            fiery ordeal, history would know nothing of Enoch Brown, the martyred schoolmaster, and
            no monument would perpetuate his memory. ENOCH BR WN POE TR Y. The following is the full
            text of the poem, the last two verses of which form the inscription on the south side of
            the monument : A Poem — In Memoriam.* With anguish sore and bitter woe, The hearts of
            Konoshickf are wrung Alas ! the cruel Indian foe Has slain the tender and the young. As
            Rachel wept in Judah's land O'er infants slain by tyrant king, So Antrim wails her
            martyr band, Her homes with lamentations ring. As heroes fall, at duty's post, So fell
            the master and his school, A sacrifice, a holocaust, To border life and Quaker rule. The
            place is holy where they died, In Christian faith and childhood pure, And where they
            laid them side by side, In common grave and sepulture. *By a friend of the monument,

            And ye, who now in safety dwell, In Cumberland's enchanting vale, Revere the spot and
            mark it well, Where long was heard the mother's wail. For not in vain the martyrs die.
            Their death brings life to pioneers, Who gain the burden of their cry. Relief denied in
            former years. Bouquet has sought the tiger's lair With trusty lion-hearted men ; Kind
            Heaven grants the settlers' prayer. The Dove of Peace returns again — The tomahawk and
            scalping knife. Long red with Anglo Saxon gore. The symbols dire of savage strife. Are
            seen on Antrim's hills no more. The ground is holy where they fell And where their
            mingled ashes lie. Ye Christian people mark it well With granite column strong and high.
            And cherish well, forevermore, The storied wealth of early years. The sacred legacies of
            yore. The toils and trials of pioneers. THE QUAKER POET. While Prof. J. Fraise Richard
            was gathering data for the history of Franklin county, he wrote a letter to John G.
            Whittier, the New England poet, requesting him to write a poem on the massacre of Enoch
            Brown and the school chil- dren. The following letter was received by Mr. Richard in
            reply, viz: Oak Knoll, Danvers, Mass., ) 3d month 19, 1886. j Dear Friend : I am glad to
            know that the people of Franklin county have erected a monument to the memory of the

            children, and that the history of the county is to be written by thyself. In my state of
            health I do not feel equal to the exciting effort of writing a poem on so sad a theme.
            But I thank thee for thy letter and enclosed circulars, and am truly thy friend, John G.
            Whittier. HON. HORATIO SEYMOUR ON THE MONUMENT. In December, 1881, the Greencastle Press
            published a letter from Hon. Horatio Seymour to Rev. Cyrus Cort, stating that "it is
            time that our people are made acquainted with our obligations to the German and Holland
            lineages," and thanking him for an article on Baron Steuben, which Rev. Cort had
            furnished the Reformed Church Messenger about the time of the Yorktown Centennial
            Celebration. Mr. Seymour had been chiefly instrumental in having an invitation sent to
            the Steubens of Germany, by the Ameri- can Government, who he thought deserved it as
            well as the Lafayettes of France, to participate in that centennial cele- bration. Baron
            Steuben was the efficient drill-master and Inspector General of the Revolutionary Army
            at Valley Forge and vastly improved its discipline and effectiveness. He managed the
            siege and commanded a division in the trenches which was about to storm the camp of
            Cornwallis at the very hour that the flag of surrender was hung out. After the war he
            was for some years an elder in the Reformed church in Nassau street. New York city, in
            which church a memorial tablet was placed by his aide. General North, after the Baron's
            death. Mr. Seymonr recently celebrated his 75th birthday and at the same time his Golden
            Wedding. In connection with this event Rev. Cort sent him copies of several poems
            written a few months ago in honor of similar events celebrated by his uncles, Simon Cort
            at Denver, Col., and Daniel Cort at Zwingli, Iowa, and their wives. He enclosed at the
            same time one of the Enoch Brown circulars. Mr. Seymour promptly acknowledged the
            receipt of these documents in an autograph letter to Rev. Cort, which we believe will be
            of special interest now that the distinguished Report of Treasurer. 59 Statesman has
            passed away along with his beloved wife, under very pathetic circumstances. Utica, N.
            Y., July 9, 1885. My Dear Sir. — I am under obligations to you for sending me copies of
            your verses written on the Fiftieth anniversaries of the marriages of your kinsfolk, Mr,
            and Mrs. Simon Cort, and Mr. and Mrs. Daniel Cort. They are very happily conceived and
            expressed. I am also in- terested in the circular with regard to the Enoch Brown
            Monument. I have given some time and attention to the erection of monuments in
            commemoration of events. Such monuments have done much to teach about the past and to
            instruct with regard to duties of life and the vir- tues of patriotism, etc. We feel as
            we look upon them that the dead speak to us. A number of such monuments were put up in
            this section about the time of our national centennial year. They have done much to
            instruct and improve our citizens. I trust the effort to put up the Enoch Brown Monument
            was successful. Again thanking you for send- ing me the verses and the circular about
            the monument, I am Respectfully yours, Horatio Seymour. To the Rev. Cyrus Cort. </p>
